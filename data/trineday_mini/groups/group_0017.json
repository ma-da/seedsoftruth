I do not discount that there may be serious and significant differences between Democrat and Republican individuals, many of them members of Congress, and certainly in state legislatures. Yet at the top of the pyramid, where the power to set agendas resides, there is only *the *Agenda, and the primary difference between the two parties is the speed at which 'the Agenda' is advanced. It is fascinating how Bill Clinton began his presidential campaign with playing a Saxophone on live television, talking about his foray into marijuana, reminiscing about his protest of the Vietnam war, and ended up with perhaps the most conservative administration of any president in modern history. Later, Obama entered the stage as a candidate of change, only to accelerate and consolidate the hegemony of the political elite faster than any predecessor. But lets go beyond rhetoric and examine the records of the last five Presidents, and see exactly how similar their platforms were. * * * * Crime \"The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population. But it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. Indeed, the United States leads the world in producing prisoners, a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive American approach to crime and punishment. Americans are locked up for crimes - from writing bad checks to using drugs - that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries. And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations.\" - *New York Times*84 **At the end of Reagan's administration, the incarceration rate was 247 per 100,000 citizens**. The demand for prison space had been steadily increasing since the War on Drugs began. Under George H.W. Bush the incarceration rate had increased to 332 per 100,000. It is a common misconception that it is Republicans have the more punitive crime policies. **Under Clinton, the incarceration rate skyrocketed to 476 per 100,000.85 **The Clinton administration gave 30 billion dollars to states to fund and expand their prisons,86 and championed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that added 100,000 new police officers.87 The bill was written by current Vice President Joe Biden. The act also expanded the death penalty to be applicable to 60 more offenses, including drug trafficking, and eliminated funding for inmate education. Private prisons flourished under Bill Clinton.

As of 2013, the United States holds more prisoners than any other country in the world, including China, as well as a larger percentage of prisoners per population than any other country. For an even more sobering comparison, consider that the United States has more people imprisoned today, as a whole and per capita, than Stalin had under his archipelago of gulags.90** Louisiana is perhaps the best example of how corrupted the prison system can become when privatization runs amok. Louisiana has a largely private prison system, and currently has 1 in 86 adults incarcerated, twice the national average and three times that of Iran. Nearly two-thirds of these prisoners are serving time for non-violent offenses.91 Lobbying, along with an incentive of job creation, has resulted in some of the toughest penalties in the country, such as a potential 10 years in prison for writing a bad check. Over half of the prison population returns to the system in five years, without having received any rehabilitation, and being returned to communities devastated largely in part by the continued extraction of the population into prison for non-violent offenses. 84 *New York Times, *\"[U.S. prison population dwarfs that of other nations](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\" April 23, 2008 85 *USA Today, *\"[Study: Prisons Filled At Record Pace in Clinton Years](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-02-18-prison.htm),\" February 18, 2001 86 Ibid. 87 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act#Federal_Death_Penalty_Act) on the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act 88 (PDF Warning) ACLU.org report titled \"[Banking on Bondage](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/bankingonbondage_20111102.pdf)\" 89 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#Development_of_private_prisons_in_the_United_States) on the Private Prison System 90 *New Yorker, *\"[The Caging of America](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/30/120130crat_atlarge_gopnik),\" January 30, 2012 91 *New York Times, *\"[Plantations, Prisons and Profits](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/opinion/blow-plantations-prisons-and-profits.html),\" March 25, 2012 * * * * Arms Sales **On the campaign trail, Bill Clinton made this promise: \"I expect to review our arms sales policy and to take it up with the other major arms sellers of the world as a part of a long-term effort to reduce the proliferation of weapons.\"92 And then, in some astounding turn of events (or predictable, for those who have been watching closely), United States arms sales doubled in Clinton's first year in office alone.93** In 2006, the United Nations convened in order to create a \"comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__one-party-state-us.txt:2:c62a7463ac85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10219, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__one-party-state-us.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__one-party-state-us", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "policy and to take it up with the other major arms sellers of the world as a part of a long-term effort to reduce the proliferation of weapons.\"92 And then, in some astounding turn of events (or predictable, for those who have been watching closely), United States arms sales doubled in Clinton's first year in office alone.93** In 2006, the United Nations convened in order to create a \"comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms.\" The United States was the only country to vote against the measure.94 **In 2008, Obama signaled that he would change the course from the Bush administration and take steps to limit arms sales internationally.

According to ATF whistleblowers, in 2009 the U.S. government began instructing gun store owners to break the law by selling firearms to suspected criminals. ATF agents then, again according to testimony by ATF agents turned whistleblowers, were ordered not to intercept the smugglers but rather to let the guns \"walk\" across the U.S.-Mexican border and into the hands of Mexican drug-trafficking organizations.\" - *Forbes* **Senior ATF Agent John Dodson, who broke the Fast and Furious story, was alarmed when he noted that the crime rates and violence in Mexico and at the border increased significantly after he began allowing, under order, massive amounts of guns to cross the border into the hands of criminals and cartels.** \"Dodson said they never did take down a drug cartel. However, he said thousands of Fast and Furious weapons are still out there and will be claiming victims on both sides of the border for years to come.\" - *CBS*99 On December 14, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed on duty, with a gun given to criminals by the ATF.100 92 *Mother Jones, *\"[Arms Around the World](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Weapons/ArmsAroundWorld.html),\" August 1999 93 *Alternet.org *\"[Hightower: Clinton's Foreign Jobs Program](http://www.alternet.org/story/1429/hightower%3A_clinton%27s_foreign_jobs_program),\" April 25, 2000 94 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Trade_Treaty#UN_Resolution_61.2F89) on the Arms Trade Treaty 95 *Mother Jones, *\"[CHARTS: US Overseas Arms Sales More Than Tripled in 2011](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/charts-us-arms-sales-overseas-triples),\" August 29, 2012 96 *Mother Jones, *\"[Obama Administration Ducks for Cover on UN Arms Trade Treaty](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/obama-arms-trade-treaty),\" July 31, 2012 97 *Time, *\"[Obama Beats McCain in Defense Contributions](http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0%2C8599%2C1855478%2C00.html),\" October 31, 2008", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__one-party-state-us.txt:3:324c46f8bb6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10220, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__one-party-state-us.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__one-party-state-us", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "duty, with a gun given to criminals by the ATF.100 92 *Mother Jones, *\"[Arms Around the World](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Weapons/ArmsAroundWorld.html),\" August 1999 93 *Alternet.org *\"[Hightower: Clinton's Foreign Jobs Program](http://www.alternet.org/story/1429/hightower%3A_clinton%27s_foreign_jobs_program),\" April 25, 2000 94 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Trade_Treaty#UN_Resolution_61.2F89) on the Arms Trade Treaty 95 *Mother Jones, *\"[CHARTS: US Overseas Arms Sales More Than Tripled in 2011](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/charts-us-arms-sales-overseas-triples),\" August 29, 2012 96 *Mother Jones, *\"[Obama Administration Ducks for Cover on UN Arms Trade Treaty](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/obama-arms-trade-treaty),\" July 31, 2012 97 *Time, *\"[Obama Beats McCain in Defense Contributions](http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0%2C8599%2C1855478%2C00.html),\" October 31, 2008 98 *Forbes, *\"'[Fast And Furious' Just Might Be President Obama's Watergate](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2011/09/28/fast-and-furious-just-might-be-president-obamas-watergate/),\" September 28, 2011 99 *CBS, *\"[Agent: I was ordered to let U.S. guns into Mexico](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/agent-i-was-ordered-to-let-us-guns-into-mexico-03-03-2011/),\" March 3, 2011 100 *Los Angeles Times, *\"[ATF sought to downplay guns scandal, emails show](http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-0722-fast-furious-emails%2C0%2C7312598.story),\" July 21, 2011 * * * * Domestic Spying A 1999 *BBC *article titled \"[Echelon Spy Network Revealed](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-echelon-spy-network-revealed)\" began with the paragraph: \"Imagine a global spying network that can eavesdrop on every single phone call, fax or e-mail, anywhere on the planet. It sounds like science fiction, but it's true.\" The network, known as Echelon, traces its roots all the way back to the John F. Kennedy presidency, and had been expanding ever since.101 In 1992, the Director of the NSA described the goal of the program in simple terms: 'Global Access'.102 The agenda for mass surveillance was institutionalized long before most Americans recognize. Then there was George Bush's illegal warrantless wiretapping. Began in 2001, the program allowed the NSA to monitor communications between United States citizens and those abroad without appropriate checks and balances.103 Interestingly, the groundwork for warrantless wiretapping had actually been laid out by Bill Clinton.104 During his presidency, he slowly expanded the reach of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the capability of the NSA to classify and withhold information about their activities. When the revelations about the program were made in 2006, they were controversial, but Congress repeatedly renewed the NSA's license without much of an uproar from the public. By the 2008 election, citizens were growing weary of the spying program and Barack Obama capitalized on this sentiment. He vowed to end warrantless wiretapping and during his primary campaign he went as far as to say he would filibuster the extension of the FISA legislation, responsible for allowing the expanded spying capabilities.105 \"When I'm president, one of the first things I'm going to do is call in my attorney general and say to him or her, I want you to review every executive order that was issued by George Bush, whether it relates to warrantless wiretaps or detaining people or reading e- mails, or whatever it is. I want you to go through every single one of them and if they are unconstitutional, if they're encroaching on civil liberties unnecessarily, we are going to overturn them. We're going to change them.\" - Barack Obama, 2007106 He first broke this promise after winning", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__one-party-state-us.txt:4:111ca5d48d12", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10221, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__one-party-state-us.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__one-party-state-us", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "to him or her, I want you to review every executive order that was issued by George Bush, whether it relates to warrantless wiretaps or detaining people or reading e- mails, or whatever it is.

We're going to change them.\" - Barack Obama, 2007106 He first broke this promise after winning the primary campaign, in July 2008, when he was one of 68 Senators who voted to renew the NSA capabilities.107 Less than a year later, Barack Obama would vastly broaden the legal argument the Executive branch used to justify the spying, and exempted the Government from the possibility of being sued thanks to a liberal interpretation of a clause in the Patriot Act.108 **\"In other words, beyond even the outrageously broad 'state secrets' privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration, the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity, one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications (calls, emails and the like) and - even if what they're doing is blatantly illegal and they know it's illegal - you are barred from suing them unless they 'willfully disclose' to the public what they have learned,\" - Glenn Greenwald** On June 6th 2013, it was revealed that Barack Obama oversaw the largest infringement of the Fourth Amendment in the history of the United States with the construction of a veritable surveillance state, capable of tracking the movements and communications of every American citizen. **We now know that the NSA and United Kingdom counterpart GHCQ:** **• Collect the domestic meta-data of both parties in a phone-call.109** **• Set up fake internet cafes to steal data.110** • Have intercepted the phone calls of at least 35 world leaders, including allies such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.111 • Can tap into the underwater fiber-optic cables that carry a majority of the world's internet traffic.112 • Track communications within media institutions such as Al Jazeera.113 • Have 'bugged' the United Nations headquarters.114 • Have set up a financial database to track international banking and credit card transactions.115 • Collect and store over 200 million domestic and foreign text messages each day.116 • Collect and have real-time access to browsing history, email, and social media activity.

Internal documents show that the NSA is attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with \"extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction.\"134 The documents revealed a top-secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Unit, or JTRIG. Two of the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in an effort to discredit a target, and to use social sciences such as psychology to manipulate online discourse and activism in order to generate a desirable outcome. **The unit posts false information on the internet and falsely attributes it to someone else, pretend to be a 'victim' of a target they want to discredit, and posts negative information on various forums.

The use of psychological techniques to fracture activist groups and to 'game' online discourse is very interesting. One document describes creating tension in a group by exploiting personal power, pre-existing cleavages and minor ideological differences. In online discourse, another document describes how to use 'mirroring' of language cues, expressions and emotions, and the adjustment of speech, patterns and language to manipulate opinion. Consider the words of former NSA employee turned whistleblower Russ Tice: \"**They went after - and I know this because I had my hands literally on the paperwork for these sort of things - they went after high-ranking military officers; they went after members of Congress, both Senate and the House, especially on the intelligence committees and on the armed services committees and some of the ... judicial**. But they went after other ones, too. They went after lawyers and law firms. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. **One of the judges is now sitting on the ****Supreme Court.

They went after ... U.S. companies that that do international business. They went after U.S. banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs ... like the Red Cross, people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few antiwar civil rights groups. Don't tell me that there's no abuse, because I've had this stuff in my hand and looked at it. And in some cases, I literally was involved in the technology that was going after this stuff. And you know, when I said to [former MSNBC show host Keith] Olbermann, [that] my particular thing is high tech and you know, what's going on is the other thing, which is the dragnet. The dragnet is what Mark Klein is talking about, the terrestrial dragnet. Well my specialty is outer space. I deal with satellites, and everything that goes in and out of space.

Though it is important to quantify 'official' because there has not been a true declaration of war since World War II. After all, Bill Clinton dropped bombs on no less than four sovereign countries: Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, and Sudan. And Clinton was able to get away with maintaining one of the darkest stains on America's soiled history: the full-force economic sanctions against Iraq that began with the first Gulf war and ended after Saddam's fall in 2003. The sanctions killed 567,000 *children *according to the British Medical Societies *Lancet*.137 (Later studies have argued the number 350,000 children to be more accurate). The total number of deaths including adults is thought to be much higher. **United Nations ambassador Madeline Albright, when asked about these numbers, coldly stated \"The price is worth it.\" This statement truly illuminates the attitude of those who set the agenda: Cold indifference to life on the grand chessboard of geopolitics.** Obama's first major act of war was a no-fly zone over Libya which resulted in the removal of Muammar Gaddafi. The media had a well orchestrated propaganda campaign that garnered significant public support. His second major act of war was the arming of Syrian rebels, undoubtedly prolonging the horrific civil war. Some of the groups that form the opposition are terrorist organizations, which mirrors the policies of Carter and Reagan arming terrorist groups in Afghanistan under Operation Cyclone.138 But the true depths of Obama's war mongering resides in his constant and silent drone war. A policy that started under W. Bush, **Obama has expanded the use of drones extensively. He has allowed the usage of Signature Strikes, whereby drone operators bomb people they do not know, based on movements they find suspicious.139** Worst of all is the policy of double tapping, bombing the same scene twice after rescuers have come to try and help their fellow citizens.140 Obama's drones have even bombed funerals.141 While the death toll of the drone war may not be as high as the conventional wars of the Bush family, the moral depravity certainly gives them a run for their money. The argument that drones are an alternative method to direct personnel involvement leaves out these cold facts. **It is important to note the presence of 'blowback': the concept that bombing funerals and responders to attacks will create a whole new generation of terrorists. It is almost a forbidden word in the mainstream media. **For example, Ron Paul was ridiculed by pundits across the political spectrum on cable television when he insisted that blowback was a reality.

While they deny it in public, many groups secretly relish the idea that their intangible enemy will only grow stronger while their profits grow larger. Drones are helping usher in the era of endless war. Another aspect of Barack Obama's capacity to wage war lies in his secretive 'kill list', which is a collection of singled out individuals deemed to pose a threat to the United States and have been selected for targeted killing.142 The list is known to include American citizens such as Anwar Al Alwaki, raising serious questions regarding human rights and legality.143 137 *The Nation, *\"[A Hard Look at Iraq Sanctions](http://www.thenation.com/article/hard-look-iraq-sanctions),\" November 15, 2001 138 *ABC News, *\"[U.S. Declares Syria Rebel Group Terrorists, Sending Message to Opposition](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/12/u-s-declares-syria-rebel-group-terrorists-sending-message-to-opposition/),\" December 12, 2012 139 *New York Times, *\"[The 'Signature Strikes' Program](http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/the-signature-strikes-program/),\" May 29, 2013 140 *The Guardian, *\"[US drone strikes target rescuers in Pakistan - and the west stays silent](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan),\" August 20, 2012 141 *Salon, *\"[U.S. Again Bombs Mourners](http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/obama_again_bombs_mourners/),\" June 4, 2012 142 *The Guardian, *\"[Obama's secret kill list - the disposition matrix](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/obama-secret-kill-list-disposition-matrix),\" July 14, 2013 143 *New York Times, *\"[Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\" March 29, 2012 * * * * Private Military and Intelligence Contractors It has always been hard to tell exactly how many private contractors are employed by the Federal government, and how many of those are under the umbrella of the defense industry. It was under Reagan that the Pentagon's privatization agenda began, and it has continued ever since. An NYU study on the size of government shows that the use of private contractors increased under the Clinton administration by about 25%.144 It is known that Clinton hired KBR, at the time owned by Halliburton, to build military bases and support troops in Kosovo.145 **It was under the administration of George W. Bush, with the Iraq war, when the use of private contractors skyrocketed. By 2008, the number of private contractors in use in Iraq was 155,000, more than the number of troops, a degree of privatization unprecedented in modern warfare.146 The public became acquainted with the likes of Blackwater under the Bush administration, with events such as the unprovoked massacres in Baghdad and Fallujah.147** During his campaign, Obama promised to cut federal spending on private contractors.148 It soon became clear, however, that much of the stimulus money would go straight to their pockets.

His Afghanistan surge was primarily accomplished through contractors, which made up half of the military forces in the country by 2009.149 The total number of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan quickly reached 250,000.150 Security contractors (e.g. private military forces) increased by over 400% under Obama and represent a quarter of all contractors employed by the Pentagon.151 The most shocking use of contractors has only recently been revealed. It turns out that they represent a significant amount of the NSA workforce. 483,000 people are employed by private contractors that work with the NSA and have 'Top Secret' access.152 The potential for illicit spying and extortion represented by these numbers is so high as to reach certainty. 144 \"[Fact Sheet on the New True Size of Government](http://wagner.nyu.edu/files/news/truesize.pdf),\" NYU, Published for the Brookings Institution (PDF Warning) 145 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBR_(company)) on KBR 146 *The Christian Science Monitor, *\"[A lesson from Iraq war: How to outsource war to private contractors](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0319/A-lesson-from-Iraq-war-How-to-outsource-war-to-private-contractors),\" March 19, 2013 147 *USA Today, *\"[What Exactly Happened That Day in Fallujah?](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-06-10-fallujah-deaths_N.htm?csp=usat.me)\" June 11, 2007 148 *National Journal, *\"[Cut Federal Contract Spending By At Least 10 Percent](http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/),\" June 10, 2009 (If link fails, [check here](https://web.archive.org/web/20091129093949/http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/)) 149 *Talking Points Memo, *\"[DOD: Obama's Afghan Surge Will Rely Heavily On Private Contractors](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/dod-obama-s-afghan-surge-will-rely-heavily-on-private-contractors),\" December 15, 2009 150 *CommonDreams, *\"[Obama Has 250,000 'Contractors' in Iraq and Afghan Wars, Increases Number of Mercenaries](https://web.archive.org/web/20160419104356/https://www.commondreams.org/news/2009/06/01/obama-has-250000-contractors-iraq-and-afghan-wars-increases-number-mercenaries),\" June 1, 2009, written by Jeremy Scahill 151 *Salon, *\"[Obama resides over a private contractor boom](http://www.salon.com/2011/02/24/afghanistan_private_contractors/),\" February 24, 2004 152 *Salon, *\"[500,000 contractors can access NSA data hordes](http://www.salon.com/2013/06/11/500000_contractors_can_access_nsa_data_hoards/),\" June 11, 2013 * * * * Renditions **The CIA has an official policy of 'rendition', where they send suspected terrorists to be interrogated in foreign countries, bypassing United States torture laws.** The process was used extensively during George W.

We reutilized more than $500M, that is million with an M, worth of property in FY 11.

This ability incentivizes sending out specialized, militarized police such as SWAT teams to serve drug warrants, as the teams themselves are expensive to maintain. This program started long before the Obama presidency, but recently it has swelled, with the Justice Department Forfeiture fund reaching $1.8 billion in 2011, with nearly half of a billion being returned to the local police departments that led the raid.159 156 *Huffington Post, *\"[7 Ways The Obama Administration Has Accelerated Police Militarization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/obama-police-militarization_n_3566478.html),\" July 10, 2013 157 Disposition Services, \"[October 2011 Newsletter](http://www.nd.gov/surplus/docs/lesonews_vol3.pdf).\" (PDF Warning) 158 *Reason, \"*[Police in Columbia, South Carolina and 499 Other Cities Get \"Free\" Tanks](http://reason.com/blog/2013/11/18/police-in-columbia-south-carolina-and-49),\" November 18, 2013 159 *Huffington Post, *\"[7 Ways The Obama Administration Has Accelerated Police Militarization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/obama-police-militarization_n_3566478.html),\" July 10, 2013 * * * * Globalization **A key process in globalization involves removing national sovereignty in favor of trade agreements that favor the rights of corporations.** Bill Clinton championed the NAFTA agreement, which among other issues superseded articles in the Mexican constitution, water rights in Canada, and allows corporations to sue nations when they are in violation of the trade act.160 Regardless of your opinion on NAFTA and other trade agreements, Obama has taken the concept", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__one-party-state-us.txt:13:2af825e682ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10230, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__one-party-state-us.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__one-party-state-us", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "Police Militarization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/obama-police-militarization_n_3566478.html),\" July 10, 2013 * * * * Globalization **A key process in globalization involves removing national sovereignty in favor of trade agreements that favor the rights of corporations.** Bill Clinton championed the NAFTA agreement, which among other issues superseded articles in the Mexican constitution, water rights in Canada, and allows corporations to sue nations when they are in violation of the trade act.160 Regardless of your opinion on NAFTA and other trade agreements, Obama has taken the concept of corporate power over national sovereignty to a whole new mind-blowing level with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a trade proposal that only recently became public knowledge when the documents were leaked (Check the footnote to read the whole document).161 Why the secrecy? **The TPP agreement bestows radical new powers on corporations, including establishing an international tribunal that would override domestic law and would have the power to issue sanctions against governments for failing to abide by their ruling.** The TPP runs contrary to Obama's statement during his 2008 presidential campaign: \"We will not negotiate bilateral trade agreements that stop the government from protecting the environment, food safety, or the health of its citizens; give greater rights to foreign investors than to U.S. investors; require the privatization of our vital public services; or prevent developing country governments from adopting humanitarian licensing policies to improve access to life-saving medications.\"162 Congressman Alan Grayson summed it up nicely: \"It's all about tying the hands of democratically elected governments, and shunting authority over to the non-elected for the benefit of multinational corporations. It's an assault on democratic government.\"163 The TPP has what is called an 'investor-state dispute settlement mechanism' which allow companies and investors to sue governments for losses of profits due to the government's policies.164 The deliberations would be undertaken by an international group of corporate lawyers and threatens to overrule democracies and threaten our legal rights. **It is not an exaggeration to say that in many instances this agreement gives more power to corporations than governments.** 160 [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement) on NAFTA 161 [TPP Document](http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tppinvestment.pdf) 162 (PDF Warning) 2008 DNCC Platform, [http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2008DemocraticPlatformbyCmte_08-13-08.pdf](http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2008DemocraticPlatformbyCmte_08-13-08.pdf)[available here](http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2008DemocraticPlatformbyCmte_08-13-08.pdf). 163 *Huffington Post, *\"[Alan Grayson On Trans-Pacific Partnership: Obama Secrecy Hides 'Assault On Democratic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/alan-grayson-trans-pacific-partnership_n_3456167.html)[Government](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/alan-grayson-trans-pacific-partnership_n_3456167.html)',\" June 18, 2013. 164 Union Solidarity International, \"[TPP and TTIP: the corporate coup behind the acronyms](http://usilive.org/tpp-ttip-corporate-coup/),\" November 18, 2013 * * * * Conclusion The One-Party State is the result of special interests, economic and military intelligence having gained a strong enough foothold in Washington to subvert the political process.

The saying that power is in guns and money has never been truer.

Consider the major initiatives of the Obama presidency. His Affordable Care Act has been championed as a bastion of liberal reform, but in reality it is simply forcing Americans to purchase health plans from private corporations. His raising of the top tax bracket is proffered as proof of a liberal agenda, however the tax burden is still squarely on the middle class. In addition, the wealthiest Americans are virtually unaffected, as their wealth resides in assets and investments, not income. We are left with a platform that is nearly indistinguishable from his predecessors, from which Obama promised significant change. **When George Bush bombs a foreign country, liberals cry foul and protest in droves. When Obama does the same thing, the previous protestors often become supporters of the policy. The same phenomenon can be seen on the other side of the aisle. Conservatives are quick to criticize the expansion of programs under Democratic presidents, but stand silent while Reagan and the Bush family oversaw many of the largest expansions of the Federal government and budget in the history of the United States.** It should be clear after even a cursory inspection of the legacies of presidencies from the last 30 years that there is very little tangible differences between the two parties. The shockingly establishment-oriented agenda of Barack Obama ought to be waking up millions of people to this truth. Can we work within the system to change the One Party State? How do we approach future elections knowing that there are no real alternatives to be found within the two parties? Even candidates with exceptionally favorable rhetoric cannot be trusted to translate their platform into actual policies. It is possible to dismiss the previous two chapters as a result of 'market forces', that endless war and the One-Party state are the result of uncoordinated actors in a free market. Even if this was the case, the implications and subsequent need for reform would be tremendous. The result can accurately be described as the dirty 'F' word: Fascism. I understand that there will be a lot who disagree with this designation; I argue that the term has many different meanings and many prominent people have used it in different ways. If you feel that another term best describes the phenomenon, that is OK, ultimately it is not important what semantics we apply. Fascism (or whichever term you prefer) is appropriate because the system has evolved into collusion between the military and economic entities to mutually ensure each others entrenchment.

What is responsible for the massive disconnect between lack of differences between presidential candidates and the vitriolic rhetoric in the media and on Capitol Hill? 2. Why has Barack Obama reversed his position on so much of his campaign platform? 3. What forces are the driving factors in the constant overseas military and economic hegemony? 4. Who is driving the creation of agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and where does the order of secrecy come from? 5.

But look more carefully. Follow the outer line around and see what happens. Follow any of the \"spiraling\" lines and see what happens. You may be surprised.\n\nThis optical illusion - called the \"intertwining illusion\" is the subject of study by researchers around the world. Because optical illusions harness the shift between what the eyes see and what the brain perceives, teasing out how that shift happens enables scientists to understand the inner workings of the human visual system.\n\nIn this case, the visual system receives conflicting cues: Some say \"circle,\" and some say \"spiral.\" At the periphery of your vision, the spiral cues win. Although the squares actually form rings, the tilt of the squares is consistent with a spiral. The offset between the black squares in one ring with the black squares in neighboring rings also creates the perception of a spiral, as does the offset between the white squares in adjacent rings. The spiral cues beat out the circle cues.\n\nWhen the brain tries to make sense of complex stimuli, it perceives 3D scenes it might actually be standing in front of, rather than 2D images that it didn't evolve to understand.\n\nSo, when your brain decides that those rings are actually spirals, it's probably not deciding they're spirals lying within a flat surface in front of you. Instead, spirals in real life are more often due to something going in a circle while simultaneously changing in distance from you.\n\nFor another truly mind boggling optical illusion, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/opticalillusions/optical_illusions_dots).

The surrounding yellow dots soon magically disappear; at times singly, in pairs, or all three simultaneously. A steady stare favors disappearance, while blinking and moving your eyes brings them back. In reality, the three yellow dots are always there!\n\n**Variations on this optical illusion:** If you go to [this webpage](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-mib/index.html), you can use the \"slower\" and \"faster\" buttons to the right of the image there to change the speed of rotation. The optical illusion persists down to surprisingly low speeds. Use the \"larger\" and \"smaller\" buttons to change the size of the yellow dots.

One of these two shared how she has almost no one in her personal life with whom she can have meaningful conversations about all of the major cover-ups going on in our world and what we can do about it.

Then do a search for \"PEERS Explorers\" to see if someone has already set up a group in your area.** If not, consider creating your own meetup group, particularly if you live in a large population center. To create your own group, click on \"Create a Meetup.\" Where it then asks what your meetup is about, click on \"Explorers and Seekers.\" Then name your group [city] PEERS Explorers. If you are in a town or small city, consider entering a larger town or city near you. This way, anyone searching will easily be able to find you. **Note that though it's free to create a Meetup account, join a group, or attend a meetup, setting up a new group costs $10/month, so it may be best to only do this if you live in a large population center.** Even then, there is no guarantee others will sign up and be interested, but if you are in a larger city, it might be a great way to connect with some cool people in person.

Yet the courses tie all of this information together in a such way that people can understand the big picture, see our role in it all, and be inspired to join in transforming our lives and world. Of the 160 course graduates so far, over half have written that their lives were significantly transformed, and almost everyone deeply appreciated all they gained from these powerfully mind-expanding courses. One San Francisco area man had developed a strange nervous disorder which led to a disturbing divorce and the loss of his lucrative job. His once successful, relatively happy life began to fall apart in front of his eyes. Yet after watching the revealing course video on the dangers of aspartame in the lesson on health, he realized that his habit of consuming many diet drinks every day may have caused his debilitating disorder. Once he stopped drinking diet sodas and cut out all aspartame from his diet, he was thrilled before long to be able to return to a normal, healthy life. Here's what he wrote: *I just wanted to let you know that I am so grateful to have found this course. What a HUGE gift it has been for me! I am healing in ways I had no hope of healing.* ~ Brian Another woman wrote us a letter which began \"I think you literally saved my life.\" A couple years ago, as she began for the first time to learn about all of the major conspiracies happening in our world, fear rapidly overtook her former life of peace and serenity. Struggling then to convince those around her of the urgency of all that is going on, she found herself rejected and shunned again and again. She wrote, \"It would have been a tight race to see which would be my demise - fear or friend with gun.\" Yet at the height of her despair, she found both powerful information and true hope and inspiration in one of our courses. Her life was dramatically transformed for the better. **Below are brief descriptions and links to three courses which might interest you. **If you are ready for a rich journey which both connects the dots of all that is going on behind the scenes in our world, and gives real hope and inspiration for how we can transform it all, explore below to see which course is most appropriate for you.

And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations.\"** ~~ *New York Time*s article on the corrupt prison-industrial complex in the US, 4/23/08 Dear friends, Like the [military-industrial complex](https://www.WantToKnow.info/militarycorruptionnewsarticles), the prison-industrial complex is rife with a great variety of corruption and cover-ups, as has been widely reported in the press. With greed and graft rampant, the prisons industry often breeds criminals and sends innocent people to their death. It's time for us to wake up and do something about it. Below is a collection of revealing excerpts from major media news articles showing the dire need for major transformation in our prisons system. **It's time to get the greed and profit out of punishment and replace it with true rehabilitation, as is happening now in some Scandinavian countries.** It's time to turn the prison-industrial complex into a place where the huge amount of money spent is used not only to keep us safe, but to give public offenders a real chance to turn their lives around. You can make a difference right now by educating yourself to the disturbing truths mentioned in the articles below, and then spreading this important news not only to your friends and colleagues, but to politicians and others who can help to transform the prison-industrial complex from a money machine into a place designed for justice and rehabilitation. See the \"[What you can do](#what)\" section below for more on how you can play your role in this important endeavor. And thanks for caring. With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) Former [White House interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) and [whistleblower](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) **Note:** Explore our [full index](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) to revealing excerpts of key major media news articles on dozens of engaging topics. And read excerpts from 20 of the [most revealing news articles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles) ever published. **Prisons, Privatization, Patronage** **2012-06-22, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/opinion/krugman-prisons-privatization-patro...](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/opinion/krugman-prisons-privatization-patronage.html) The New York Times has published several terrifying reports about New Jersey's system of halfway houses - privately run adjuncts to the regular system of prisons. The horrors described are part of a broader pattern in which essential functions of government are being both privatized and degraded. So what's really behind the drive to privatize prisons? One answer is that privatization can serve as a stealth form of government borrowing, in which governments avoid recording upfront expenses (or even raise money by selling existing facilities) while raising their long-run costs in ways taxpayers can't see. Another answer is that privatization is a way of getting rid of public employees. But the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-industrial-complex.txt:0:00957dd7ef66", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10248, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-industrial-complex.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-industrial-complex", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "of a broader pattern in which essential functions of government are being both privatized and degraded.

Another answer is that privatization is a way of getting rid of public employees. But the main answer, surely, is to follow the money. **As more and more government functions get privatized, states become pay-to-play paradises, in which both political contributions and contracts for friends and relatives become a quid pro quo for getting government business. Are the corporations capturing the politicians, or the politicians capturing the corporations?** One thing the companies that make up the prison-industrial complex - companies like Community Education or the private-prison giant Corrections Corporation of America - are definitely not doing is competing in a free market. They are, instead, living off government contracts. And ... despite many promises that prison privatization will lead to big cost savings, such savings - as a [comprehensive study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/181249.pdf) by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, concluded - \"have simply not materialized.\" A corrupt nexus of privatization and patronage [is] undermining government across much of our nation. **Note:** Have you noticed that [crime rates are at the lowest](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/hope_optimism_reasons#5) in many years, yet prison spending continues to skyrocket? Is something wrong with this picture? **U.S. prison population dwarfs that of other nations** **2008-04-23, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html) The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population. But it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. Indeed, the United States leads the world in producing prisoners, a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive American approach to crime and punishment. **Americans are locked up for crimes - from writing bad checks to using drugs - that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries. **And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations. Criminologists and legal scholars in other industrialized nations say they are mystified and appalled by the number and length of American prison sentences. The United States has, for instance, 2.3 million criminals behind bars, more than any other nation. The United States ... has 751 people in prison or jail for every 100,000 in population. (If you count only adults, one in 100 Americans is locked up.) The median among all nations is about 125, roughly a sixth of the American rate. \"Far from serving as a model for the world, contemporary America is viewed with horror,\" James Whitman, a specialist in comparative law at Yale, wrote last year in Social Research. **Prison sentences here have become \"vastly harsher than in any other country to which the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-industrial-complex.txt:1:8483d114fae2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10249, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-industrial-complex.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-industrial-complex", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "prison or jail for every 100,000 in population.

Indeed, said Vivien Stern, a research fellow at the prison studies center in London, the American incarceration rate has made the United States \"a rogue state, a country that has made a decision not to follow what is a normal Western approach.\" **Note:** Many people are not aware that violent crime in the US has dropped by over 50% in the last 15 years. Yet the prison population continues to grow rapidly at the same time.

CCA also said employees falsified reports to cover up the vacancies. The announcement came after an Associated Press investigation showed CCA sometimes listed guards as working 48 hours straight to meet minimum staffing requirements. The understaffing has been the subject of federal lawsuits and a contempt of court action against CCA. The [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org) sued on behalf of inmates at the Idaho Correctional Center in 2010, saying the facility was so violent that inmates called it \"Gladiator School\" and that understaffing contributed to the high levels of violence there. **In 2012, a Boise law firm sued on behalf of inmates contending that CCA had ceded control to prison gangs so that they could understaff the prison and save money on employee wages, and that the understaffing led to an attack by one prison gang on another group of inmates that left some of them badly injured.** **Note:** If the above link fails, use [this one](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/fbi-idaho-private-prison-firm) for the same Associated Press article on corruption in the prison-industrial complex reported on the website of the UK's *Guardian*. **Inside the Shadowy Business of Prison Phone Calls** **2015-07-02, *International Business Times*** [http://atavist.ibtimes.com/fcc-prison-telecom-industry](http://atavist.ibtimes.com/fcc-prison-telecom-industry) The prison phone business is a wildly complex, fiercely secretive and enormously lucrative industry.

[There are] an estimated 2.2 million inmates currently behind bars in America. If you've ever tried to call an inmate, there's a good chance you've heard of Securus, or its main competitor, Global Tel*Link (GTL). The two companies reportedly make up about 80 percent of the prison phone business, which drives about $1.2 billion per year in revenues. In the last few years, Securus, especially, has emerged into one of the largest, if not most secretive, prison technology companies in the business. The company employs 1,000 associates in 46 states, contracts with 2,600 jails and prisons across North America, and provides service to more than 1 million inmates and their families. Securus earned [$114.6 million in profits 2014](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/prison-phone-profits_n_7552464.html), on revenues of about $404 million. **When companies like Securus send proposals to jails and prisons around the country, they offer a percentage of the call rate back to the sheriff's office.

Criminal correction spending is outpacing budget growth in education, transportation and public assistance, based on state and federal data. **Only Medicaid spending grew faster than state corrections spending, which quadrupled in the past two decades**, according to [a new report] by the Pew Center on the States, the first breakdown of spending in confinement and supervision in the past seven years. **The increases in the number of people in some form of correctional control occurred as crime rates declined by about 25 percent in the past two decades.** As states face huge budget shortfalls, prisons, which hold 1.5 million adults, are driving the spending increases.

She had been raped, beaten with sticks and suffocated with her own underwear. Within days, police got confessions from two local teenagers, Henry Lee McCollum, 19 at the time, and his half brother, Leon Brown, who was 15. Both were convicted and sentenced to death. On [September 2], a state judge ordered both men freed after multiple pieces of evidence, some of which had never been turned over to defense lawyers, proved that neither Mr. McCollum nor Mr. Brown was responsible for the crime. DNA taken from a cigarette found at the crime scene matched a different man, Roscoe Artis, who is already serving life in prison for a similar murder committed just weeks after Sabrina Buie's killing. Virtually everything about the arrests, confessions, trial and convictions of Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown was polluted by official error and misconduct. **No physical evidence linked either man to the crime, so their false confessions, given under duress, were the heart of the case the prosecutors mounted against them. Both men's confessions were handwritten by police after hours of intense questioning without a lawyer or parent present. Neither was recorded, and both men have maintained their innocence ever since.** Equally disturbing, Mr. Artis was a suspect from the start.

Dozens of defendants sentenced to death in recent years have been exonerated before their sentences could be carried out, but many more were probably falsely convicted, said University of Michigan professor Samuel Gross, the study's lead author. \"Our research adds the disturbing news that most innocent defendants who have been sentenced to death have not been exonerated,\" Gross wrote in the study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. In their research, Gross and his colleagues examined the 7,482 U.S. death sentence convictions between 1973 and 2004. Of those, 117 had been exonerated in recent years, thanks to the efforts of numerous groups and a tide of public attention to issues surrounding the death penalty. **Gross and his co-authors ... estimated that about 4 percent of those sentenced to death were actually innocent, nearly three times the number exonerated during that period. Once inmates' sentences are commuted to life, they are far less likely to be exonerated,** mostly because there are fewer legal resources given to their cases, Gross said. \"If you were never sentenced to death, you never had the benefit - if you call it a benefit - of that process,\" he said. Although the study focuses on a period ending 10 years ago, the percentage of false death sentence convictions likely holds true today, Gross said. **FBI admits flaws in hair analysis over decades** **2015-04-18, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-matche...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-matches-in-nearly-all-criminal-trials-for-decades/2015/04/18/39c8d8c6-e515-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html) **The Justice Department and FBI have formally acknowledged that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000**.

BRYAN STEVENSON (Lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative): **We have a criminal-justice system that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.** I don't believe that America's system is shaped by culpability. I think it's shaped by wealth. TIME: 1 in 3 black men in the U.S. under 30 is in jail, on probation or on parole. Is this the scariest stat? STEVENSON: That 1 in 3 black males born in 2001 is expected to go to jail or prison during their lifetimes is more astonishing because it's about the future. And 1 in 6 Latino boys. That wasn't true in the 20th century. TIME: What do you say to people who say, \"It's easy to not go to jail-don't commit a crime\"? STEVENSON: In this country we have a presumption of guilt that follows young kids of color. I've represented 10-year-olds being prosecuted as adults. They are put in an adult jail. It's so unnecessary-we have juvenile facilities. No one defends it, and yet we still have 10,000 children in an adult jail or prison. TIME: What's the role of the corporations that build prisons?

The picture that emerges is one of convicts as chattel and a legal system essentially based on human commodification. • One in 86 Louisiana adults is in the prison system, which is nearly double the national average. • More than 50 percent of Louisiana's inmates are in local prisons, which is more than any other state. The national average is 5 percent. • Louisiana leads the nation in the percentage of its prisoners serving life without parole. • Nearly two-thirds of Louisiana's prisoners are nonviolent offenders. The national average is less than half. In the early 1990s, the state was under a federal court order to reduce overcrowding, but instead of releasing prisoners or loosening sentencing guidelines, the state incentivized the building of private prisons. But, in what the newspaper called \"a uniquely Louisiana twist,\" most of the prison entrepreneurs were actually rural sheriffs.

Ten of the inmates went to their grave before their names were cleared.** The leading causes of wrongful convictions include perjury, flawed eyewitness identification and prosecutorial misconduct. \"The most important thing we know about false convictions is that they happen and on a regular basis ...

The head of Sweden's prison and probation service, Nils Oberg, announced in November that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an \"out of the ordinary\" decline in prisoner numbers. Although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in Sweden's prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. A similar decrease is expected this year and the next. The Swedes [have] managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail terms rarely exceed 10 years; those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term, usually in the region of 18 to 25 years. **Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimise short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures - proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending. The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years - around half that in the UK.** One likely factor that has kept reoffending down and the rate of incarceration in Sweden below 70 per 100,000", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-industrial-complex.txt:8:4cda1983a85f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10256, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-industrial-complex.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-industrial-complex", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "**Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimise short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures - proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.

Unlike the UK, where a life sentence can be handed down to a 10-year-old, in Sweden no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison. **Note:** For a *Time* magazine article showing how Norway's prisons actually rehabilitate prisoners so that they can more easily fit back in society, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-sentenced-serving-good-life-norway).

One particularly stunning example is the American prison system, the realities of which should be a national disgrace. Some of those realities are highlighted in a recent lawsuit filed by the [American Civil Liberties Union](http://www.aclu.org) on behalf of prisoners at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF). EMCF houses severely mentally ill prisoners, with the supposed intent of providing both incarceration and treatment. Instead, the ACLU contends, the facility, which is operated by private contractors, is rife with horrific abuses. The complaint lists a litany of such horrors, [including]: Rampant rapes. Placing prisoners in solitary confinement for weeks, months or even years at a time. Rat infestations so bad that vermin crawl over prisoners. Many suicide attempts, some successful. Denying or delaying treatment for infections and even cancer. Stabbings, beatings and other acts of violence. Malnourishment and chronic hunger. Officers who deal with prisoners by using physical violence.** The [US] prison system is increasingly built and run by for-profit corporations, who have a financial interest in increasing the number of people in prison while decreasing the amount of money it costs to house them. Since 1980, the US prison population has grown by 790%.

But a concept called \"restorative justice\" considers harm done and strives for agreement from all concerned - the victims, the offender and the community - on making amends. And it allows victims, who often feel shut out of the prosecutorial process, a way to be heard and participate. In this country, restorative justice takes a number of forms, but perhaps the most prominent is restorative-justice diversion. There are not many of these programs - a few exist on the margins of the justice system in communities like Baltimore, Minneapolis and Oakland, Calif. - but, according to a University of Pennsylvania study in 2007, they have been effective at reducing recidivism. Typically,** a facilitator meets separately with the accused and the victim, and if both are willing to meet face to face without animosity and the offender is deemed willing and able to complete restitution, then the case shifts out of the adversarial legal system and into a parallel restorative-justice process.** All parties - the offender, victim, facilitator and law enforcement - come together in a forum sometimes called a restorative-community conference. Each person speaks, one at a time and without interruption, about the crime and its effects, and the participants come to a consensus about how to repair the harm done. The methods are mostly applied in less serious crimes, like property offenses in which the wrong can be clearly righted. The processes are designed to be flexible enough to handle violent crime like assault, but they are rarely used in those situations. **Note:** This deeply moving and highly educational piece from the *New York Times Magazine* about the power of restorative justice is well worth reading in its entirety at the link above. **Breaking the hold of corporate welfare on America's incarceration industry** **2012-12-19, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/corporate-welfare-incarce...](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/corporate-welfare-incarceration-industry) The US Department of Justice released [a report](http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/On%20the%20Chopping%20Block%202012.pdf) this week showing that 26 states have recorded decreases in their prison populations during 2011.

According to a recent report by the Sentencing Project called [On the Chopping Block](http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/On%20the%20Chopping%20Block%202012.pdf) (pdf), which detailed all the prison closures and attempted closures** in the past year, several state governors have been dragged into legal battles with state employees and unions who want the prisons to stay open. The private prisons, which are funded by the taxpayer ... need to generate revenue to keep their shareholders happy. For them, the bottom line is keeping their prisons full, regardless of need or cost.** Last year, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) came under fire when it emerged that they sent a letter to 48 states offering to take over any prisons going spare - with the small caveat that they be guaranteed 90% occupancy for the next 20 years. **Guantánamo leaks lift lid on world's most controversial prison** **2011-04-25, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison) More than 700 leaked secret files on the Guantánamo detainees lay bare the inner workings of America's controversial prison camp in Cuba. **The US military dossiers ... reveal how ... many prisoners were flown to the Guantánamo cages and held captive for years on the flimsiest grounds, or on the basis of lurid confessions extracted by maltreatment. **The 759 Guantánamo files, classified \"secret\", cover almost every inmate since the camp was opened in 2002. More than two years after President Obama ordered the closure of the prison, 172 are still held there. The files depict a system often focused less on containing dangerous terrorists or enemy fighters, than on extracting intelligence. Among inmates who proved harmless were an 89-year-old Afghan villager, suffering from senile dementia, and a 14-year-old boy who had been an innocent kidnap victim. The documents also reveal: • US authorities listed the main Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), as a terrorist organisation. • Almost 100 of the inmates who passed through Guantánamo are listed by their captors as having had depressive or psychotic illnesses. Many went on hunger strike or attempted suicide. • A number of British nationals and residents were held for years even though US authorities knew they were not Taliban or al-Qaida members. **Note:** For many key reports on government secrecy from major media sources, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecynewsarticles). **Sentenced to Serving the Good Life in Norway** **2010-07-12, *Time* Magazine** [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2000920,00.html](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2000920,00.html) On Bastoy,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-industrial-complex.txt:11:9adbbd9df841", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10259, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-industrial-complex.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-industrial-complex", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "100 of the inmates who passed through Guantánamo are listed by their captors as having had depressive or psychotic illnesses.

They go horseback riding and throw barbecues, and have access to a movie theater, tanning bed and, during winter, two ski jumps. Despite all its trappings, **Bastoy island isn't an exclusive resort: it's a prison.** **Bastoy's governor ... describes it as the world's first human-ecological prison **- a place where inmates learn to take responsibility for their actions by caring for the environment. Prisoners grow their own organic vegetables, turn their garbage into compost and tend to chickens, cows, horses and sheep. The prison generally emphasizes trust and self-regulation: Bastoy has no fences, the windows have no bars, and only five guards remain on the island after 3 p.m. In an age when countries from Britain to the U.S. cope with exploding prison populations by building ever larger - and, many would say, ever harsher - prisons, Bastoy seems like an unorthodox, even bizarre, departure. But Norwegians see the island as the embodiment of their country's long-standing penal philosophy: that traditional, repressive prisons do not work, and that treating prisoners humanely boosts their chances of reintegrating into society.** Norway's system produces overwhelmingly positive results. Within two years of their release, 20% of Norway's prisoners end up back in jail. In the U.K. and the U.S., the figure hovers between 50% and 60%.** Of course, Norway's ... prison roll lists a mere 3,300 inmates, a rate of 70 per 100,000 people, compared with 2.3 million in the U.S., or 753 per 100,000 - the highest rate in the world. **Note:** Why aren't other countries taking heed of Norway's excellent example? Part of the reason is that some companies make massive profits from the prison-industrial complex.

Testimony from a 12-year-old witness helped point to Jackson as the triggerman and led a jury to convict. The witness, Edward Vernon, now 53, recanted his testimony last year, saying he was coerced by detectives, according to Cuyahoga County court documents. Vernon wrote in a 2013 affidavit that he never saw the murder take place, but he was told by detectives that if he didn't testify against Jackson, his parents would be arrested.

Traditionally in the US these Spreads are a way to break the monotony of the prison food and to create a sense of community among the inmates. Typically, the Spreads are small and done by gangs", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt:0:2e1f1f29b74a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10264, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "prison word for a special fellowship meal prepared by inmates in their cells from items purchased at the commissary, combined with creative prison recipes, and shared with other inmates and usually 'spread' out on tables in the Day Room,** the main inmate gathering place. Traditionally in the US these Spreads are a way to break the monotony of the prison food and to create a sense of community among the inmates. Typically, the Spreads are small and done by gangs for their members or done by racially separate groups for those of their race: Whites with Whites, Blacks with Blacks, and Hispanics with Hispanics. But that is changing! **The \"gourmet\" Spreads Roger arranges are prepared on each cell block with great love and care by the inmates and then served in their Day Room for everyone - open and free to all inmates without regard to race or gang affiliation - something the inmates and guards have never seen before**. As one inmate wrote, \"I've not experienced anything like this in my 40 years in prison!\" Ronald Radford, the Administrator of the Roger McGowen International Support Group said, \"The observations I hear are that our financial support to indigent inmates, and especially the funding of the Spreads is creating more genuine inmate rehabilitation and transformation than any other program we know about. While it's true that we provide the money for the Spreads, the truly unusual thing about it is that the inmates themselves plan it, select the foods, prepare the dishes and serve their fellow inmates with an open and inclusive spirit that breaks down barriers and reveals the love and brotherhood waiting to be brought out. The genius and simplicity of it is that the inmates simply respond to Roger's and our love for them by showing love and care for each other - and thus transforming themselves and their prison community!\" This is clearly documented in the letters from inmates below. **While Roger McGowen was on death row, he started a tradition of always celebrating his birthday by finding a way to share a small Spread of snacks with everyone: White, Black and Hispanic inmates around his area.** In the last six years - since leaving death row Roger started enlisting the help of several trusted inmate friends to receive extra funds so they could work with him to create a much larger Spread on his cell block the on last Friday of each month. Soon this became known throughout the prison, and before long many at Wynne Unit wanted to be transferred to Roger's cell block to be a part of this transformed and friendly culture he had created there. Mr. Radford, the Fund Administrator, said, \"Last November, with the encouragement and additional funds from our donors, Roger recommended trusted inmates on other cell blocks to receive funds from us so they could put on their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt:1:22a66ca52c73", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10265, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "block the on last Friday of each month.

Mr. Radford, the Fund Administrator, said, \"Last November, with the encouragement and additional funds from our donors, Roger recommended trusted inmates on other cell blocks to receive funds from us so they could put on their own Spreads. The results have been astonishing and have led us to now fund these Spreads on 7 different cell blocks (with up to 160 inmates each) and in 5 smaller dorms (of 50 inmates). **We have also begun a new project of free Spreads of hygiene products such as deodorant and toothpaste for inmates in need. Even though there is a technical rule against inmate 'Spreads,' the new prison Warden is supportive and wants to allow all these Spreads to go on without interruption.** These monthly gatherings are transforming the attitudes of inmates and officers and changing the entire culture at Wynne Unit for the better - with Black, White & Hispanic inmates all joining together with high-five's, hugs and friendly greetings that transcend race or former gang affiliation.\" Roger feels that he and his International Support Group are creating a model for personal transformation and community building that could be replicated at other prisons. As Roger said, \"Some of these guys are going to get out of prison, and we feel that what we are doing will help make them better people and someone you will be happy to have as your neighbor!\" After Roger's big birthday party on his cell block last December, as well as successful \"Spreads\" being shared on other cell blocks, Roger has many guys tracking him down to thank him and give him a hug! Roger is constantly being stopped in the halls, Day Room and chow hall by guys who just want to shake his hand. Sometimes in the gym so many guys want to talk to him that he does not have time to do any exercise! One time, a group of guys gathered around Roger in the gym and a young man asked, \"Hey man, why do you do it? Why are you helping people you don't even know?\" Roger saw that he had the attention of a large group and said: \"I started sharing what little I had with friends back at Ellis Unit Prison over 30 years ago simply because I saw that they had nothing and no one supporting them. And, because I could help - I did. Also, I want to tell you that you do not know, and I do not know, the many people in the free world who donated the funds to our Support Group that helped you. I know some of you", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt:2:a5cb91374348", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10266, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "and said: \"I started sharing what little I had with friends back at Ellis Unit Prison over 30 years ago simply because I saw that they had nothing and no one supporting them.

I know some of you are going to get out of prison - and when you do, I want you to remember one thing. When you are out in the free world, if you ever get the idea to try to cheat or steal from someone, I want you to remember that person might have been one of the people who donated the money that you received.\" In that moment, Roger's wisdom and love touched many hearts in that group of guys and left many with tears running down their face - as everyone looked at Roger in amazed silence! Roger is known by the nickname \"Rock\" but recently some have also been referring to him as \"Prime Minister\" of the prison! In a letter to a donor Roger wrote a clear statement of how he views what he is doing: * **\"We are fighting hate on the front lines. Many of the guys who we are helping will one day re-enter society. We want them to take the love that they found here with them instead of the hate that came with them. We want them to spread the love that they now know instead of the hate they once knew. *** * So, I think I am where I am meant to be for the moment. When God thinks this task he has set for me is complete, perhaps there is nothing that will hold me in prison any longer. But until that time comes, I will continue to spread love as far and as wide as I can. And I thank you all for making it possible. You are the unsung heroes. I am, and all of us are putting forth the effort to make life better here. * *Our efforts are being written on the hearts of everyone to whom we have shown that love is the greatest power there is. We are making a difference and that is what counts. Love is not complicated, and I do not wish to make it so. I simply say thank you for the love. You are family now. We are related in love and bound by efforts to fight hate. We change minds by changing hearts and we change hearts by changing minds. And we can change the world one heart and one mind at a time.\"* How did this amazing 55-year-old Black man end up in prison, and what are his prospects", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt:3:e2973fe94897", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10267, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Love is not complicated, and I do not wish to make it so.

And we can change the world one heart and one mind at a time.\"* How did this amazing 55-year-old Black man end up in prison, and what are his prospects of getting out? Some of this was explored in the award-winning 2013 documentary film \"Roger McGowen Condamne a Mort #889\" by Swiss Filmmaker Nicolas Pallay. **Over 30 years ago Roger was arrested in Houston, Texas for a robbery and murder which was most likely committed by his older brother who had borrowed his car. After an intense and lengthy interrogation, the police prepared a confession which they coerced him to sign. ** By the time of his trial, his brother had been killed by police during another robbery. There was no evidence linking Roger to the crime, and despite his protests of innocence - with a drunk public defender who fell asleep at the trial - and the notorious racially biased Texas court system, **he was given the death penalty and sent to death row** where he endured the dehumanizing treatment and constant harassment for which Texas prisons are famous. Roger became another statistic in the criminalization and mass incarceration of Black men in the United States. In a hopeful sign, the new Warden at Wynne Unit Prison is working to implement a rehabilitation model of prison which is based on the idea that a man is more than the worst thing he has ever done and so it treats him as a full human being capable of improvement. The punitive model, which the previous Warden practiced, and which is prevalent in most Texas prisons is based on the idea that a prisoner is less than human and should be punished every moment of every day with disrespect, anger and deprivation leaving inmates feeling like they are being treated worse than animals. Because of the appeals system in US courts, some inmates have been known to stay on death row in these conditions for 20 to 30 years before the appeal process is exhausted and they are then executed. **From the time he arrived on death row and for the next few years, Roger undertook, alone, a long spiritual journey that led him from rage at the system and victimhood to an awakening to compassion, forgiveness, freedom and unconditional love** which he shared in his correspondence with Swiss writer and sociologist [Pierre Pradervand](https://pierrepradervand.com) who started writing to him through Amnesty International. When Roger was scheduled to be executed in 1997 Pierre and some Swiss friends, who also wrote to Roger, hired a US attorney who filed an appeal and stopped", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt:4:d3025bf4a54f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10268, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__prison-transformation-prisoners", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "next few years, Roger undertook, alone, a long spiritual journey that led him from rage at the system and victimhood to an awakening to compassion, forgiveness, freedom and unconditional love** which he shared in his correspondence with Swiss writer and sociologist [Pierre Pradervand](https://pierrepradervand.com) who started writing to him through Amnesty International. When Roger was scheduled to be executed in 1997 Pierre and some Swiss friends, who also wrote to Roger, hired a US attorney who filed an appeal and stopped the execution. Roger's letters to Pierre, along with Pierre's commentary, were published in 2003 in the book \"Messages of Life from Death Row.\" The book, published in French, became a bestseller, and with the income from the book and with donations from many people touched by his story, Pierre and his long-time friend in the US, Ronald Radford, an internationally acclaimed Flamenco Guitarist, hired a new attorney in 2006. At the same time, they formed the Roger McGowen International Support Group. All donations are sent to the Roger McGowen Fund Trust in the US where Mr. Radford, as Administrator and Trustee, disburses the funds in collaboration with Roger and the donors. Roger also provides inside information to help the Support Group advocate for prison reform, justice and fair treatment of inmates. In addition, **Roger and Mr. Radford work with the RSB group in France to conduct a pen-pal program that has matched over 75 inmates with group members in France,** and many them will be flying to Texas next February to visit their correspondents! **After ten years of work by Roger's legal team a US Federal District Judge finally ruled that Roger should not have been given the death penalty. **Then a plea agreement was made, and Roger was moved from death row to the Wynne Unit, a regular Texas state prison, with a possibility of parole in 2036. Currently, a new team of young tech savvy attorneys have digitized ten boxes of legal documents and continue to analyze, research and interview witness, in a major attempt to prove his innocence and get him released from prison. However, as Mr. Radford has said, \"When I talk with Roger on the phone, which is almost every day, it is clear that while he hopes the work of proving his innocence is successful, Roger's main focus and passion in life is the work he does with our International Support Group to help hundreds individual inmates in need and most importantly, to arrange the monthly fellowship meals (Spreads) for over a thousand inmates - which is literally transforming the culture and the mental, emotional and moral atmosphere of the prison.\" It could be said that Roger lives in a state of spiritual surrender and present moment awareness.** In one of his letters Roger, who considers himself to be \"spiritual but not religious\" wrote, \"Love is just one thought away.

Things are really and truly changing for the better, Mr. Ron. It's amazing how something as simple as a dormitory spread can have the ability to change a man from the inside out. It's such a joy for a man to discover something deep within himself that he never knew he had. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the love that each of these men emanate towards one another on a day-to-day basis. I've now come to realize Mr. Ron, that people can never give you what they have never received. Some people don't know how to give love because love has never been given to them. **This bridge that you and your members provide for my dorm has enabled me to realize, know, and understand that the most hardened of criminals can be shown how to love in ways that words alone could never explain. **We experienced that each day that passes. Brothers on my dorm have taken the initiative to create their very own dorm spread in honor of the love and kindness that the members of your organization have shown to us! And we'd like to thank you guys for what you've started on our facility. We can't thank you enough my friend. Peace and harmony Sir - that's what it's all about. **~~ Adrian Eleby** **PS:** Quick update on what's going on with the hygiene donations. With the help of you and the loyal members of [Roger's International Support Group](https://www.rogermcgowen.org/support-groups) I was fortunate enough to buy numerous tubes of toothpaste, soap, powder, lotion, deodorant etc. Everyone sends their love and appreciation to you and everyone involved in this very beautiful movement.

Your kindness and generosity towards us have enabled us to put aside our ethnic differences and has forced us to operate in Love, Peace and Harmony! We just can't thank you guys enough for what you all do for us. Thanks for all you do for the guys and me. Honestly, for me \"Thank you\" seems too small a phrase to meet a generosity so grand, yet not even a thousand \"Thank yous\" could express a gratitude this great! In this way it seems that your kindness has not only captured my heart but has conquered my language as well - for I am rendered speechless! \"Thanks a lot Ron!\" LOL!! But seriously, you must know that it is both an honor and pleasure to share this connection with such like-minded hearts. We all embrace our duties and this opportunity (blessing) with a very high level of integrity and sincerity, which we express through the preparation and serving of our fellowship meals. We challenge ourselves and each other to grow, and in this way, we are made better brothers, better people, and ultimately better chefs! LOL!! Each event is always better than the last one. So much so, that even would be adversities such as disgruntled officers and commissary complications all seem to dissipate in the wake of our movement. **How amazing it is to witness these brothers, separated by an assortment of differences made equal by kindness and appreciation!** How blessed I am to be joined with my brothers in their moments of great joy. Once more, my words defy me as a joy of this magnitude cannot be explained. Sadly, I am reduced to a simple \"Thank you!\" **~~ Lakim Guild** I just want to say thank you for the blessings you have given me. **Without your organization's kindness and generosity, I would be without hygiene and other needed things.** I do not have a family nor friends out in the world to help me, so when I receive a JPay from you and your International Support Group I know that someone somewhere cares about me. It makes me feel like I'm not worthless. **~~ Michael Moose** Last night we did another spread and had probably the biggest turn out yet.

We do things in an orderly fashion to where we have three tables that are set up in a row, and people can come straight down the line and then go take a seat. The capacity of the day room is 84 and there were over 100 people that turned out last night - so we had a line pretty much going around in a respectful manner. Even the officer in the block came to my little \"Nacho table\" with a big smile and said \"Oh my God, that looks good - and it's a lot!\" This time, I was able to more than double the meat I usually put out as well as add extra condiments. As usual, I got nonstop praise for the nachos! The other tables were able to step it up a notch as well and we definitely had enough food! **About halfway done serving, the lieutenant came and started screaming about sitting down and racking everyone up if we didn't sit down. This is probably the biggest anti-inmate officer we've got, but instead of putting a stop to it all, she allowed it to go on! No one was disrespectful, and no one shouted profanity - nothing. Which shows quite a bit about the environment that we have created.** When all the food was gone, we cleaned up and the atmosphere was joyous, with countless handshakes, and expressions of \"thank-you\" and \"God bless you!\" I always make it a point to tell people to please not thank me, but thank God, because it's him working through other people that makes this possible. Once again, it was nothing short of a blessing and an amazing experience. I am always humbled by the feelings that overwhelm me every time I can help make this happen. We greatly appreciate the love and generosity from you all. It has been the greatest blessing to be a part of this, and all of you are true examples of God working through people and answering prayers!

Then death came upon them and I felt as if I did not have a friend in the world. I am a practicing Christian and my faith is what I leaned on. I've met some good people in prison that would lift my spirits - which brings me to write this letter. Caught totally off guard one evening, an inmate whom I only encountered on occasion, spoke to me in the chow hall on one of those days when the meal alone would break down your spirit. He said, \"Hey Dave, how are you doing? \"My response was, \"I'm holding on.\" His response was, \"My condolences to you and yours. I heard about the loss of your family members.\" My response was, \"Thank you. That means a lot.\" In prison, it's not every day you find other inmates showing sympathy! This guy went on to say, \"I'm going to send you a gift!\" And I said, \"Oh yeah? What do you mean?\" He went on to explain how he was associated with a group of individuals who help guys while incarcerated by bringing them a ray of hope with a gift. **Now mind you, it has never happened to me while incarcerated during 15 years, that anyone would give you anything without asking for something in return. Now this ray of hope became real to me letting me know that there are people, total strangers, that don't know me from the man in the moon, so to speak who actually care! **That God has angels in place (for real!) - that he has people about his business, working, showing love, bringing joy to one's heart. Under the circumstances of incarceration, this Angel told me that I would receive a JPay deposit in my name, after giving him my information. Now, mind you, I have never received a JPay in my life. To receive one, as I did, telling me a deposit was made on my behalf... I had no choice, it brought me to my knees thanking God with the tears for the people he used to bring that joy. His Angel was \"Roger W McGowen - a.k.a. \"Rock!\" He did not know me, and to this day I think he only knew me briefly.

First and foremost, on behalf of the Wynne Unit I would like to say thanks to all the brothers and sisters who have help to provide the funds for the spread. You all just don't know what this really means to us! By you all showing love to this unit, it has brought a lot of people together. **At one point of time no race could eat with another race. But now, all you see is smiles when we sit all together with one another and enjoy the good food. What really touched me was when this 70-something-year-old man was almost in tears because he said he hadn't felt this much love in years. Not only that, but he hadn't been to Commissary in years. So, for me to bring him some food, let him know that some still care for him.** Brother Ron, to be honest with you I have been through some bad things and those things caused me to lose my way in life I was just living my life from day to day and not caring about anyone but myself. I never had any responsibility to do my best. I don't have any children and I've never been married and remain single. So, going from not having any responsibility to be the one that is over my cell block to make sure the spread goes right, turned that light back on in my heart that was out. I've been incarcerated for six years now, and by you all doing this for us really put a new outlook on life for me. Even though my family is not here for me, I still make it my business to help others even if it is just a hug or a warm smile. The only two things that keep me sane are 1. God, and 2. helping with the spread every month. Doing the spread gives me something to look forward to.

Brother Ron, Back home, I never gave myself a chance. All my life I've been a failure and that's something I just don't want to be anymore. I know I won't be locked up in prison forever, and I really would like to keep this going when I get out. Ron, thank you so much. Now I can shine my light through me to others. Between you and me, I believe I have finally found my purpose in this old world! When you get this letter, just smile - because that's what you're doing for a lot of brothers. And again, thanks so much to you all! **~~ Demarcus Osborn** **PS:** Coming to this place saved my life. I never felt more alive than now. I get to help change lives by making sure the Spread goes well: taking food to older guys who can't come out; making cakes out of cookies; and just sharing laughs! I don't know what I'm going to do when it is my time to go. I am going to miss this time that I'm sharing with my brothers. I want to take this with me to the free world and share with others how it brought brothers from different walks of life together. Brother Ron, when I get out, I now have another chance to right the wrongs in my life by giving back to people. I just want to share the love I have in my heart with others. **Note:** A website about Roger can be found at: [www.rogermcgowen.org](http://www.rogermcgowen.org).

But one has managed to quickly build influence with comparatively little scrutiny: Private prisons. The two largest for-profit prison companies in the United States - GEO and Corrections Corporation of America - and their associates have funneled more than $10 million to candidates since 1989 and have spent nearly $25 million on lobbying efforts.

The horrors described are part of a broader pattern in which essential functions of government are being both privatized and degraded. So what's really behind the drive to privatize prisons? One answer is that privatization can serve as a stealth form of government borrowing, in which governments avoid recording upfront expenses (or even raise money by selling existing facilities) while raising their long-run costs in ways taxpayers can't see. Another answer is that privatization is a way of getting rid of public employees. But the main answer, surely, is to follow the money. **As more and more government functions get privatized, states become pay-to-play paradises, in which both political contributions and contracts for friends and relatives become a quid pro quo for getting government business. One thing the companies that make up the prison-industrial complex are definitely not doing is competing in a free market.** They are, instead, living off government contracts. And ... despite many promises that prison privatization will lead to big cost savings, such savings - as a [comprehensive study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/181249.pdf) by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, concluded - \"have simply not materialized.\" A corrupt nexus of privatization and patronage [is] undermining government across much of our nation. **Note:** Few are aware that [violent crime rates have dropped to 1/3 of what they were in 1993](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/hope_optimism_reasons#5), yet prison spending continues to skyrocket.

But it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. Indeed, the United States leads the world in producing prisoners, a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive American approach to crime and punishment. **Americans are locked up for crimes - from writing bad checks to using drugs - that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries. And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations.** Criminologists and legal scholars in other industrialized nations say they are mystified and appalled by the number and length of American prison sentences. The United States has, for instance, 2.3 million criminals behind bars, more than any other nation. The United States ... has 751 people in prison or jail for every 100,000 in population.

The result is a per-inmate cost that is the nation's highest - and $2,000 above tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses to attend Harvard. Since 2015, California's per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. Critics say with fewer inmates, the costs should be falling.

The two companies reportedly make up about 80 percent of the prison phone business, which drives about $1.2 billion per year in revenues. In the last few years, Securus, especially, has emerged into one of the largest, if not most secretive, prison technology companies in the business. The company employs 1,000 associates in 46 states, contracts with 2,600 jails and prisons across North America, and provides service to more than 1 million inmates and their families. **Securus earned [$114.6 million in profits 2014](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/prison-phone-profits_n_7552464.html), on revenues of about $404 million.

She had been raped, beaten with sticks and suffocated with her own underwear. Within days, police got confessions from two local teenagers, Henry Lee McCollum, 19 at the time, and his half brother, Leon Brown, who was 15. Both were convicted and sentenced to death. On [September 2], a state judge ordered both men freed after multiple pieces of evidence, some of which had never been turned over to defense lawyers, proved that neither Mr. McCollum nor Mr. Brown was responsible for the crime. DNA taken from a cigarette found at the crime scene matched a different man, Roscoe Artis, who is already serving life in prison for a similar murder committed just weeks after Sabrina Buie's killing. Virtually everything about the arrests, confessions, trial and convictions of Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown was polluted by official error and misconduct. **No physical evidence linked either man to the crime, so their false confessions, given under duress, were the heart of the case the prosecutors mounted against them.

Dozens of defendants sentenced to death in recent years have been exonerated before their sentences could be carried out, but many more were probably falsely convicted, said University of Michigan professor Samuel Gross, the study's lead author. \"Our research adds the disturbing news that most innocent defendants who have been sentenced to death have not been exonerated,\" Gross wrote in the study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. In their research, Gross and his colleagues examined the 7,482 U.S. death sentence convictions between 1973 and 2004. Of those, 117 had been exonerated in recent years, thanks to the efforts of numerous groups and a tide of public attention to issues surrounding the death penalty. **Gross and his co-authors ... estimated that about 4 percent of those sentenced to death were actually innocent, nearly three times the number exonerated during that period. Once inmates' sentences are commuted to life, they are far less likely to be exonerated,** mostly because there are fewer legal resources given to their cases, Gross said. \"If you were never sentenced to death, you never had the benefit - if you call it a benefit - of that process,\" he said. Although the study focuses on a period ending 10 years ago, the percentage of false death sentence convictions likely holds true today, Gross said. **Note:** For more on the terrible injustices within the corrupt prison-industrial complex, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/prisonscorruptionnewsarticles). **FBI Investigates Prison Company** **2014-03-07, ABC News/Associated Press** [http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/apnewsbreak-fbi-investigates-prison-compan...](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/apnewsbreak-fbi-investigates-prison-company-cca-22819958) The FBI has launched an investigation of the Corrections Corporation of America over the company's running of an Idaho prison with a reputation so violent that inmates dubbed it \"Gladiator School.\" CCA has operated Idaho's largest prison for more than a decade, but last year, CCA officials acknowledged it had understaffed the Idaho Correctional Center by thousands of hours in violation of the state contract.

The police have a special inclination toward confabulation ... because, disturbingly, they have an incentive to lie. In this era of mass incarceration, the police shouldn't be trusted any more than any other witness, perhaps less so. That may sound harsh, but numerous law enforcement officials have put the matter more bluntly. Peter Keane, a former San Francisco Police commissioner, wrote [that] **\"Police officer perjury in court to justify illegal dope searches is commonplace.

The picture that emerges is one of convicts as chattel and a legal system essentially based on human commodification. • One in 86 Louisiana adults is in the prison system, which is nearly double the national average. • More than 50 percent of Louisiana's inmates are in local prisons, which is more than any other state. The national average is 5 percent. • Louisiana leads the nation in the percentage of its prisoners serving life without parole. • Nearly two-thirds of Louisiana's prisoners are nonviolent offenders. The national average is less than half. In the early 1990s, the state was under a federal court order to reduce overcrowding, but instead of releasing prisoners or loosening sentencing guidelines, the state incentivized the building of private prisons. But, in what the newspaper called \"a uniquely Louisiana twist,\" most of the prison entrepreneurs were actually rural sheriffs. They saw a way to make a profit and did. **Note:** To read the powerful 8-part investigation of the Louisiana prison system from the New Orleans *Times-Picayune*, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105041530/http://www.nola.com/prisons/).

Of these, 885 have profiles developed for the registry's website, [exonerationregistry.org](http://www.exonerationregistry.org). The details are shocking. **Death row inmates were exonerated nine times more frequently than others convicted of murder. One-fourth of those exonerated of murder had received a death sentence, while half of those who had been wrongfully convicted of rape or murder faced death or a life behind bars. Ten of the inmates went to their grave before their names were cleared.** The leading causes of wrongful convictions include perjury, flawed eyewitness identification and prosecutorial misconduct. \"The most important thing we know about false convictions is that they happen and on a regular basis ...

Criminal correction spending is outpacing budget growth in education, transportation and public assistance, based on state and federal data. **Only Medicaid spending grew faster than state corrections spending, which quadrupled in the past two decades**, according to [a new report] by the Pew Center on the States, the first breakdown of spending in confinement and supervision in the past seven years. **The increases in the number of people in some form of correctional control occurred as crime rates declined by about 25 percent in the past two decades.** As states face huge budget shortfalls, prisons, which hold 1.5 million adults, are driving the spending increases. Pew researchers say that as states trim services like education and health care, prison budgets are growing. Those priorities are misguided, the study says. **\"**States are looking to make cuts that will have long-term harmful effects,\" said Sue Urahn, managing director of the Pew Center on the States. \"Corrections is one area they can cut and still have good or better outcomes than what they are doing now.\" About $9 out of $10 spent on corrections goes to prison financing (that includes money spent to house 780,000 people in local jails).

The city paid $167,731 to feed, house and guard each inmate last year**, according to a study the Independent Budget Office released this week. \"It is troubling in both human terms and financial terms,\" Doug Turetsky, the chief of staff for the budget office, said on Friday. With 12,287 inmates shuffling through city jails last year, he said, \"it is a significant cost to the city.\" by nearly any measure, New York City spends more than every other state or city. The Vera Institute of Justice released a [study in 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20131030011043/http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/the-price-of-prisons-40-fact-sheets-updated-072012.pdf) that found the aggregate cost of prisons in 2010 in the 40 states that participated was $39 billion. The annual average taxpayer cost in these states was $31,286 per inmate. New York State was the most expensive, with an average cost of $60,000 per prison inmate. The cost of incarcerating people in New York City's jails is nearly three times as much. 83 percent of the expense per prisoner came from wages, benefits for staff and pension costs. **Some 76 percent of the inmates in the city were waiting for their cases to be disposed**. The wait times have grown even as the number of felonies committed in the city has declined. Since 2002, the time spent waiting for cases to be disposed of has [gone to 95 days](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/nyregion/justice-denied-bronx-court-system-mired-in-delays.html?pagewanted=all), from 76 days, [former city correction and probation commissioner Michael] Jacobson said. **Note:** This [CNN chart](http://money.cnn.com/infographic/economy/education-vs-prison-costs/) shows that most states spend two to three times as much on their prison inmates than they do on students in school.

In April 2014, the commission approved a reduction in sentences for certain drug crimes going forward. In his final months in office, President Obama has focused more on the need for criminal-justice reform. He has used the executive power of clemency to commute some of the most egregiously unfair sentences of 89 federal drug convicts. But a handful of pardons don't amount to much when there are hundreds of thousands of federal prisoners. Nearly half of federal inmates are serving time for drug crimes. Of those, 60 percent were subject to mandatory minimums when they were sentenced. **Stephanie George was a 26-year-old mother of three when she was convicted on drug-conspiracy charges because the man she was dating had kept drugs and money in her house.

From the mid-'80s to the mid-'90s, it doubled again. By 2007, it had reached a historic high of 767 people per 100,000. In absolute terms, America's prison and jail population from 1970 until today has increased sevenfold, from some 300,000 people to 2.2 million. **In 2000, one in 10 black males between the ages of 20 and 40 was incarcerated** - 10 times the rate of their white peers.

The impact could have been even more dramatic if the government had adopted the recommendations of a prison service report published in July, which concluded that eight jails and three youth detention centres will be surplus to requirements by the year 2021. The official figures indicate that recorded crime has been falling for around a decade. Between 2014 and 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available, recorded crime was down by nearly 5%, according to national statistics office CBS. In total, **recorded crime has shrunk by 25% over the past eight years. Crime figures [have] been falling in nearly all western nations this century, but the decline in the Dutch prison population has been spectacular**. In 2006 the Netherlands had the second highest number of inmates in Europe with 125 prisoners per 100,000 population. Only the UK, with 145, had a larger share. But by last year the Dutch were down to Scandinavian levels, with 69 out of every 100,000 citizens behind bars. The government says prison closures are inevitable because it costs too much to keep empty cells open. **Official forecasts predict that the downward trend in crime will continue**, though how far the fall reflects an actual drop in criminal behaviour remains a hotly contested issue. **Note:** Few are aware that [violent crime rates in the U.S. have dropped to 1/3 of what they were in 1993](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/hope_optimism_reasons#5), yet prison spending continues to skyrocket.

In fact, it is the first time the word \"slavery\" was ever mentioned in the Constitution and it is in this amendment where it is ... given the constitutional protection that has maintained the practice of American slavery in various forms to this very day**. It is why, right now, the largest prison strike in American history is about to enter its third week - the men and women inside of those prisons are effectively slaves. Their free or nearly free labor represents, according to Alice Speri, \"a $2 billion a year industry that employs nearly 900,000 prisoners while paying them a few cents an hour in some states, and nothing at all in others. \"In addition to work for private companies, prisoners also cook, clean, and work on maintenance and construction in the prisons themselves - forcing officials to pay staff to carry out those tasks in response to work stoppages. 'They cannot run these facilities without us,' organizers wrote ahead of the strike. 'We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves.'\" The entire [13th Amendment](https://www.google.com/search?q=13th+amendment) ... is just 47 words long. About a third of those words aren't about ending slavery, but are shockingly about how and when slavery could receive a wink and a nod to continue. In essence, the 13th Amendment both banned and justified slavery in one fell swoop. Slavery is legal in prisons. **Note:** It's strange to note that very few major media have given any coverage to this important story.

Written by UC Berkeley Professor [Michael Pollan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan), a *New York Times* best selling author, this profound article describes the beautiful healing of anxiety and depression among those facing death from cancer as a result of innovative trials of psychedelic therapy approved by the FDA. The title of the article is \"The Trip Treatment: Research into psychedelics, shut down for decades, is now yielding exciting results.\" [**http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment**](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment) As this engaging article is quite long and many won't be able to find the time to read the whole story, I've selected a few key passages here below to give a good taste of the richness presented. First, a paragraph discussing a landmark 1962 study as a historical background: Perhaps the most influential and rigorous of [early psychedelic] studies was the [Good Friday experiment](https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_journal2.pdf), conducted in 1962 by Walter Pahnke, a psychiatrist and minister working on a Ph.D. dissertation ... at Harvard. In a double-blind experiment, twenty divinity students received a capsule of white powder right before a Good Friday service at Marsh Chapel; ten contained psilocybin, ten an active placebo. Eight of the ten students receiving psilocybin reported a mystical experience, while only one in the control group experienced a feeling of \"sacredness\" and a \"sense of peace.\" [Pahnke concluded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Chapel_Experiment) that **the experiences of eight who received the psilocybin were \"indistinguishable from, if not identical with,\" the classic mystical experiences reported in the literature** by William James, Walter Stace, and others. Referring to recent studies with psychedelics and particularly psilocybin: The recreational use of psychedelics is famously associated with instances of psychosis, flashback, and suicide. But these adverse effects have not surfaced in the trials of drugs at N.Y.U. and Johns Hopkins. After nearly five hundred administrations of psilocybin, the researchers have reported no serious negative effects. N.Y.U.

But these adverse effects have not surfaced in the trials of drugs at N.Y.U. and Johns Hopkins. After nearly five hundred administrations of psilocybin, the researchers have reported no serious negative effects. N.Y.U. ([New York University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University)) has had a training program in psychedelic therapy since 2008. Research scientist Stephen Ross of N.Y.U. commented on the results of one study where psilocybin was being given to cancer patients to treat anxiety and depression with incredible results: **\"They were saying things like 'I understand love is the most powerful force on the planet.' People who had been palpably scared of death-they lost their fear. The fact that a drug given once can have such an effect for so long is ... unprecedented. We have never had anything like it in the psychiatric field.\"** Here are a few paragraphs from the article describing a study conducted at the [Johns Hopkins University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University) School of Medicine in the lab of psychopharmacologist [Roland Griffiths](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/1311852/roland-griffiths): Thirty-six volunteers, none of whom had ever taken a hallucinogen, received a pill containing either psilocybin or an active placebo (methylphenidate, or Ritalin); in a subsequent session the pills were reversed. \"When administered under supportive conditions,\" the paper concluded, \"psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences.\" Participants ranked these experiences as among the most meaningful in their lives, comparable to the birth of a child or the death of a parent. **Two-thirds of the participants rated the psilocybin session among the top five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives; a third ranked it at the top**. Fourteen months later, these ratings had slipped only slightly. Furthermore, the \"completeness\" of the mystical experience closely tracked the improvements reported in personal well-being, life satisfaction, and \"positive behavior change\" measured two months and then fourteen months after the session. A follow-up study by Katherine MacLean, a psychologist in Griffiths's lab, found that the psilocybin experience also had a positive and lasting effect on the personality of most participants. This is a striking result, since the conventional wisdom in psychology holds that personality is usually fixed by age thirty and thereafter is unlikely to substantially change. \"I don't want to use the word 'mind-blowing,'\" Griffiths [commented], \"but, as a scientific phenomenon, if you can create conditions in which seventy per cent of people will say they have had one of the five most meaningful experiences of their lives? To a scientist, that's just incredible.\" When, in 2010, [U.K. neuroscientist Robin] Carhart-Harris first began studying the brains of volunteers on psychedelics, neuroscientists assumed that the drugs somehow excited brain activity-hence the vivid hallucinations and powerful emotions that people", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__profound-video-rape.txt:1:a4314b4f364b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10294, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__profound-video-rape.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__profound-video-rape", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "don't want to use the word 'mind-blowing,'\" Griffiths [commented], \"but, as a scientific phenomenon, if you can create conditions in which seventy per cent of people will say they have had one of the five most meaningful experiences of their lives?

But when Carhart-Harris looked at the results of the first set of fMRI scans-which pinpoint areas of brain activity by mapping local blood flow and oxygen consumption-he discovered that the drug appeared to substantially reduce brain activity in one particular region: the \"default-mode network.\" \"The N.I.M.H. [National Institute of Mental Health] is not opposed to work with psychedelics, but I doubt we would make a major investment,\" Tom Insel, the institute's director, [said]. He said that the N.I.M.H. would need to see \"a path to development\" and suspects that \"it would be very difficult to get a pharmaceutical company interested in developing this drug, since it cannot be patented.\" **It's also unlikely that Big Pharma would have any interest in a drug that is administered only once or twice in the course of treatment. There's not a lot of money here when you can be cured with one session.** [Rick Doblin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Doblin), the director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ([MAPS](http://www.maps.org/)) [was asked if] he worries about another backlash. He suggested that the culture has made much progress since the nineteen-sixties. \"That was a very different time,\" he said. \"People wouldn't even talk about cancer or death then. Women were tranquillized to give birth; men weren't allowed in the delivery room. Yoga and meditation were totally weird. Now mindfulness is mainstream and everyone does yoga, and there are birthing centers and hospices all over. We've integrated all these things into our culture. And now I think we're ready to integrate psychedelics.\" For a great seven-minute video following one participant in the study featured in the above article, see [this webpage](http://video.newyorker.com/watch/a-reporter-at-large-magic-mushrooms-and-the-healing-trip-2015-02-02). Then watch a fascinating [six-minute video](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/g/lsd-1950s-housewife.php) of what happened back in the 1960s when a housewife was given LSD in a controlled experiment before the drug was made illegal. When used for purely recreational purposes, psychedelics can be dangerous and have been known to even cause some deaths. **Yet when used under carefully controlled conditions in scientific experiments conducted both in the 1950s and 60s and in the last decade or so, the results have been consistently positive, particularly in relieving anxiety and fear in a significant way.** You can read about many of the sometimes astounding results of these studies in the summaries of major media articles at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindalteringdrugsnewsarticles).

Chapter III: Psychopaths, Power and Politics \"There is no such thing, in the psychopathic universe, as the 'merely weak'. Whoever is weak is also a sucker; that is, someone who demands to be exploited.\" - Psychologist Robert Rieber165 Psychopathy What exactly does the word mean? Entertainment media bombards us with a particular version of the psychopath, one that is irrational, dangerous and violent. Someone who doesn't fit in, who 'just doesn't seem right'.

Is this an accurate description? Dr. Robert D. Hare, an eminent psychologist on the subject of psychopathy, portrays the disorder in a drastically different light. In his book *Without Conscience, ***he describes psychopaths as being conscienceless yet rational, not suffering from any insanity or debilitation; instead they are logical, manipulative, predisposed to crime, selfish and without guilt, shame, remorse or empathy.166** In other words, these men and women are not *mentally ill *in the sense that we traditionally imagine. Psychopathy is surely an illness, but it is not a neurosis that will manifest symptoms others can easily perceive. Often, the psychopath will be aware of his condition and completely conceal his aberrant traits. In *Without Conscience, *Dr. Hare presents numerous case studies and statistics to illuminate the world of the psychopath; the evidence points towards a world full of people programmed for evil. Dr. Hare stresses multiple times that the psychopath is someone who has a strong desire for power and the need to manipulate others, not for personal gain but simply for the sake of manipulation. While some psychopaths are erratic, others have the ability to completely conceal their condition behind a carefully constructed social persona. Dr. Hare's list of psychopathic personality traits include: • Displaying glibness and superficial charm • Being in constant need of stimulation and prone to excessive boredom • Acting in a conning or manipulative way • Showing shallow emotional responses • Acting out promiscuous sexual behavior • Behaving irresponsibly • Avoiding long term relationships • Feeling a grandiose sense of self worth • Lying repeatedly without remorse • Lacking any remorse or guilt • Lacking empathy for others • Having poor behavioral controls • Displaying behavioral problems early on in life • Behaving impulsively • Failing to accept responsibility for actions • Displaying signs of criminal diversity Dr. Hare's predecessor Harvey Cleckly, perhaps the first psychologist to study the psychopathic phenomenon decades earlier, compiled a similar list: • Superficial charm and average intelligence. • Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking. • Absence of nervousness or neurotic manifestations. • Unreliability. • Untruthfulness and insincerity. • Lack of remorse or shame. • Antisocial behavior without apparent compunction. • Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience. • Pathological egocentricity and incapacity to love. • General poverty in major affective reactions. • Specific loss of insight. • Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations. • Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink, and sometimes without. • Sex life impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated. Most of the case studies Dr. Hare presents in his book are from the prison population and anecdotal accounts", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__psychopaths-politics-power.txt:1:3a2c38265e8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10298, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__psychopaths-politics-power.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__psychopaths-politics-power", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "remorse or shame. • Antisocial behavior without apparent compunction. • Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience. • Pathological egocentricity and incapacity to love. • General poverty in major affective reactions. • Specific loss of insight. • Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations. • Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink, and sometimes without. • Sex life impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated. Most of the case studies Dr. Hare presents in his book are from the prison population and anecdotal accounts from those who have been abused. This is a natural, structural problem in the study of psychopathy: the study is limited for the most part to the 'Unsuccessful Psychopath', those who could not conceal their traits or whose social circumstances led to blue-collar crime. Yet Dr. Hare also spends some significant time devoted to **the 'Subdeviant Criminal', the psychopath who has control over his deviance and the ability to hide it from the populace. Instead of the petty criminal, these men and women occupy positions in business, government, industry, and law. Their condition goes entirely unnoticed by the populace; their employers, peers, even their family and those who love them are fooled.** How can such deception be possible? Consider that psychopathy is not an 'acquired' illness. Instead, it has strong genetic components and manifests itself in early childhood.167 168 169 170 From an early age, the psychopath recognizes that to fit into society in any manner they need to develop to ability to lie extensively. Over time, they become exceptionally good at it. Their entire public persona becomes one complex act, a web of lies to hide their deviant personality. 165 [Professor Robert W.

The true insights which can be derived from her work and those of other psychopathy researchers go much deeper than police brutality; they shed much needed light on the widespread relationship between evil and power. 171 *Association for Psychological Science, *\"[Everyday Sadists Take Pleasure In Others' Pain](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html),\" September 12, 2013 * * * * Secondary Psychopathy Understanding the nature of psychopathy alone does not reveal the full picture. Numerous researchers have differentiated between 'primary psychopathy', that which is genetic, and 'secondary psychopathy', that which is acquired through environment.172, 173, 174 Unlike the primary psychopath, who is born with their condition and lacks entirely the capacity for empathy and other higher human emotions, the secondary psychopath occasionally manifests these traits. In other words, non-psychopathic individuals can exhibit psychopathic behaviors through the conditioning of their environment. Two well known studies in psychology underscore this. The first is the [Milgram Experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment). A volunteer would be placed at a booth with an apparatus that sends an electric shock to a person in another room. The volunteer believes the man in the other room is a fellow volunteer; in reality he is an actor that is not actually receiving electric shocks. The volunteer asks the actor a series of questions, a wrong answer means the use of an increasingly high voltage of shocking.

The volunteer would be prompted by a man in a lab coat to continue administering the shocks long after it had become unsafe. The verbal prodding would range between 'Please continue' and 'You have no other choice, you *must *continue'. After the shock reached 300 volts, the actor would stop answering, but the man in the lab coat would continue insisting on shocks. **Dr. Stanley Milgram repeatedly found that nearly 2/3rds of people would continue to the maximum voltage of 450, long after they had believed their peer to be incapacitated.** Regarding the experiment, Milgram wrote: \"Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, **relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.\"** The second experiment is the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment). Volunteers were asked to simulate a prison in Stanford's psychology hall; half of the participants simulated prisoners and the other half guards. The guards were told to make the prisoners feel powerless though not resort to violence. Zimbardo, the lead experimenter, found that many of the guards stepped far beyond the boundaries of what had been predicted, leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. A third of the guards had displayed 'genuine sadistic tendencies'. Some prisoners were emotionally traumatized and had to leave the experiment early. Zimbardo argued that his experiment shows that people internalize authority and submission. Though the nature of the Stanford Prison Experiment does not lend itself to empiricism, it does give some credence to the idea that 'power corrupts' and changes people. Furthermore, an experiment published in August 2012 by the *Journal of Experimental Psychology *showed definite psychological changes associated with power. It found that people who considered themselves in positions of power literally perceived the world around them differently.175 We would like to think that humanity has evolved since these experiments took place, and since the atrocities that were revealed after World War II.

Most recently, it was revealed that the CIA made doctors and psychologists working at various Department of Defense institutions violate the ethical codes of their profession in order to become involved with the torture and degrading treatment of terror suspects.177 \"Medical professionals were in effect told that their ethical mantra \"first do no harm\" did not apply, because they were not treating people who were ill.\" - *The Guardian* The report, compiled by the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centers, supported by the Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP), found that doctors working with the Department of Defense and CIA routinely participated in waterboarding, sleep deprivation and force-feeding, the latter being against the rules of World Medical Association and the American Medical Association, while gathering and sharing intelligence. \"The American public has a right to know that the covenant with its physicians to follow professional ethical expectations is firm regardless of where they serve. It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice. We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.\" - Dr Gerald Thomson, professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia University and member of the taskforce. While participation in waterboarding and force-feeding may not be shocking to the desensitized public's sensibilities, it is still very revealing that **physicians and psychologists who would otherwise balk at the suggestion that they would violate their professions ethical codes, do so without hesitation when it is done in the name of War. And after all, the United States did sentence Japanese war criminals to death for the act of waterboarding during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East following World War II.178** Armed with this context, it is easy to understand the ease with which psychopaths can manipulate institutions and societies.

Over time, they begin to saturate important institutions, being more ruthless and willing to cause more destruction in their rise up the ladder of power than their competition. **In the exact same manner that you and I naturally exclude deviants from our social groups, psychopaths naturally exclude those of us who allow conscience and morality to influence our decisions and perceptions.

But first, I invite you to notice where you fall of the spectrum that ranges from Q lovers on one end to Q haters on the other. Particularly if you fall on either end of this spectrum, I invite you to open to your higher guidance and see if you might find something new and useful here. **My intention is to provide reliable information for those with an open mind to this important phenomenon.** I want to acknowledge that I am no expert on QAnon. I have watched several videos both pro and con, read a number of articles, and consult with a key Harvard graduate friend who believes there is something valuable to it. I would guestimate I've spent around a dozen hours investigating QAnon, where some Q followers have spent many hundreds of hours diving into this material. That said, I have spent many thousands of hours investigating the deep state and how it works. Given this, I have no hesitation in explaining how I suspect the QAnon movement has been infiltrated. **For those with limited time, I'll give the quick down and dirty. Though I've been intrigued, I've never been a Q follower nor a Q hater. I am deeply saddened by the way the Q movement is creating more polarization in our world which just feeds the us vs. them paradigm that has been at the root of so many of our world's problems. That said, I find Q to be unveiling some very important previously hidden truths, especially around [child sex trafficking](https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabusescandalsnewsarticles), [mind control](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse), and the [secretive groups and cults](https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/cults-child-sex-abuse) involved, though the facts have often been skewed and exaggerated.** These are vitally important topics which I have been researching and reporting on for almost 20 years. They are a key focus of my work on the website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), which has now received well over 20 million visits. Very few have been willing to look into the solid, verifiable evidence of these darkest aspects of humanity which, by the way, I believe exist in some form in every one of us, myself included. I believe these key topics are the most important challenges facing our world. I am deeply dedicated to helping stop the sexual abuse and killing of children for profit (yes, snuff films are real and are huge money makers), especially when it is organized by nefarious groups and cults around the world who use it to blackmail politicians, business leaders, and more.

I'm most thankful to Q for exposing these sad truths. I know that if everyone were aware of how the institutions of government, business, and more have been corrupted by child sex trafficking groups, this tragic situation would change overnight. Yet few are willing to explore these disturbing depths. Jeffrey Epstein is just the tip of the iceberg on this. For an example of the solid, verifiable information I've put together on this, [see the eye-opening documentary \"Imperium\"](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/child-trafficking-documentary) and the undeniable evidence supporting it. Or watch the suppressed documentary \"[Conspiracy of Silence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).\" Both of these were made before Q came on the scene. Or read [this chapter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#13) of the incredible book *Lifting the Veil*. **I have no doubt the problem is much more serious than most people would imagine, yet I also believe it is not as severe as Q makes it out to be. ** **Because of the strong polarizing element and far too much exaggeration, misleading claims, and more, I cannot support the Q movement. Neither can I support a movement which believes Trump is our savior who will expose the deep state, save the trafficked children, and throw all of the perpetrators in jail. Once elected, Trump quickly [surrounded himself with Wall Street bankers](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-trump-cabinet-billionaires-wall-street-20161201-story.html) for advisors, in effect filling the swamp rather than draining it.

I will go into more detail on these later. **History of Q** For those unaware of the history of Q, I quote a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/53498434) which I find accurate on this: \"In October 2017, an anonymous user put a series of posts on the message board 4chan. The user signed off as 'Q' and claimed to have a level of US security approval known as 'Q clearance'. These messages became known as 'Q drops' or 'breadcrumbs', often written in cryptic language peppered with slogans, pledges and pro-Trump themes.\" **Q is suspected by followers to be either an individual or a group in the U.S. government with a very high level of security clearance and in close communication with Trump.

Billions are spent to manipulate public opinion and forward secret agendas. With that kind of money, do you think those in the deep state have not infiltrated the Q movement to radicalize and thus discredit it? [Deep state actors want us polarized](https://www.wanttoknow.info/070707newparadigm), as that is what makes it easier to manipulate us and keep our attention focused on the left/right split and away from the 0.01% which manipulates from above. **If we continue fighting against \"them\" (whoever your chosen enemy may be), we are just perpetuating more of the same [war-obsessed cycle](https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket) that has ruled large portions of this world for millennia.** I am a stand for moving beyond polarization and recognizing the inherent divinity at the core of all beings. I'm doing all that I can to expose and stop destructive behavior in our world while simultaneously doing my best to understand the underlying reasons which drive some to commit these crimes and to works towards rectifying these serious core issues. And I am not looking for a savior of our world, whether it be Donald Trump, as Q posits, or the ET mothership so many believe is coming. I believe that it's up to each of us to save ourselves from the fear and polarization which is at the root of so many of our world's problems. I've found claims by Q followers that Donald Trump has greatly increased arrests of child traffickers to be unfounded, as revealed by [official White House statistics](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/12/viral-image/graph-showing-rising-human-trafficking-arrests-und/). He has made clear numerous times that this is a priority for him, yet the statistics show not much difference between arrests made during his administration compared to the previous one. Still, I want to say thank you, whoever you are, Q, for awakening so many to this great scourge.

Though I have no desire to push you into believing me or what I say about this, I invite you to not fall into the polarization game. Do your own research on which parts of the QAnon phenomenon might be valid and which are not, and consider challenging yourself if you are falling into the us vs them trap around this. **Life is not black and white, folks. The more we recognize that we're all in this together and that the deepest power lies within, the more quickly I suspect we will be able to enjoy life on this beautiful planet and to grow and have deeper, more fulfilling relationships with ourselves and with all around us.** **A Deeper Perspective** There is so much misinformation and disinformation out there that it can be very challenging to figure out what's really going on. **I have no doubt that [certain powerful groups](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) are fanning the flames of chaos by putting out F.E.A.R. (false evidence appearing real) that is meant to polarize us.** We know that deep state agents are using [thousands of fake facebook and twitter accounts](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-fresh-cambridge-analytica-leak-shows-global-manipulation-out-control) to manipulate public opinion. And peaceful movements are being [infiltrated by agent provocateurs](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--short-history-us-law-enforcement-infiltrating-protests) who incite violence in order to turn public opinion against the movement. With all the confusion and chaos we are currently experiencing, I suspect that - possibly more than ever before - what we see and experience is being influenced by the conscious and unconscious beliefs and biases which filter and distort our perception. **Those like QAnon followers who have a conspiracy filter are seeing conspiracy everywhere, while those who have a fear-of-disease filter are finding a plethora of reasons to live in fear and trust the official story being put out by the government and media.** Especially in these challenging times, it's so important to examine and questions our own biases and beliefs. I'm aware that this applies to me, too. I'm doing my best to recognize my own filters and see things for what they are. And it ain't easy. Regarding Q, I know there is valuable information to be gained, but I also am concerned that it may be causing more problems as it is helping to solve. **Problems with the QAnon Movement** One of my major concerns from the beginning has been how Q and Q followers believe Trump literally is a savior who behind the scenes is working to expose the deep state and to rescue the trafficked children.

I am amazed at how so many Q followers see Trump as our savior and dismiss any faults in him. Many claim his brash and narcissistic behavior is a front necessary to do what needs to be done behind the scenes.

It suggests that we're all in this together. Yet if you explore the literature of the movement, it is incredibly polarizing. Though in the early days of the Q movement, I saw the Bushes and many [Republicans included in claims of child trafficking](https://www.wanttoknow.info/890629washingtontimesfranklin), more recently the movement has focused on demonizing Democrats and the Black Lives Matter movement. How is that in alignment with WWG1WGA. **Is it possible that infiltrators have pushed the movement to polarize like this?** **The Gap** How is it that so many who once believed the official government story on these matters so quickly convert to become avid Q followers, as happened to a wonderful friend of mine. I suspect the key reason is the huge gulf or gap between what the media and government project as reality and the very different reality those of us who have taken the time to do serious research have uncovered. **Because of this large gap, those who first discover the reliable, verifiable reports about [major cover-ups around UFOs](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up), [mind control](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse), [health](https://www.wanttoknow.info/deception10pg), and more, are often astounded and dumbfounded.** It's like Alice going down the rabbit hole or taking the red pill in the film \"The Matrix.\" Once they've opened to this new reality, they are very vulnerable and open.

Subscribers to the [WantToKnow.info email list](https://www.wanttoknow.info/subscribe.php) that I manage know that the major media and government have either censored or underreported many huge, major cover-ups on a wide range of topics. [WantToKnow.info](https://WantToKnow.info) specializes in using reliable sources to verify everything stated about these cover-ups. I've been one of the few on the Internet to report on major cover-ups and conspiracies, yet not fall into the trap of seeing conspiracy everywhere. So many conspiracy websites sell fear and sensationalism focused on the evil cabal which is out to destroy us. Some of what they report is real and vital information, but as it is mixed with easily disproven or greatly exaggerated information, all of their work is then debunked, as in the case of QAnon. This tends to discredit even those who are doing solid, serious research on cover-ups. **Controlling factions of the power elite take advantage of this and spend lots of money to infiltrate and radicalize conspiracy movements.** These infiltrators put out real information that is new and verifiable which convinces people they are trustworthy. Yet they eventually put out exaggerated and even outrageous claims which are not real, but most fall for it and don't do the research needed to show it is disinformation. We need more researchers like [Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/), [Glenn Greenwald](https://theintercept.com/staff/glenn-greenwald/), [Catherine Austin Fitts](https://www.wanttoknow.info/banking_finance/trillions-missing-catherine-austin-fitts), and myself who have a careful, critical eye. They don't fall for these tactics and walk the line between official government stories and crazy, exaggerated conspiracy theories. **What I've learned from QAnon** All that said, I have learned some valuable new information from QAnon and the movement. I've found a number of facts about child trafficking groups of which I was not aware that I was able to verify using reliable sources. I compile these vetted facts and report them on WantToKnow.info and to our email list. Other things I learned were even more intriguing. **The most astounding information I have learned involved Donald Trump's uncle John. ** Did you know that [John Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Trump) was an MIT professor and highly respected scientist whose patented inventions earned him the National Medal of Science, as reported in his [*New York Times*obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/26/us/john-trump-dies-engineer-was-78.html)? The [*New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trumps-nuclear-uncle) describes Trump's uncle as a \"brilliant scientist\" who \"was at M.I.T. for decades\" and who helped develop X-ray machines that extended the lives of countless cancer patients. Did you know that according to [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44457471), \"when legendary physicist Nikola Tesla died in 1943, Prof. Trump was asked by the FBI to examine Tesla's papers", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons.txt:5:a30dff10180a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10311, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "professor and highly respected scientist whose patented inventions earned him the National Medal of Science, as reported in his [*New York Times*obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/26/us/john-trump-dies-engineer-was-78.html)?

Though I have reported on it very little as I don't have enough evidence that is verifiable, I'm fairly certain that [Tesla was involved in time travel experiments](https://www.gaia.com/article/has-the-government-already-achieved-time-travel). This may sound crazy to some, but I have met and spent several hours interviewing two credible individuals who claim to have been involved in secret government time travel programs, one of whom told me in great detail about Tesla's involvement in creating them. I've also researched several respected groups who I'm convinced have developed some form of time travel. So is it possible John Trump had access to some of Tesla's time travel experiments? Learn more about John Trump in [this interesting article](https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/john-trump-donald-uncle-mit-nikola-tesla-g-george-time-travel/). **Through QAnon materials I explored, I learned about John Trump and about a [2017*Newsweek*article](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284) titled, \"Did an Author From the 1800s Predict the Trumps, Russia and America's Downfall?\"** The article reports on two books written in the late 1800s by [Ingersoll Lockwood](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ingersoll+lockwood&i=stripbooks) about a boy named Baron Trump from a wealthy family who travels to Russia on an adventure that shapes the rest of his life. He is guided by a master named \"Don.\" Lockwood's final novel in 1896 was titled \"[The Last President](https://www.amazon.com/1900-Last-President-Ingersoll-Lockwood/dp/1548980315/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_1).\" To quote the *Newsweek* article on this novel: \"The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a \"state of uproar\" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate. Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years. 'The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,' the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. Some Americans begin forming a resistance, protesting what was seen as a corrupt and unethical election process.\" Isn't it strange that this book gives the address of the Trump Tower as the site of the protest when the Trump Tower wasn't built until many decades later? And is it beyond belief that the resistance formed in the book could have been foretelling the QAnon movement? This is what the movement claims. Could it be, as many Q followers claim, that John Trump was involved with time travel experiments and invited his nephew to do this with him?

I know this all may seem impossible to believe, but if you knew everything I did about time travel projects and the secret groups involved, you would likely understand why I was stunned to find this fascinating information. And I acknowledge that the time travel angle is quite speculative and very difficult to verify. **The truth is nuanced** **The intriguing time travel angle and other valuable information I found along with the exposure of child sex trafficking rings which lead to the highest levels leave me feeling grateful for some of the material QAnon has exposed. Yet I also strongly oppose the intense polarization, the focus on good vs evil, the glorification of Donald Trump, and the misleading exaggerations and sloppy research that characterizes most QAnon followers and the movement. Like so many controversial matters, I find there are important truths on both sides of the controversy. ** The major media consistently slam QAnon and sometimes go so far as to state there is nothing true or valuable there. I have no doubt that this causes many who choose to seriously investigate the phenomenon to be more likely to swallow the red pill and even to swing from being a debunker to an avid follower. If the media were to give more balanced reporting, people could make more rational, informed evaluations and would be less likely to polarize around the issue. Sadly, the media appears to be getting more polarized with every passing year. Where are the neutral journalists who can present both sides of the story and invite us to investigate further ourselves? I invite you to notice how much you are polarized either for or against QAnon and check if you might be open to a more nuanced view of this and of all matters around which so many are polarized. I invite you to open to higher or inner guidance as you do this and ask to be led to whatever best serves you and all of us in your investigations. **By moving beyond polarization, questioning our filters, and choosing to open to and explore the various aspects of QAnon and of all things polarized, we can contribute to building a more peaceful and compassionate world. ** With best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) Former [White House interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) and [whistleblower](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/q-qanon-movement-pros-cons&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/q-qanon-movement-pros-cons&title=) **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons.txt:7:48ea86657147", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10313, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__q-qanon-movement-pros-cons", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "best serves you and all of us in your investigations. **By moving beyond polarization, questioning our filters, and choosing to open to and explore the various aspects of QAnon and of all things polarized, we can contribute to building a more peaceful and compassionate world. ** With best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) Former [White House interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) and [whistleblower](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/q-qanon-movement-pros-cons&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/q-qanon-movement-pros-cons&title=) **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

During a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., seven former Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said [Robert Salas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine a light on our nuclear weapons and just send us a message,\" he said. \"My interpretation is the message is get rid of them because it's going to mean our destruction.\"** Other former officers recounted similar stories of unexplained moving lights and odd-shaped flying objects during their time in the service.

She spent the last 10 years researching UFOs and combing through thousands of pages of declassified government material. Kean said that one declassified document that she researched for her book, relating to the Salas incident, said, \"the fact that no apparent reason for the loss of the 10 missiles can easily be identified is a cause for grave concern to this headquarters.\" **Note:** To watch 18-minutes of this most fascinating testimony on the CNN website, [click here](http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/27/5189195-aliens-have-landed-in-the-headlines).

The boy knew details about airplanes and about pilot James Huston Jr. that he couldn't have known. James' parents say he also had terrible nightmares about a plane crashing and a \"little man\" unable to get out. James, now 8, stills loves airplanes, but he is free of those haunting images of the pilot's death. Jim Tucker, a child psychiatrist and medical director of the Child and Family Psychiatric Clinic at the University of Virginia, is one of the few researchers to extensively study the phenomenon of children who seem to have memories of past lives. He says James' case is very much like others he has studied. **\"At the University of Virginia, we've studied over 2,500 cases of children who seem to talk about previous lives when they're little,\" Tucker said. \"They start at 2 or 3, and by the time they're 6 or 7 they forget all about it and go on to live the rest of their lives.\"** Tucker -- the author of [*Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives*](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Before-Childrens-Memories-Previous/dp/031237674X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290277409&sr=1-3) -- has seen cases", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__question_authority_question_reality.txt:3:5adbcb72a8cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10318, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__question_authority_question_reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__question_authority_question_reality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "much like others he has studied. **\"At the University of Virginia, we've studied over 2,500 cases of children who seem to talk about previous lives when they're little,\" Tucker said. \"They start at 2 or 3, and by the time they're 6 or 7 they forget all about it and go on to live the rest of their lives.\"** Tucker -- the author of [*Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives*](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Before-Childrens-Memories-Previous/dp/031237674X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290277409&sr=1-3) -- has seen cases like James' where children make statements that can be verified and seem to match with a particular person. \"It means that this is a phenomenon that really needs to be explored,\" Tucker said. \"James is one of many, many kids who have said things like this.\" While about three-fourths of Americans say they believe in paranormal activity, 20 percent believe in reincarnation, according to a 2005 Gallup poll. **Note:** To watch the engaging ABC News video clip of this incredible story, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/reincarnation_evidence_abc_boy_pilot_wwii).

Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres (120 feet) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old. **The vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years.** Debris recovered from the site - including construction material, pottery, sections of walls, beads, sculpture and human bones and teeth has been carbon dated and found to be nearly 9,500 years old. The city is believed to be even older than the ancient Harappan civilisation, which dates back around 4,000 years. Author and film-maker Graham Hancock - who has written extensively on the uncovering of ancient civilisations [said,] \"Cities on this scale are not known in the archaeological record until roughly 4,500 years ago when the first big cities begin to appear in Mesopotamia. Nothing else on the scale of the underwater cities of Cambay is known. **There's a huge chronological problem in this discovery. It means that the whole model of the origins of civilisation with which archaeologists have been working will have to be remade from scratch,\"** he said. **Note:** Dozens of manmade complexes found under the ocean have been found, yet mainstream archeologists are largely ignoring these finds because they don't fit the academic consensus.

A letter from an unnamed C.I.A. official in 1949 discussed ways of killing people without leaving a trace. \"I believe that there are two chemical substances which would be most useful in that they would leave no characteristic pathological findings,\" the letter said. In 1952, two Russian agents who were \"suspected of being doubled\" were interrogated using \"narcohypnotic\" methods. The two men were given sodium pentothal and a stimulant. One interrogation produced a \"remarkable\" regression, the papers said, during which \"the subject actually relived certain past activities of his life. The subject totally accepted Mr. [name deleted] as an old and trusted and beloved personal friend whom the subject had known in years past in Georgia, U.S.S.R.\" The C.I.A. conducted secret medical experiments from 1949 through 1963 under the code names Bluebird, Artichoke, MK Ultra and MK Delta. **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/770721nytimes.ciahumanbehaviorcontrol).

There are no tracks or bloodstains. It's been happening, off and on, for decades. Manuel A. Sanchez has ruled out every logical explanation for the fate that has befallen the calves on his ranch in southern Colorado. Over the past month, he's found four calves dead in a way that he cannot reconcile with anything in his 50 years of raising cattle: eyes and ears missing, tongues and genitals excised in what appeared to be a series of fine cuts. Mountain lions, bears or coyotes would leave messier marks, he said. And Sanchez found no tire tracks or footprints that would suggest a human invader -- nor even bloodstains he'd expect to find around the carcasses if someone had butchered them. It's not the first time. In the 1970s, ranchers in eastern and southern Colorado filed more than 200 mutilation reports, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigation reports. The agency investigated, even conducting an undercover operation, but to no avail. **\"It was such a bewilderment,\" recalled Tillie Bishop, a state senator at the time. Some people suspected satanic cults. Others grew convinced of an otherworldly explanation -- space aliens.** In the mid-1990s, 27 cattle in northern New Mexico were mutilated in 16 months, the Associated Press reported.

To even raise the question amid all the officially inspired hysteria is heretical. Yet a brilliant new BBC film produced by one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers systematically challenges this. \"The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear\" ... argues coherently that much of what we have been told about the threat of international terrorism \"is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned ... around the world.\" Why have we heard so much frightening talk about \"dirty bombs\" when experts say it is panic rather than radioactivity that would kill people? Why did Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claim on \"Meet the Press\" in 2001 that Al Qaeda controlled massive high-tech cave complexes in Afghanistan, when British and U.S. military forces later found no such thing? **The film ... directly challenges the conventional wisdom by making a powerful case that the Bush administration, led by a tight-knit cabal of Machiavellian neoconservatives, has seized upon the false image of a unified international terrorist threat to replace the expired Soviet empire in order to push a political agenda.** \"The nightmare vision of a uniquely powerful hidden organization waiting to strike our societies is an illusion. Wherever one looks for this Al Qaeda organization, from the mountains of Afghanistan to the 'sleeper cells' in America, the British and Americans are chasing a phantom enemy.\" **Note:** If above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050111latimes).

Or so the conspiracy theory goes. The theory that has developed on the web since 9/11 is that US intelligence services are manufacturing the Bin Laden statements ... to justify the so-called war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq and back at home. Numerous audio and video statements purporting to be from Bin Laden have been released, but their authenticity has been continually questioned. The veracity of all of the videos is questioned by David Ray Griffin, a former theology professor and member of the 9/11 Truth Movement, which also questions mainstream accounts of the attack on the World Trade Centre. **\"None of them can be proven to be authentic,\" he says. \"At least three of them can be shown to be almost certainly fake. And if somebody is faking Bin Laden videos, then that leads to the suspicion that all the videos and audio tapes have been faked.\"** His first example is a video released by the US Department of Defense in December 2001. In it, [the] Bin Laden [figure] confesses to 9/11, yet Mr Griffin points out that al-Qaeda has only rarely admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks. He also maintains that the Bin Laden figure looks very different to previous footage - fatter, with shorter fingers, and that he is even writing with the wrong hand. **Note:** To see how easily audio and video materials can be faked, read excerpts from [this Washington Post article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-when-seeing-hearing-isnt-believing).

While its exact range is classified, Doug Beason, an expert in directed-energy weapons, puts it at about 700 meters, and the beam cannot penetrate a number of materials, such as aluminum.

Their one goal was to see how far they can get these amazing machines to travel on a minuscule amount of fuel. While we might be delirious if we managed 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the gallon (4.5 litres) pottering about town in our super minis, these people are not happy until they have seen the mileometer click through the thousands. The teams have a choice of petrol or diesel, with solar assistance permitted for the first time this year. A car is allowed three 40-minute runs. It must average at least 15 mph (24 kph) after which the stewards at the meeting calculate the machine's fuel efficiency. \"The top fuel teams do about 10 miles, which is six laps on the club circuit at Silverstone,\" says the event's fuel manager Geoff Houlbrook. \"They do that on less than 10 millilitres which is just two teaspoons of fuel.\" The entries come from all over Europe.

For a decade, Kenneth Ring, a psychology professor and researcher at the University of Connecticut, has looked into the question through the near-death experiences of others. Mr. Ring ... talked with hundreds of people between the ages of 18 and 84 who have come close to physical death. [His books] *[Life at Death](http://www.amazon.com/Life-at-Death-Kenneth-Ring/dp/0688012531/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195750137&sr=1-1)* [and] *[Heading Toward Omega](http://www.amazon.com/Heading-Toward-Omega-Kenneth-Ring/dp/0688062687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195750664&sr=1-1)* both deal with near-death experiences and how they change people's lives. A near-death experience ... often happens to individuals who find themselves on the verge of imminent biological death. It involves ... a sense of the most profound peace and well-being that is possible to imagine. It's a sense of being separate from the physical body and sometimes being able to see it as though a spectator off to one side or from up above. These people have a sense of moving through a dark space or tunnel toward a radiantly beautiful white or golden light. They are absorbed in that light, having in some cases a panoramic life review in which virtually everything that they've ever done in their life they're able to see; perhaps meeting the spirits of deceased love ones or friends. And in some cases, they are asked to make a decision as to whether they would like to continue or go back to their body. The most powerful antidote to the fear of death is coming close to death ... and remembering one of these experiences.** After having a near-death experience, people believe the end of life isn't [the end]; they believe in some sort of life after", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__question_authority_question_reality.txt:12:52912fcffce4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10327, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__question_authority_question_reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__question_authority_question_reality", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "to see; perhaps meeting the spirits of deceased love ones or friends.

What is most fascinating and rarely discussed isn't his stance on civil rights, but his willingness to speak out about the crimes and atrocities committed by covert elements within the US government. Below, we discuss nefarious efforts by the US intelligence, military, and law enforcement machinery to harass, blackmail, discredit, and spy on Dr. King. We also reveal undeniable evidence connecting these abuses of power to his tragic assassination on April 4, 1968. **Few people know about the 1999 King Family civil trial in Memphis, where it took a jury only one hour to determine that the US government was behind the [assassination of King](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/martin-luther-king-trial-government-guilty). ** In sharing this important and little-known information, we draw upon the powerful words and experience of journalist and human rights lawyer Dr. William Pepper in his book [*The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr*](https://www.amazon.com/Plot-Kill-King-Behind-Assassination/dp/1536682195). Pepper was a personal friend to King and the attorney for the King Family. He also represented King's alleged murderer James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan in the trial for the murder of Robert Kennedy. While the information presented here is deeply unsettling, we honor the powerful vision and faith in human goodness that shaped King's activism. Heavily influenced by the nonviolent teachings of Mahatma Gandhi who he saw as a \"guiding light,\" King believed that truth and peace are inseparable. **Truth is rooted in a refusal to do harm with our words and actions, and a personal readiness to suffer for it. **He believed that death and destruction imposed on others, no matter who they are, was an injury to all other human beings. After grieving over photographs of slaughtered Vietnamese children and the destructive use of napalm and white phosphorus on innocent Vietnamese people, he resolved to call passionate attention to harmful US war agendas in every corner of America he visited. *I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway of destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future.

I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor. * ***I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government**. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.* *For those who ask the question, \"Aren't you a civil rights leader?\" and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: **\"To save the soul of America.\"** We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear.* - Dr. King, \"*Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence*,\" 1967 In the last year of his life, Dr. King had plans to move into mainstream politics as a [presidential candidate with pediatrician and anti-war activist Dr. Benjamin Spock](https://www.carolinajournal.com/how-a-nc-professor-almost-built-a-king-spock-presidential-ticket/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Spock%2C%20the%20two%20never,interventionism%20and%20promote%20democratic%20socialism.).

The focus was to bring people together nationwide, highlighting the importance of an anti-poverty and anti-war agenda that would radically shift American society from a \"thing-oriented society\" powered by weapons and machines to a person-oriented society born out of freedom and equality. King dreamed of a global society of peace and cooperation, where the forces and conditions that give rise to war would be eliminated. **He envisioned a movement that would activate a deeper consciousness in activism and politics. **His position on war was a natural extension of the civil rights struggle against oppression and inequality. As King once said, \"*A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom*.\" The hefty cost of the war required that essential social services and programs in American communities be cut, disproportionately impacting low-income people and communities of color. In addressing freedom and inequality, he began passionately organizing the Poor People's Campaign project, which would involve a tent city of hundreds of thousands of America's most marginalized and underserved communities at the Washington Monument. They would remain for as long as it took Congress to take action on restoring social welfare programs. King's actions attracted negative attention from powerful interests. They were threatened by his unifying and empowering message. These entities consisted of oil companies, military contractors and multinational banks that all profited lavishly from the war machine and economic inequality. *When one assesses the awesome array of privately established, nongovernmental, institutional power, it is eminently reasonable to consider those in government decision-making positions as being compelled to listen to, protect, and serve the unified interest of this corporate establishment. * **When business speaks with one voice, as it did in respect to the war or the purported extreme threat of war, at the time when Dr. King set himself up in opposition, the relevant government agencies and their officials became mere foot soldiers for the mighty economic interests. ** Out in front during war are the armed forces and the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Not far behind are the executive, the legislative, and the judicial legitimizers, who sanction the necessary action. Following in line are the media conglomerates, who as the publicists of government policy, though posing as independent voices of the people, vigorously support and defend the official policy in those serious national security instances of significant concern to the corporate establishment. - Dr. Pepper, excerpt from *Plot To Kill King* Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and official documents from the House Select Committee report on his assassination revealed a coordinated effort within law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies to tarnish King's reputation as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt:2:b866bd4d8057", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10331, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the media conglomerates, who as the publicists of government policy, though posing as independent voices of the people, vigorously support and defend the official policy in those serious national security instances of significant concern to the corporate establishment. - Dr. Pepper, excerpt from *Plot To Kill King* Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and official documents from the House Select Committee report on his assassination revealed a coordinated effort within law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies to tarnish King's reputation as a civil rights activist.

Even the intelligence branch of the United States Army [spied on King and his family](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html) for three generations. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Center for National Security Studies exposed a little-known CIA division known as the Office of Security (OS), which focused heavily on Dr. King during the 60s and had a strong working relationship with Hoover of the FBI.

Yet [questions lingered](https://compactmag.com/article/did-the-fbi-kill-mlk), especially when Ray [filed a motion to withdraw his plea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/30/who-killed-martin-luther-king-jr-his-family-believes-james-earl-ray-was-framed/) days after his sentence, claiming he had been framed by his attorney and the FBI. Ray never had a fair trial, and Pepper was convinced of Ray's innocence. He continued to investigate the case even after Ray died. In 1999, Pepper and the King family filed a civil action in Memphis against a man who admitted he was involved: Loyd Jowers, owner of a restaurant near where King was assassinated. Jowers would later admit to being part of the conspiracy to kill King, and he would be found responsible for the killing, along with various government agencies. *The King v. Jowers civil trial ... went on for 30 days with some 70 witnesses. It was not covered by the media. Because of the degree of media control in matters of this sort, very few people know that trial took place. But it did. **And it took a jury 59 minutes to find that James Earl Ray had no involvement, knowing involvement, in the killing.**\"* - Excerpt from [an interview with Dr. Pepper](https://archives.kpfa.org/data/20170407-Fri1300.mp3) on [The Project Censored Radio Show](https://www.projectcensored.org/radio/) **Pepper's compelling investigation points to a conspiracy to silence King's growing criticism of the Vietnam War and his anti-poverty campaign by Hoover, elements within the military and intelligence agencies, the Memphis Police Department, and Mafia crime figures.** As revealed in a [transcript of an ABC News PrimeTime Live program interview](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol10.html#p1380\" target=) with Jowers, which was read to the jury in the Memphis courtroom, Jowers admitted that Ray did not kill King and that he was involved in a conspiracy. **Jowers alleged the gunman was a Memphis police officer who fired from the bushes behind the grill,** then handed Jowers the murder weapon. Jowers stashed the rifle behind the bar and said it was later picked up by Raul and tossed in the Mississippi River. **Leading up to King's assassination, Jowers revealed that a man asked him to help in King's murder, who was a Mafia-connected produce dealer named Frank Liberto.** [Liberto had a courier deliver $100,000](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol10.html#p1382) for Jowers to hold at his restaurant.

The day before the murder, Jowers was visited by a man named Raul, who brought a rifle in a box. Betty Spates, a waitress at his grill and girlfriend of Jowers, corroborated his story. In the civil trial, she testified that he had been delivered a large sum of money right before the assassination. **Seconds after the gunshots, she saw him rush into the back of the Grill through the back door, which he then wrapped in a tablecloth and hid on a shelf under the counter. He turned to her and said, \"Betty, you wouldn't do anything to hurt me, would you?\"** She responded, \"Of course not, Loyd.\" Testimonials from countless witnesses including King's driver and New York Times reporter Earl Caldwell described seeing the shot come from the bushes and not from the bathroom of the rooming house as the official story states. A witness testified that she heard a fireman announce to the police that \"The shot came from that clump of bushes,\" indicating the heavily overgrown brushy area facing the Lorraine and adjacent to Fire Station 2. **The next morning, Memphis public works employees cut down the bushes and destroyed a \"possible crime scene.\"** Usual special body guards provided by the Memphis police were advised they \"weren't needed\" on the day of the assassination. **Dr. King's room was also changed from a secure 1st-floor room to an exposed balcony room.** Along with sanitizing a crime scene, police abandoned the standard investigative procedure of interviewing witnesses who lived by the scene of the shooting. [Testimony by ballistics expert and Criminal Court Judge Joe Brown](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#JBB\" target=) established that **the rifle in evidence was not the murder weapon, as it did not match to the bullet that killed King**. Ballistics tests could not prove that the rifle, a Remington .30-06 Gamemaster, either did or didn't fire the fatal shot. *[King] was shot from the bushes in the back of the rooming house by a Memphis police department sharp shooter. He was hit in the face and went down and lost consciousness. **He was, however, alive.*** *He was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital. He was in the emergency room.

Warren and Murphy were both active in covert Special Operation Group (SOG) missions in Vietnam. Throughout 1967, they were involved in the highly secretive [902nd Military Intelligence Group (MIG) operations](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html#902), which was run by Colonel John Downie, Lyndon Johnson's former Vietnam briefer. As members of small \"Alpha team\" units for the 902nd MIG, Murphy and Warren were deployed in cities where violence was breaking out. **They were issued photographs and personal information of black radical activists who were designated as targets to be \"taken out\" if a disruption or riot broke out. ** Warren and Murphy would then be a part of a Memphis Special Forces training team in civilian disguise, positioned to shoot King on top of the nearby Illinois Central Railroad Building. The two men told Pepper that their commander's \"pep talk\" involved showing pictures of King and Reverend Andrew Young, who was with King in Memphis. **It was stressed to Warren and Murphy that these men were enemies of the US and had plans to bring down the government, which would result in catastrophic results for cities if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" target=) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam%E2%80%99s_secret_wars\" target=)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt:7:4ab4f3d6e2f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10336, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" target=) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam%E2%80%99s_secret_wars\" target=)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice of infiltrating and spying on US activist groups, finding that [their surveillance](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3019&context=ilj&httpsredir=1&referer=) was both \"unauthorized and in violation of the first amendment.\" ** In 1996, Tompkins received a phone call from Downie, who found Pepper's research on the King assassination in his first book [*Orders to Kill*](https://www.amazon.com/Orders-Kill-Behind-Murder-Martin/dp/1483047415#:~:text=After%20eighteen%20years%20of%20intensive,nation's%20greatest%20civil%20rights%20leader.) \"remarkably accurate,\" yet felt that he gave Downie too much responsibility for the operation. Downie described himself as \"an officer in a chain of command following orders.\" Downie, refusing to meet with Pepper, agreed to meet with Tompkins. Downie confirmed he played a key role in coordinating the military units in Memphis during the week leading up to and on King's assassination. He also admitted that Ray was used as a \"patsy\" in various covert operations. By the summer of 1997, Downie had disappeared. *We learned that the 902nd MIG was involved in a clandestine joint venture operation with Carlos Marcello's Mafia family, whereby stolen weapons from US military bases, camps, and arsenals were delivered to Marcello's property, loaded onto barges, and shipped to the Gulf at Houston, where they were off-loaded, repackaged, and sold to right-wing forces in Latin and South America. **The profits were split 50-50 between the 902nd and the mob, with the 902nd using the profits to fund further black operations. This particular operation, the assassination of Dr. King, was not only confirmed by two members of the Alpha 184 sniper team,** who were themselves drivers at various times, but also independently corroborated by Glenda Grabow, who was a friend of the Houston operatives and present at some of the unloading activity led by Raul. Thus, she personally observed the Houston side of the enterprise.* - Excerpt from *Plot to Kill King* **King's Legacy** Many questions exist on the nature of the money, players, and motives behind the King assassination. Despite this unfortunate reality, King remains a powerful moral voice for our times in the wake of the endless US war machine that continues to fuel conflict and destruction worldwide. *Now, what kind of man was he? A man of enormous courage. No matter how much money it cost him, no matter how much his life became increasingly in danger, he stood firm on behalf of values, that he thought were essential human values. And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in fact, unconscionable. So, he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt:8:36219b985bca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10337, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__real-story-behind-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "endless US war machine that continues to fuel conflict and destruction worldwide. *Now, what kind of man was he?

And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in fact, unconscionable. So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy.* - Dr. Pepper There are many reasons for grief, confusion, and rage. King wrote about these related concerns in his final book *[Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos Or Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F)*. He asserted that humankind has the resources and technology to overcome oppression and corruption. King frequently spoke about the Greek concept of agape, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. Agape is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all.\" It is the willingness to go to any length to restore community. King felt that this is our best hope for a durable future that can outlast the harms and abuses in our world. In *Chaos or Community*, **he calls on the \"creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.\"** King deeply believed that the universe is on the side of justice. As a practitioner in nonviolence, he carried a deep faith in the future. His struggle for justice was accompanied by a cosmic, creative force integrating the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole. May we lead with the courage that King gracefully and fiercely role modeled for us, freeing ourselves from excessive fear and transforming \"us\" vs. \"them\" in thought and action as we work for the well-being of all. ***The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.*** - Dr. King Your financial support makes a difference.

Today, the legend is very much alive-and being added to. The Rothschilds are striking out in many new directions behind a silver curtain of discretion.

In one sense, of course, it is. But in another way it marks out the continuation of an even older tradition -** the ability of the family which has founded one of the world's largest private banking dynasties to sustain their secretive fortune, which industry insiders count not in billions but in trillions, and keep it within the family. Secrecy has been a hallmark of the Rothschilds from the outset. The Rothschilds created the world of banking as we know it today. **[They] invented, or at any rate popularised, the government bond, which allowed investors, big and small, to buy bits of the debts of sovereign states by purchasing fixed-interest bearer bonds.

RIT Capital Partners, which is chaired by Lord Rothschild, has taken a 37pc stake in Rockefeller Financial Services, the family's wealth advisory and asset management wing. It has snapped up the holding from French bank Société Générale for less than £100m. **The transatlantic alliance cements a five-decade acquaintance between the now ennobled Jacob Rothschild, 76, and David Rockefeller, 96, the grandson of the ruthlessly acquisitive American oilman and philanthropist John D Rockefeller.** The two patricians now plan to capitalise on their family names to buy other asset managers or their portfolios, using their networks of top-notch contacts to ensure they get a seat at the table for any deal. The Rockefeller group goes back to 1882, set up to invest the family money made by John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil, the forerunner for today's Exxon Corporation, which he built with a Darwinian aggression. \"Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure?

The move is part of Rothschild's plans to halt all commodities trading out of London as it becomes less profitable. Last year, the business generated just 2.2% of the bank's income, down from more than 8% five years earlier. **Rothschild's departure will leave a big gap, not least because it hosts the twice-daily gold price fixing. Started in 1919, it is a prized and bizarre tradition. Every day at 1030 and 1500 local time, five representatives of investment banks meet in a small room at Rothschild's London headquarters on St Swithin's Lane. They are charged by the London Gold Market to agree a price for the bullion on offer.** Each sits behind a desk and gets a phone and small Union Jack. In the centre is the chairperson, who for the past 85 years has come from Rothschild. A price is given and relayed via phone lines to customers. Then the haggling begins. When the price is right and buyers are matched with sellers, the flags are lowered and the price is fixed. While the whole process harks to a bygone age, the economics of the modern gold market are far less quaint. Many producers are no longer hedging their exposure to both currency and commodity price movements and that has taken a large chunk of business off the table. According to bank chairman David de Rothschild, \"our income from commodities trading in London has fallen as a percentage of our total income in each of the past five years\". **Note:** For more on commodity price rigging, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialnewsarticles). **Rothschilds to merge British and French banking operations to secure control** **2012-04-05, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9189053/Roths...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9189053/Rothschilds-to-merge-British-and-French-banking-operations-to-secure-control.html) The Rothschild dynasty is to merge its British and French banking operations to secure long-term control of the business and to boost the firm's financial strength ahead of the introduction of tougher capital requirements for banks. **The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__rothschild-family.txt:3:2890cacefe36", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10345, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__rothschild-family.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__rothschild-family", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "past five years\". **Note:** For more on commodity price rigging, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialnewsarticles). **Rothschilds to merge British and French banking operations to secure control** **2012-04-05, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9189053/Roths...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9189053/Rothschilds-to-merge-British-and-French-banking-operations-to-secure-control.html) The Rothschild dynasty is to merge its British and French banking operations to secure long-term control of the business and to boost the firm's financial strength ahead of the introduction of tougher capital requirements for banks. **The 200-year-old banks will be reunited under a single shareholding that will bring together the fortunes of the French and English sides of the renowned family as they attempt to safeguard the business against the effects of new regulation and the fallout from the global financial crisis.** Paris Orleans, the Rothschild Group's Paris-based holding company, will convert into a French limited partnership, securing the families' control of the bank against potential takeovers. The new partnership will then buy out minority investors in NM Rothschild & Sons, the UK business, as well as outstanding minority interests in the French operations. Paris Orleans has a market value of more than €500m (£415m) and is about 30pc owned by outside investors. The Rothschild Group employs 3,000 people in 42 countries and is one of the world's leading independent investment banks, advising some of the largest international companies on capital raisings and mergers and acquisitions. The bank also remains a player in the private equity industry and operates several merchant banking operations that invest directly in business across Europe and the rest of the world. **Note:** For an index of all articles ever published by the New York Times on the Rothschild family, [click here](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/rothschild_family/index.html).

Political donations from overseas are also illegal in the US, where John McCain's campaign team is under investigation for allegedly accepting a benefit in kind from two mega-rich British citizens, namely Nat Rothschild and his father, Jacob, the Fourth Baron Rothschild. In April, Mr McCain passed through London and spoke at a fund-raising dinner for expatriate Americans, where seats at the cheapest tables cost £500 a head. What caught the eye of Judicial Watch, a Washington-based foundation dedicated to combating corruption, was that the event was held \"by kind permission of Lord Rothschild and Hon Nathaniel Rothschild\" at the family home in Spencer House, St James's, the only privately owned 17th-century palace in central London. **The Rothschild family and politics have been intertwined for generations, ever since Nathan", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__rothschild-family.txt:4:9e4481cbf8da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10346, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__rothschild-family.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__rothschild-family", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "and spoke at a fund-raising dinner for expatriate Americans, where seats at the cheapest tables cost £500 a head.

When another member of the clan, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, married the New York businesswoman Lynn Forester, they spent the night of their wedding dinner in the White House as guests of Bill Clinton. Lady Rothschild was a fund-raiser for the Democrats.

In five short years, the man in line to be the fifth Baron Rothschild is close to becoming a billionaire. The ascent of Mr. Rothschild is a vivid illustration of how the still glittering, if somewhat faded, prestige and wealth of Europe's most storied banking family has been reinvigorated from bold bets in this era's new-money investment vehicles. Like his forebears, he prefers that his influence remain unseen. Mr. Rothschild is a principal adviser to Oleg Deripaska, one of the richest oligarchs in Russia and the owner of the aluminum giant Rusal, which recently merged with two other companies to create the world's largest aluminum company. Mr. Rothschild received no public credit despite having played a crucial role in getting the deal done. He ... would not be interviewed for this article, yet he allowed his lushly renovated town house in Greenwich Village to be featured in Men's Vogue magazine. With his mix of Old World politesse, a racy appreciation for fast times and the brute force of his accumulating wealth, **Mr. Rothschild has become friend and adviser to many - including Russian billionaires, Indian steel magnates and a long list of people who have helped him out during his ascent. \"There is a lot of power behind him, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__rothschild-family.txt:5:27a77f418f03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10347, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__rothschild-family.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__rothschild-family", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "this article, yet he allowed his lushly renovated town house in Greenwich Village to be featured in Men's Vogue magazine.

To give a taste: Lord Rothschild's son, Nat Rothschild, is a well-known entrepreneur with stakes in a range of companies such as Genel, the Kurdistan-focused oil producer ... and Bumi, the Indonesian mining group. He was also linked with George Osborne and Peter Mandelson at a notorious party on an oligarch's yacht off Corfu in 2008. Lord Rothschild's niece Kate is married to Ben Goldsmith, brother of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Jemima Khan and son of the late billionaire business tycoon Sir James Goldsmith. On the Rockefeller side, for starters, David's granddaughter Ariana is a successful fashion designer who married the construction heir Matthew Bucklin in 2010. The Rothschilds bought the stake in Rockefeller from French banking group Société Générale for an undisclosed sum. **Note:** For an index of all articles ever published by the New York Times on the Rothschild family, [click here](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/rothschild_family/index.html).

We may be taught little about money in our world, yet we are given even less healthy information about how to deal with sexuality in a sexually obsessed culture. For many people, sex is even more seductive than money. Our media, advertising, and entertainment industries are filled with subtle and not-so-subtle messages about sex. The underlying thrust is all about beauty, sexual desire, and how important it is to buy the products or operations which will make us popular, more attractive, and better lovers. And even though advertising and entertainment are filled with sexual innuendo, it is rare that you will find anything other than tabloids and women's magazines talking openly about both the joys and challenges of sex. In many communities, homes, and workplaces, serious discussion of sexuality continues to be a taboo subject. It is also extremely rare that any of society's many sexual messages even hints at sacred sexuality or the spiritual dimensions of sex. To those who have succumbed to all of these subliminal and overt messages, sacred sexuality might even seem like a contradiction in terms. Considering all of this, **how can we transform sexual energy in our lives and in our world to better support the good of all of us? ** Almost the opposite of societal conditioning, many of the world's religions imprint negative beliefs of sexuality in their followers. For thousands of years, these religions have considered sex to be a base and vulgar act. Sexuality gets little mention in the sacred texts of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. When it is mentioned, the suggestion is often to avoid it if possible in order to reach greater spiritual heights. Many monks and gurus also teach that we must refrain from sex in order to reach enlightenment. Yet none of us would be here without sex. There is virtually no spiritual instruction in how to deal with sexual urges other than to abstain. As a result, many people experience a split between sexuality and spirituality in their lives. For a powerful, yet deeply personal exploration of the sexual-spiritual split by a wonderful workshop facilitator", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__sacred-sexuality.txt:0:734d430ef0a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__sacred-sexuality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__sacred-sexuality", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "order to reach greater spiritual heights.

[**https://talksex.us/2016/09/sexual-spiritual-split**](https://talksex.us/2016/09/sexual-spiritual-split/) The exciting news is that, as shown in the above essay, old paradigm beliefs and attitudes around sexuality are clearly changing. Homosexuality, bisexuality, and other sexual persuasions are gradually gaining more acceptance and support, even in the media. Yet common misperceptions around all forms of sexuality continue to exist in many people and places, and very few have even considered the possibility that sexuality can be used to enhance spiritual growth. While fully honoring and supporting those who choose to abstain from sex for spiritual reasons, for those who choose to include sexuality in their spiritual path, it is important to be open and real in discussing this powerful force and how it can be used to change our lives and world. **The term [sacred sexuality](https://web.archive.org/web/20150216133318/http://psychologytomorrowmagazine.com/sexuality-sacred-sex/) is now being heard with increasing frequency in certain circles.** Please read the below eye-opening article showing how old attitudes are gradually changing. **[www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=931](http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=931) - Sacred Sex** Sacred sexuality is often associated with tantra - a spiritual practice in which sexuality is used to achieve higher spiritual states. Though tantric sexuality was developed in India thousands of years ago, it is recently becoming popular in certain pioneering groups in this modern age.

Walsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20190102214747/http://courtneyawalsh.com/) *The quintessential masculine is a flow outward from center. It courageously journeys forth, exploring the power of individuation and separation. The quintessential feminine is a flow inward towards center. It lovingly embraces the magic of union with All That Is. The creative masculine has become dominant over the surrendering feminine in the past several thousand years. Yet there is now a call for a return to balance between masculine and feminine. Let us help welcome the beauty of the feminine back into loving, dynamic balance. * Though open discussion of sexuality is still taboo in many groups and communities, this potentially transformative power is gradually becoming a part of our meaningful literature and even seeping into the mainstream through the progressive media. The below moving essay is a powerful example of the quality material now being published. The author reveals the painful, yet highly inspiring story of her sexual unfolding. Through the many trials and tribulations of her desperate search for love, she transforms from a young woman torn apart by her sexuality to eventually find that the ultimate love goes far beyond the ever-elusive knight in shining armor. **[https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/derosier.lovearchetypes](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/derosier.lovearchetypes) ** One of the purposes of this course is to really challenge you to be all that you can be.

First garlic lowers bad cholesterol, then-after more study-it doesn't. Hormone replacement reduces the risk of heart disease in postmenopausal women, until a huge study finds that it doesn't. But what if wrong answers aren't the exception but the rule? More and more scholars who scrutinize health research are now making that claim. **It isn't just an individual study here and there that's flawed, they charge. Instead, the very framework of medical investigation may be off-kilter, leading time and again to findings that are at best unproved and at worst dangerously wrong.** The result is a system that leads patients and physicians astray-spurring often costly regimens that won't help and may even harm you. Even a cursory glance at medical journals shows that once heralded studies keep falling by the wayside. A major study concluded there's no good evidence that statins (drugs like Lipitor and Crestor) help people with no history of heart disease. The study ... was based on an evaluation of 14 individual trials with 34,272 patients. Cost of statins: more than $20 billion per year. \"Positive\" drug trials, which find that a treatment is effective, and \"negative\" trials, in which a drug fails, take the same amount of time to conduct. But negative trials took an extra two to four years to be published. With billions of dollars on the line, companies are loath to declare a new drug ineffective. As a result of the lag in publishing negative studies, patients receive a treatment that is actually ineffective. From clinical trials of new drugs to cutting-edge genetics, biomedical research is riddled with incorrect findings. **Note:** For the good of your health, the entire article at the link above is well worth reading.

As recently as 1974 individual scientists and their financial backers could decide for themselves what constituted ethical research. Most of the time their judgment was sound, but there were plenty of appalling exceptions. **In the 1950s Army doctors gave LSD to soldiers without telling them what it was. In 1963 researchers injected prisoners and terminally ill patients with live cancer cells to test their immune responses; they were told only that it was a \"skin test.**\" In the 1950s mentally retarded children at Willowbrook, a state institution in New York, were deliberately infected with hepatitis so that scientists could work on an experimental vaccine. And in perhaps the most infamous case on record, doctors at Georgia's Tuskegee Institute, starting in the 1930s, deliberately withheld treatment from syphilis-infected African-American men for 40 years to monitor the course of the disease. Financial conflicts of interest can extend not only to the institutions but also to the researchers themselves. Jesse Gelsinger's death in the University of Pennsylvania's gene-therapy trial in 1999 seemed especially scandalous [because] James Wilson, the principal investigator in the study, held a 30% equity stake in Genovo, which owned the rights to license the drug Wilson was studying; the university owned 3.2% of the company. When Targeted Genetics Corp. acquired Genovo, Wilson reportedly earned $13.5 million and Penn $1.4 million. **Note:** For a powerful, reliable list of astounding incidents in which government and medical professionals used humans as guinea pigs over the past hundred years and continuing to the present, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/humanguineapigs).

But CBS News has found these three have something more in common - strong financial ties to the industry whose products they promote and defend. The vaccine industry gives millions to the Academy of Pediatrics for conferences, grants, medical education classes and even helped build their headquarters. The totals are kept secret, but public documents reveal bits and pieces. A $342,000 payment from Wyeth, maker of the pneumococcal vaccine - which makes $2 billion a year in sales. A $433,000 contribution from Merck, the same year the academy endorsed Merck's HPV vaccine - which made $1.5 billion a year in sales. Every Child By Two, a group that promotes early immunization for all children, admits the group takes money from the vaccine industry, too - but wouldn't tell us how much. **Then there's Paul Offit, perhaps the most widely-quoted defender of vaccine safety. He's gone so far as to say babies can tolerate \"10,000 vaccines at once.\"** **In fact, he's a vaccine industry insider. Offit holds in a $1.5 million dollar research chair at Children's Hospital, funded by Merck. He holds the patent on an anti-diarrhea vaccine he developed with Merck.

The meeting was triggered by the government's apology last fall for federal doctors infecting prisoners and mental patients in Guatemala with syphilis 65 years ago. U.S. officials also acknowledged there had been [dozens of similar experiments](http://www.wanttoknow.info/humanguineapigs) in the United States. Inevitably, they will be compared to the well-known Tuskegee syphilis study. In that episode, U.S. health officials tracked 600 black men in Alabama who already had syphilis but didn't give them adequate treatment even after penicillin became available. Though people in the studies were usually described as volunteers, historians and ethicists have questioned how well these people understood what was to be done to them and why, or whether they were coerced. In the last 15 years, two international studies sparked outrage. U.S.-funded doctors failed to give the AIDS drug AZT to all the HIV-infected pregnant women in a study in Uganda even though it would have protected their newborns. The other study, by Pfizer Inc., gave an antibiotic named Trovan to children with meningitis in Nigeria, although there were doubts about its effectiveness. Critics blamed the experiment for the deaths of 11 children and the disabling of scores of others. Pfizer settled a lawsuit with Nigerian officials for $75 million but admitted no wrongdoing. **Note:** Though it appears these highly unethical studies have stopped in the US, the article points out that many drug companies are now doing their studies in countries where ethical codes are not strong.

In Nevada, there are sheep whose livers and hearts are largely human. In California, mice peer from their cages with human brain cells firing inside their skulls. Biologists call these hybrid animals chimeras, after the mythical Greek creature with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail. Chimeras are allowing scientists to watch, for the first time, how nascent human cells and organs mature and interact ... inside the bodies of living creatures. But with no federal guidelines in place ... how human must a chimera be before more stringent research rules should kick in? Chimerism becomes a more sensitive topic when it involves growing entire human organs inside animals. And it becomes especially sensitive when it deals in brain cells. Imagine, said Robert Streiffer, a professor of philosophy and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, a human-chimpanzee chimera endowed with speech ... what some have called a \"humanzee.\" Perhaps the most ambitious efforts to make use of chimeras come from Irving Weissman, director of Stanford University's Institute of Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Medicine. Weissman helped make the first mouse with a nearly complete human immune system. More recently **his team injected human neural stem cells into mouse fetuses, creating mice whose brains are about 1 percent human. Now Weissman says he is thinking about making chimeric mice whose brains are 100 percent human.** **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/humananimalhybrids). **Lost city 'could rewrite history'** **2002-01-19, BBC News** [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1768109.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1768109.stm) The remains of what has been described as a huge lost city may force historians and archaeologists to radically reconsider their view of ancient human history. Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres (120 feet) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old. **The vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years.** Debris recovered from the site - including construction material, pottery, sections of walls, beads, sculpture and human bones and teeth has been carbon dated and found to be nearly 9,500 years old.

Author and film-maker Graham Hancock - who has written extensively on the uncovering of ancient civilisations [said,] \"Cities on this scale are not known in the archaeological record until roughly 4,500 years ago when the first big cities begin to appear in Mesopotamia. Nothing else on the scale of the underwater cities of Cambay is known. **There's a huge chronological problem in this discovery. It means that the whole model of the origins of civilisation with which archaeologists have been working will have to be remade from scratch,\"** he said. **Note:** Dozens of manmade complexes found under the ocean have been found, yet mainstream archeologists are largely ignoring these finds because they don't fit the academic consensus.

In Denmark, Thimerosal, a controversial mercury compound used as a preservative in certain vaccines, was removed from all Danish vaccines in 1992. The well-publicized Danish study published in Pediatrics 2003 claimed that autism rates actually increased after Thimerosal was phased out.

And that the legendary Thomas Alva Edison devised today's electrical power system? \"We were taught wrong,\" said Toby Grotz, president of the [International Tesla Society](http://www.teslasociety.com/). Two years before Marconi demonstrated his wireless radio transmission, [Nikola Tesla] performed an identical feat at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. **On June 21, 1943, in the case of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. vs. the United States, the Supreme Court ruled that that Tesla's radio patents had predated those of the Italian genius.** To be sure, Edison invented the incandesent light bulb. But he powered it and all of his other projects with inefficient direct current (DC) electricity. It was Tesla who discovered how to use the far more powerful phased form of alternating current (AC) electricity that is virtually the universal type of electricity employed by modern civilization. There are indications that Tesla also discovered many of the devices ... for the Pentagon's controversial Star Wars antimissile defense system. \"Tesla dreamed of supplying limitless amounts of power freely and equally available to all persons on Earth,\" said Grotz. And he was convinced he could do so by broadcasting electrical power across large distances just as radio transmits far smaller amounts of energy. **[Tesla's] tests ... caused lights to burn as much as 26 miles away, according to news reports of the time. ** **Note:** Tesla was written out of history texts likely because he advocated providing methods for extremely cheap electricity available to everyone. He successfully transmitted electricity through the air to lights 26 miles away. Yet the rich energy power brokers of his time could not stand for this.

The deal was this: NPR, along with a select group of media outlets, would get a briefing about an upcoming announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a day before anyone else. But in exchange for the scoop, NPR would have to abandon its reportorial independence. The FDA would dictate whom NPR's reporter could and couldn't interview. \"My editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction,\" NPR reporter Rob Stein wrote back to the government officials offering the deal. Stein asked for a little bit of leeway to do some independent reporting but was turned down flat. Take the deal or leave it. NPR took the deal - along with reporters from more than a dozen other top-tier media organizations, including CBS, NBC, CNN, the *Washington Post*, the *Wall Street Journal* and the *New York Times*. This kind of deal offered by the FDA - known as a close-hold embargo - is an increasingly important tool used by scientific and government agencies to control the behavior of the science press. **By using close-hold embargoes and other methods, the FDA, like other sources of scientific information, are gaining control of journalists who are supposed to keep an eye on those institutions. The watchdogs are being turned into lapdogs**. It is hard to tell when a close-hold embargo is afoot because, by its very nature, it is a secret. **Note:** And to see how the media is censored by big money and a corrupt judicial system, watch this [incredible video](http://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/media_censorship_video) of two crack reporters who had their major investigation into a public health threat shut down.

But drug companies don't have direct access to human subjects, so they've always contracted with academic researchers to conduct the trials on patients in teaching hospitals and clinics. Traditionally, they gave grants to the institutions for interested researchers to test their drugs, then waited for the results and hoped that their products looked good. That began to change in the 1980s, partly as a result of a new law that permitted researchers and their institutions, even if funded by the National Institutes of Health ... to patent their discoveries and license them exclusively to drug companies in return for royalties. That made them business partners, and the sponsors became intimately involved in all aspects of the clinical trials. Drug company involvement biases research in ways that are not always obvious, often by suppressing negative results. **A [review of 74 clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199864) of antidepressants, for example, found that 37 of 38 positive studies - that is, studies that showed that a drug was effective - were published. But 33 of 36 negative studies were either not published or published in a form that conveyed a positive outcome.** Bias can also be introduced through the design of a clinical trial. It's often possible to make clinical trials come out the way you and your sponsors want. Disclosure is better than no disclosure, but it does not eliminate the conflict of interest. **Note:** The above was written by Marcia Angell, former editor of *The New England Journal of Medicine*.

In the 1980s, oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In 1982, for example, [Exxon predicted](http://www.climatefiles.com/exxonmobil/1982-memo-to-exxon-management-about-co2-greenhouse-effect/) that by about 2060, CO2 levels would reach around 560 parts per million - double the preindustrial level - and that this would push the planet's average temperatures up by about 2°C over then-current levels. in 1988, an [internal report by Shell](http://www.climatefiles.com/shell/1988-shell-report-greenhouse/) projected similar effects but also found that CO2 could double even earlier, by 2030.

Delgado pioneered ... the brain chip, which manipulates the mind by electrically stimulating neural tissue with implanted electrodes. In 1965, [he] [stopped a charging bull](https://www.wanttoknow.info/650517nytimes) in its tracks by sending a radio signal to a device implanted in its brain. **He also implanted radio-equipped electrode arrays, which he called \"stimoceivers,\" in dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees, gibbons, and humans. With the push of a button, he could evoke smiles, snarls, bliss, terror, hunger, garrulousness, lust, and other responses**. Delgado also invented implantable \"chemotrodes\" that could release precise amounts of drugs directly into the brain. In 1952, Delgado co-authored ... the first peer-reviewed paper describing deep brain stimulation of humans. Over the next two decades, he implanted electrodes in some 25 subjects. Most were schizophrenics and epileptics at the now-defunct State Hospital for Mental Diseases in Howard, Rhode Island. The sponsorship of his experiments by the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Aeromedical Research Laboratory (as well as several civilian agencies) raised eyebrows. He invented a halo-like device and a helmet that could deliver electromagnetic pulses to specific neural regions.

Finally [exposed in 1972](https://apnews.com/e9dd07eaa4e74052878a68132cd3803a), the study ended and the men sued, resulting in a $9 million settlement. Twenty years ago this May, then President Bill Clinton [apologized](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/clintonp.htm) for the U.S. government. But it did not mark the end of the study's ugly legacy. Relatives of the men still struggle with the stigma of being linked to the experiment, what's commonly known as the \"[Tuskegee Syphilis Study](http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/centers_of_excellence/bioethics_center/about_the_usphs_syphilis_study.aspx).\" In 1929, government doctors ... recruited 600 black men into a health program with the promise of free medical checks, free food, free transportation and burial insurance. Health workers told syphilitic fathers, grandfathers, sons, brothers and uncles only that they had \"bad blood.\" None of the men was asked to consent to take part in a medical study, [or] told that \"bad blood\" actually was a euphemism for syphilis. Instead, doctors purposely hid the study's purpose from the men, subjecting them ... to painful spinal taps and blood tests. Medical workers periodically provided men with pills and tonic that made them believe they were being treated, but they weren't. And doctors never provided them with penicillin after it became the standard treatment for syphilis in the mid-1940s. **Note:** The \"Tuskegee Syphilis Study\" is one of many known cases of [humans being used as guinea pigs](http://www.wanttoknow.info/humanguineapigs) by [corrupt scientists](http://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptioninsciencenewsarticles). **What is \"brain hacking\"?

The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the world's growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents ... shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. The United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields - food per acre - when measured against Western Europe.

Because of this peer-review process, mistakes are supposed to be caught before they propagate in the literature. Yet despite careful pre-publication scrutiny, some reports are later retracted or, worse, widely suspected to be erroneous but never corrected. **One recent examination of 53 landmark medical studies found that further research was unable to replicate all but six of them. **How can the scientific community do better at avoiding published errors and correcting them more quickly when they are discovered? A growing group of scientists are addressing this question. They suggest incentives that will reward scientists to a greater degree for producing solid, trustworthy research that others are able to replicate successfully and then extend. **Paradoxically, the same qualities - trust and teamwork - that are key to a productive and harmonious laboratory environment are the same ones that can lead to an informality that allows errors to be propagated.** Despite the importance of retractions in correcting the scientific record, there are few guidelines as to how they should be handled or how fast self-correction should occur. To this end medical journalists Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus created the web log [Retraction Watch](http://retractionwatch.com/), which catalogs retractions as a window into the scientific process and explores the causes of each one; it has been called \"one of most important recent developments in science journalism\" by former *Scientific American* editor in chief John Rennie. **Note:** For a powerful article showing how the author of the above article, Pamela Ronald, has not been truthful in her own studies, [click here](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/03/11/retracted-gmo-studies.aspx).

In Washington, budget cuts have left the nation's research complex reeling. Labs are closing. Scientists are being laid off. Projects are being put on the shelf, especially in the risky, freewheeling realm of basic research. Yet from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, science philanthropy is hot, as many of the richest Americans seek to reinvent themselves as patrons of social progress through science research. The result is a new calculus of influence and priorities that the scientific community views with a mix of gratitude and trepidation. **\"For better or worse,\" said Steven A. Edwards, a policy analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, \"the practice of science in the 21st century is becoming shaped less by national priorities or by peer-review groups and more by the particular preferences of individuals with huge amounts of money.\"** This is philanthropy in the age of the new economy - financed with its outsize riches, practiced according to its individualistic, entrepreneurial creed. Yet that personal setting of priorities is precisely what troubles some in the science establishment. Many of the patrons, they say, are ignoring basic research - the kind that investigates the riddles of nature and has produced centuries of breakthroughs, even whole industries - for a jumble of popular, feel-good fields. **Note:** For more on corruption in science, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptioninsciencenewsarticles). **Important Note: **Explore our [full index](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) to revealing excerpts of key major media news articles on several dozen engaging topics.

I have had tremendous success with this. The [websites I currently manage](https://www.peerservice.org/) average more than 5,000 visits per day from search engines, over 50% of our total visits. Our webpages are ranked number one in literally hundreds of key searches. **Many successful websites whose programmers understand techniques to improve search engine rank get over half of their visits from searches on search engines.** Below are several key techniques that you can easily use to improve your search engine rank (also called search engine optimization or SEO) on any webpage. They are listed roughly in the order of importance based on my own experience. Unfortunately, the most important factor is also the most difficult to achieve - getting other websites to link to yours. The more websites linked to your webpage and website, the higher your rank. But following these guidelines will without doubt raise your rankings. **Before starting, you will need to choose two to five words you want to target for each individual webpage you post. These are called key words.** Think about which key words people are most likely to type into their search engine that might bring them to your webpage. Most people don't use quotation marks in their searches, so it's generally best to target individual words rather than phrases. You can also use Google Trends service at [this link](http://www.google.com/trends/) to see which words are most commonly used in searches. Use your key target words in the document's title tag (<title> in html at the top of the coded page), which is what shows in the tab at the top of every webpage. This is clearly the most heavily weighted parameter besides number of websites linking to your webpage. In the body of the page, use your target words in the title of the text. Ideally start the text title with these words. If possible, repeat these words in a subtitle with some attractive variation. Use as large a font size as possible while still being attractive for your text title. Choose a URL (Internet address which goes after your main domain name) that uses as many of your target words as reasonable. You might also consider creating subfolders named with target words to increase your ranking, i.e. http://www.website.com/keyword/keywords-to-use Use the target words as frequently as possible in the text of the webpage *without creating awkwardness*. If your title or text is awkward to read, people are not likely to read your message or link to your webpage, which is the most important support you can get. In your <meta name=\"description\" tag, use your target words, preferably before other words. Use them more than once if possible, but not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__search_engine_rank_improve.txt:0:804c874e1864", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10372, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__search_engine_rank_improve.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__search_engine_rank_improve", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "named with target words to increase your ranking, i.e. http://www.website.com/keyword/keywords-to-use Use the target words as frequently as possible in the text of the webpage *without creating awkwardness*. If your title or text is awkward to read, people are not likely to read your message or link to your webpage, which is the most important support you can get. In your <meta name=\"description\" tag, use your target words, preferably before other words. Use them more than once if possible, but not more than two or three times, as the search engines are now penalizing for this. Remember that this is the line that people will read describing your webpage. It must be engaging enough to make someone want to actually click on your link and open the page. What you write here does not show up at all on the webpage, yet it is of crucial importance to getting visits through search engines. If you have images on your webpage, use as many of your keywords as possible without creating awkwardness in both the description of the image and the \"alt\" tag of the image. Make sure your webpages redirect to use www. in the URL for those who type a URL without the www. Search engines treat these separately, so it's best to have all webpages using www. To do so, add the below code to your .htaccess file: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\\. RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L] As an example, take a look at the webpage I created at [this link](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/masons_secret_society_freemasons). In this document, I've targeted the words masons, freemasons, secret, and society. Notice that the URL contains these words. You'll also see how I've maximized the use of these two words without being too awkward. And the page usually shows up in the top 10 if you do a search on masons secret society or freemansons secret society. **You usually need to be ranked in the top 20 search listings to get any significant number of visits to your site. If you use the above techniques, you will most certainly be able to improve your ranking.** Be aware the for most websites, it can take up to a month for Google to register any changes you've made, so be patient.

Yet the underlying thrust is all about beauty, sexual desire, and how important it is to buy the products or operations which will make us popular, more attractive, and better lovers. And even though advertising and entertainment are filled with sexual innuendo, it is rare that you will find anything other than tabloids and womens magazines talking openly about both the joys and challenges of sex. In many communities, homes, and workplaces, serious discussion of sexuality continues to be a taboo subject. **Sexual orgasm is the most powerful physical pleasure that most of us ever experience. No wonder our culture is so obsessed with sex!** For caring couples who help bring each other into ecstatic orgasm, this huge wave of bliss can bring unbelievable heights of love and connection that open their hearts and souls in ways that are truly magical and profound. Yet open talk of sex and orgasm is all but taboo in todays world. The power of sexual desire is an unstoppable force of nature that plays an absolutely vital role in life on Earth. None of us would be here if our parents didnt surrender to this incredible state of ecstasy. One moment of sexual union between our mother and father is what started the dance of the sperm and egg that ended up literally birthing the bodies we now inhabit. This sexual act quite literally is what keeps humanity going from generation to generation.Without the urge to merge, none of us would be here. Yet while sex can bring incredible pleasure and rich, meaningful connection in our lives, yet it has also been the source of incredible amounts of pain and abuse when used for control and domination for many centuries. The summaries of major media news articles on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabusescandalsnewsarticles) reveal sex abuse at high levels of government, in churches, and even in the Boy Scouts. The amount of shame and secrecy around sex allows it to fester and get incredibly distorted in the darkness.

By talking about and educating ourselves on both the wonderful, empowering aspects of sexuality and the ways it has been used to control and dominate, we can set a clear course for ourselves in choosing the positive, connecting aspects of this sensitive topic and doing our best to stop the negative, destructive actions which continue rampant in our world. It is extremely rare that any of society's many sexual messages even hints at sacred sexuality or the spiritual dimensions of sex. To those who have succumbed to all of these subliminal and overt messages, sacred sexuality might even seem like a contradiction in terms. Yet many who have explored the realms of sacred sexuality and tantra have found their lives to be greatly empowered and transformed. For those interested in exploring how to bring greater depth and meaning into their sexuality, click on the link below to read an excellent online lesson titled \"Sacred Sexuality.\" [**https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/19a_sacred_sexuality**](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/19a_sacred_sexuality) As the founder of WantToKnow.info and the PEERS websites, I am deeply dedicated to shining a loving light into the shadows of ourselves and our world. Other than the above lesson on sacred sexuality and our coverage of sexual abuse scandals, sexuality has not been a topic of interest on the the PEERS website. Both I and members of our board of directors feel as sexuality is such a sensitive topic that is best to keep sexuality separate from the PEERS work. With that said, I personally have wanted to address this topic and bring sexuality out of the closet for a long time. Yet I am choosing to keep this work separate from the work of PEERS. I have taught and led events on tantra and sacred sexuality for nearly 20 years and found it to be incredibly empowering. It is a great joy to help others heal the deep, hidden shame experienced by so many and open to the beautiful aspects of sexuality which can bring much love and deeper connection. As a result, completely independent of PEERS, I have created a website which I believe will help to empower many people it their sex lives. The website is called Let's Talk Sex! and is available at [this link](http://sextalk.guru/).

It's easy to accuse the evil terrorists or the corrupt rulers of our world for creating all the problems we have to deal with both individually and collectively. **Yet how would you react if put in stressful conditions with intense social and authoritative pressure to behave in ways that go against your own ethics and morals? ** Both the Milgram experiment and the Stanford prison experiment were designed to explore this probing question. Dr. Stanley Milgram designed an experiment where normal individuals were asked by a researcher to give increasingly intense electric shocks to a subject each time they gave the wrong answer to a question. The highest level of shock had the potential of killing the subject. How far would volunteers go when told by a researcher that they should administer these intense shocks? Watch the six-minute ABC News clip below to find out. **Milgram Experiment Video [https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment)**[https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment) If you are interested in a longer, more in-depth documentary on a 2009 re-creation of this landmark human behavior study, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_2009-1). This BBC production is 20-minutes in length. As a second example, Dr. Philip Zimbardo designed the Stanford prison experiment to explore what would happen to normal college students when arbitrarily assigned to roles of prisoner and guard in a real life prison simulation done in the basement of Stanford University's psychology department. The students were paid to take on these roles for two weeks as a study of human behavior. How much would they actually conform to their assigned roles of prisoners and guards? Watch the eye-opening, 30-minute BBC documentary below to find out. **Stanford Prison Experiment Video [https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment)** Both Dr. Zimbardo and Dr. Milgram were quite surprised and disturbed by the results of their experiments. The Stanford prison experiment had to be stopped a full week early as the guards were becoming excessively brutal and even the experiment administrators were losing their objectivity. These two landmark studies have raised many questions for both researchers and all who have learned of these human experiments. **What Would You Do?** After seeing how easily most people can be influenced by authority to commit acts very much against their ethics, an important question arises. **What would you have done if you were instructed by a researcher to give possibly lethal electric shocks to the subject of a study?** What would you have done if", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__stanford_prison_experiment_milgram.txt:0:a054f04598c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10379, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__stanford_prison_experiment_milgram.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__stanford_prison_experiment_milgram", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "losing their objectivity.

Or to the role of a guard? As a guard, would you have told the other brutal guard to stop? Would you have questioned the experiment or the experimenters in either of these behavioral experiments? Our society has a strong tendency to identify with the victim and condemn the abuser. Yet how much is the abuser a victim of circumstances? How much is the oppressive behavior of the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world shaped by the conditions and social pressures into which they are born and raised? Clearly under intensely stressful conditions, we all have the propensity to become the abuser. Any of us might become the victim or even the perpetrator if the conditions were intense enough. This is the dark shadow within that most people would rather avoid. **Yet could it be our very avoidance of looking at shadows within ourselves and the shadows in our world that allow these disturbing tendencies to grow and fester?** By instead choosing to shine light on the shadow places both in ourselves and in the world, we can learn from our weaknesses. Even after just the act of watching these videos, we can each decide not to be swayed by authority and to stand up when we see injustices committed. We can further choose to explore the shadows both [within ourselves](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs) and [in the world](https://www.WantToKnow.info) in order to avoid being the victim or perpetrator. By choosing to understand both the light and the shadow inside of ourselves and in human behavior, we can become exceptions in the above experiments who say no and do not submit to oppressive authority. We can make up our mind now to not give in to the pressures of authority when we feel that doing so would go against our values and beliefs. When we are clear on our priorities and understand both our shadows and our light, we can take the power and authority into our own hands and set a positive example for ourselves and all around us. Could it be that the line dividing good and evil truly cuts through each one of our hearts? What might happen if instead of punishing the perpetrators and locking them up into institutions which foster more violence, we focused on understanding what causes people to commit violence?

[**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell) All these videos show not that humans are inherently bad or evil, nor that we are inherently good. They show that when we are not clear in our own [priorities and intentions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions), and when we give too much power to authority, we can be manipulated and controlled in ways that do not serve anyone. They also show that when we understand ourselves and make a choice to be aware of our weaknesses, yet focus on building our strengths, we can be a positive force in building a better world for all of us.

Notice how quickly the 2009 movement which focused on the 1% vs. the 99% was shut down and is never mentioned now due to intense polarization promulgated by the media and government backed by the big boys. In his brilliant essay below, Taibbi shows how both the 2009 banking bailout and the COVID bailout ultimately resulted in a huge transfer of wealth into the pockets of the elite. The the vast majority of bailout funds sooner or later were funneled into the fat pockets of the uber elite with hardly scraps thrown to the middle and lower classes.

He combines Ron Burgundy-style slapstick teleprompter-dependence ... with the terror of a man who can see the bright light coming. Both effects are worsened by the fact that **he's peddling an insane, indefensible lie, i.e. that America is suffering through \"Putin price hikes,\" and not the inevitable consequence of yet another transparent state-aided ripoff scheme to soak the middle and lower classes on behalf of the 1%.** Possibly Biden's people have secret polling showing that the public will buy the gambit, but the blunt truth is the rent is just coming due on years of Fed-fueled partying, and officials know it. They've repeatedly tried to lie anyway. As far back as last May, Biden's Treasury Secretary, former Fed chief Janet Yellen, was reassuring the public that \"I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle,\" and though \"we expect somewhat higher inflation over the next several months,\" this would be for \"essentially technical reasons,\" and \"a transitory thing\": **Both Yellen and Fed chief Jay Powell kept insisting that inflation was \"transitory.\" **Then, just a few weeks ago Yellen, in an interview that in a darkly humorous way recalled Alan Greenspan's infamous \"[I've found a flaw\" testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcyehH2W-oU) about his belief that the self-correcting market should have stopped the mortgage manias before 2008, conceded to a feisty Wolf Blitzer that \"I think I was wrong\" to downplay the risk of inflation. Of course, **Yellen immediately shifted to the \"Putin price hike\" excuse, blaming \"unanticipated... shocks\" in energy and food prices for America's troubles.** **Even CNN wasn't convinced.

This time around, in place of Alan Greenspan telling people to hop into the counter-intuitive \"[new paradigm\" of growth without inflation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news-analysis-us-data-suggests-new-paradigm-is-here-to-stay-1120286.html) (during the Internet bubble), or recommending people use their [home equity savings as ATM machines](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-248) (in the heat of the wealth-eating mortgage Ponzi), we saw the Yellens and Powells of the world telling us inflation was \"transitory.\" Come on in, the water's great! And jump in people did. **What really happened: at the start of the pandemic, on March 2, 2020, the Federal Reserve owned about $4.24 trillion in assets. After the passage of the bipartisan CARES Act and several subsequent COVID relief packages** backed by both parties (one signed by Trump, another by Biden), the Fed went on an unprecedented buying spree. **Their balance sheet reached a peak of about $8.96 trillion in assets in April of this year,** before beginning a slight downward descent.

Who got out, and who took a beating? One hint lay in the fact that **executives all over spent as much cash as they could on stock buybacks during the pandemic years. When companies buy back their own stock, they retire the shares, raising the stock's value overall. The maneuver pays off top shareholders, who again by extraordinary coincidence are often the very executives approving the buybacks,** while investing vast sums not in growing the firm or creating jobs, but in increasing the worth of the stock shares often used as compensation. During the pandemic, we had example after example of firms rushing into buyback plans the instant they got splashed by the COVID cash waterfall. **Defense contractors for instance got a special dispensation from the government at the outset of COVID, granted $4.6 billion in an \"accelerated payment program\" that gave firms like Lockheed-Martin credit for outstanding contracts even if they hadn't been fulfilled. **The industry responded by taking that $4.6 billion in cash and [repurchasing $4.8 billion of its own stock](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2021/05/10/defense-department-payment-plan-enriching-contractors-who-are-upping-stock-buybacks/?sh=72d4fb4f57f9) just in that quarter, more than the entire previous year. It wasn't until this year that the Pentagon decided to \"weigh\" whether or not to suspend the accelerated payments, which by early this year [reached $5.3 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/pentagon-weighs-ending-speedy-payments-to-contractors-started-for-the-pandemic/2022/03/09/5b9dfa7c-9fb1-11ec-9438-255709b6cddc_story.html) just for the so-called \"top-5\" contractors: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics. Overall, S&P companies repurchased a record $234.5 billion in stock in the third quarter of 2021, and this was after a record $[2 trillion buyback binge](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/business/coronavirus-stock-buybacks.html?searchResultPosition=1) in the three years preceding the pandemic.

One could go on and on. **One industry after the next cleaned up in the last few years, and top executives across the board cashed out as quickly as they could,** in as many ways as they could.

Also** just like 2008, the moment everything crashes, the predators left with cash on hand will scour the landscape, look for \"babies thrown out with the bathwater,\" as one finance-sector friend of mine put it, and go on a buying spree, again, as they did with mortgages after 2008.** \"That's when they make the real money,\" he said. We already saw this in microcosm at the outset of the pandemic.

Our hedges were in the form of purchases of credit protection on various global investment grade and high yield credit indices...* *For all of the above reasons, we became increasingly positive on equity and credit markets last week, and began the process of unwinding our hedges and **redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices** that are built to withstand this crisis, and which we believe will flourish long term.* That happened in microcosm in 2020, and it'll happen again when the \"storm clouds\" of 2022 turn into a real storm, which is expected sooner rather than later. **The Democrats, in a decision that lays bare their admirable consistency in underestimating the public's intelligence, are trying to pass off the ridiculous notion that inflation and other market disruptions are the fault of Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, and not due to the $4.7 trillion in central bank subsidies that 1%-ers have been gulping like Jell-o shots for over two years now.** This is not to say the Russian oil and agricultural disruptions have no effect on the economy. They're more like additional unexpected complications piled atop a set of problems that were already both massive and \"baked in the cake,\" as Blankfein might put it. The larger issue is whom exactly the Bidens, Yellens, and Powells of the world represent. As far back as 2016 (when both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump put the Fed at the center of their campaign pitches), there's been a growing sense among voters that national financial policy, and especially central bank policy, is dictated by the needs and desires of the very few. As that friend of mine points out, the notion that the managers of monetary policy don't serve ordinary people is not a new one. Once upon a time, such resentments fueled the populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who saw the push for a gold standard as a gambit to protect with \"hard money\" the wealth gains of those who owned financial assets (as opposed to those who did not), with Bryan saying famously, \"You shall", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__taibbi-blue-red-ripped-off.txt:6:2f014bf38bdb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10389, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__taibbi-blue-red-ripped-off.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__taibbi-blue-red-ripped-off", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "of the very few.

However, in the long run it's the very wealthy who may have recent gains to protect who have the most to lose from this volatility, and it's their interests the coming tightening will be designed to serve. **Just like 2008, when piles of public treasure made gambling-addict banks whole again while individual savers and homeowners got wiped out and told to \"suck it in and cope,\" these post-2020 Fed policies made a handful of very big winners while gearing up to make losers of the rest.** Then and now, the pain will cut across geography and party. **The wealth gap [widened](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/a-tale-of-two-recoveries-wealth-inequality-after-the-great-recession/) significantly after the 2008 bailouts and has already done so again in the pandemic period, when the [bottom 99% worldwide](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/04/economic-inequality-wealth-gap-pandemic/) is worse off than at the start of the emergency, and just those slivers of high society listed above saw jumps.** After 2008, there was intense propaganda to deflect public attention from the causes of the crash. The new emphasis will be on making sure culture-war issues prevent the losers in this latest bubble - be they millennial day-traders who became collateral damage to the crypto crash, or inner-city wage earners forced to watch their purchasing power wiped out via inflation - from realizing they may have shared antagonists in seats of financial power. **This is a constant in financial predation stories that's virtually always ignored in the popular press, which insists on portraying blue and red America as separate worlds, whose citizens have nothing in common.

On one hand, 2023 was yet another year plagued with corruption, tragedy, social conflict, and loss of civil liberties. Law enforcement agencies have [militarized US streets](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-after-20-years-department-homeland-security-a-moneyguzzling-failure), conducting [surveillance of US citizens](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--us-openly-stockpiling-dirt-all-its-citizens) engaged in constitutionally protected activities often through the use of increasingly sophisticated tools like [geofence warrants](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-techscape-how-police-use-location-search-data-find-suspects--not-always-right-ones). More than [1,500 police departments](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-its-bird-its-plane-its-police-responding-a-911-call) are now using drone technology for aerial surveillance, which led to [civil action in the Michigan Supreme Court](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-eff-michigan-court-governments-shouldnt-be-allowed-use-drone-spy-you-without-warrant) for violating the Fourth Amendment. Human rights and civil liberty groups [wrote a report](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-119k-people-hurt-riotcontrol-weapons-since-2015) this year that 119,000 people have been significantly hurt by crowd-control weapons since 2015. Yet looking back at the hundreds of news articles we've summarized, this year's news was full of revelations, courageous reporting, and the liberation of alternative perspectives and news platforms. In this newsletter, we'll take a look back and explore this year's news on censorship issues, COVID, the US war machine, UFO disclosure, and health and food corruption. The information we cover is often challenging, unsettling and complex. Yet we value questioning authority in healthy ways. **We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us - in our personal lives and as a society - we already have a degree of freedom from it.** Facing the truth of the world heals divides and empowers constructive change. Root causes of human and environmental suffering are uncovered: the money, players, and belief systems that drive the machine. Most importantly, challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that bring these injustices to light-fueling open dialogue and constructive action. **Censorship** The unleashing of independent voices in the media landscape has empowered democracy while threatening the forces attempting to control public discourse through sophisticated propaganda techniques. These include government agencies like the US Department of Homeland Security's [Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-agency-under-homeland-security-masterminded-attempt-control-publics-thought-speech-during-pandemic) and military-intelligence contractors of the Cyber Threat Intelligence League (CTIL). **A [recent trove of whistleblower documents](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-ctil-files-1-us-uk-military-contractors-created-sweeping-plan-global-censorship-2018-new-documents-show) revealed [how far the Pentagon](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-pentagon-was-involved-domestic-censorship-scheme-new-ctil-whistleblower-files-show) and spy agencies like CISA and CTIL are willing to go to censor alternative voices, from cutting off financial services to individuals who organize rallies and events to \"discussing ways to promote \"counter-messaging,\" co-opt hashtags, dilute disfavored messaging, create sock puppet accounts, and infiltrate private invite-only groups.\" In one of their reports, they discuss how the ability to reach mass audiences once belonged to government and corporate media, and raised deep concern that the flow of information is becoming harder to control.** The open flow of information is crucial to a free society.

Silencing alternative voices and views through media manipulation and censorship makes it easy for the powerful to hide exploitation and injustice. In the case of Biden v. Missouri, Judge Terry Doughty ruled in July that the collusion between Big Tech and the White House to censor speech was [unconstitutional](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--bidenbig-tech-collusion-case). And most importantly, the content being censored wasn't necessarily misinformation or fake news. The views simply [challenged mainstream narratives](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-many-censored-social-media-posts-did-not-contain-covid19-misinformation). *Discovery in Missouri v. Biden exposed relationships among government agencies and social-media firms and revealed an additional layer of university centers and self-styled disinformation watchdogs and fact-checking outfits. Elon Musk's release of some of Twitter's internal files revealed that [**up to 80 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-congress-set-expose-what-may-be-largest-censorship-system-us-history) were embedded with social-media companies. The agents mostly weren't fighting terrorism but flagging wrongthink by American citizens, including eminent scientists who suggested different paths on Covid policy. The information explosion has allowed more people to spot quickly the mistakes of officials. Those in charge feel threatened. Digital censorship is their response to this crisis of authority. **True, misinformation is rampant online. But it was far worse before the internet, when myths could persist for centuries**.* - Excerpt from *Wall Street Journal*, \"[COVID Censorship Proved To Be Deadly](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-covid-censorship-proved-be-deadly)\" Interestingly enough, the censorship of alternative views on COVID, Ukraine, climate change, and other issues didn't sound the alarm bell as much as the censorship of pro-Palestinian voices in the wake of the tragic war in Gaza. [Media outrage about the censorship of pro-Palestinian views](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-media-decides-censorship-bad-now-it-hits-left) led to social media companies quickly making widespread fixes to their systems. The issue of censorship calls for a deeper question: **How do we uplevel our activism in ways that honor the intersectionality of all issues calling for democracy and freedom in an oppressive system?** **COVID** If accepting the official COVID story was indeed the most effective way to end the pandemic, a pro-science society would still seek to understand alternative perspectives pointing to harm and injustice. Many of these harms are only beginning to come to light. We recently wrote a long-form investigative essay, \"*[New Revelations About COVID Vaccine Injuries and Lawsuits, Examining Big Pharma Corruption, and Media Censorship](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus/covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption)*,\" which documents the latest news regarding COVID vaccines: landmark lawsuits, the shocking numbers of vaccine injuries and deaths, to the [surveillance strategies](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-moderna-spying-you) of COVID vaccine manufacturers and their efforts to shape public discourse about vaccines.

Undisclosed safety risks and harms must be investigated, even if those investigations produce inconvenient findings. Yet instead, it's becoming increasingly likely that COVID vaccine manufacturers and high-level government officials were aware of vaccine harms, from covering up [significant adverse cardiac events](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-cdc-covered-up-covid-vaccine-myocarditis) to [Pfizer delaying the reporting](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-pfizer-hid-nearly-80-covid-vaccine-trial-deaths-from-regulators) of vaccine-associated deaths during their clinical trials. COVID news this year went beyond vaccine concerns. [Mainstream media outlets](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-immunity-acquired-from-covid-infection-as-protective-as-vaccination-against-severe-illness-death-study-finds) and renowned medical journals like [*The Lancet*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-three-years-late-lancet-recognizes-natural-immunity) admitted that natural immunity is just as effective (if not more) than vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV2 was [likely engineered](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-key-scientist-covid-origin-controversy-misled-congress-status-89-million-nih-grant) in the [context of bioweapons research](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-covid-coverup-how-science-was-silenced) with [US funding and Chinese military involvement](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-documents-link-potential-covid-patient-zero-usfunded-research-wuhan) at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. A [whistleblower testimony](https://oversight.house.gov/release/wenstrup-reveals-new-allegations-that-dr-fauci-potentially-influenced-cia-covid-19-origins-investigation/) from a senior-level CIA officer recently alleged that the CIA attempted to skew its COVID origins review by [offering significant financial incentives](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-cia-tried-pay-off-analysts-bury-findings-covid-lab-leak-was-likely-whistleblower) to six analysts in order to change their conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a Wuhan lab. In January of 2024, former chief White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci will [testify before Congress](https://apnews.com/article/anthony-fauci-covid-congress-house-republicans-7ad4577a450bca1232a60b32a73ec944) on COVID origins. Concerns that COVID death counts and hospitalization rates were heavily inflated also surfaced this past year: *According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States is experiencing around 400 covid deaths every day. At that rate, there would be nearly 150,000 deaths a year. But are these Americans dying from covid or with covid? Robin Dretler ... the former president of Georgia's chapter of Infectious Diseases Society of America, estimates that at his hospital, **90 percent of patients diagnosed with covid are actually in the hospital for some other illness.** \"Since every hospitalized patient gets tested for covid, many are incidentally positive,\" he said. A gunshot victim or someone who had a heart attack, for example, could test positive for the virus, but the infection has no bearing on why they sought medical care. If these patients die, covid might get added to their death certificate. **But the coronavirus was not the primary contributor to their death and often played no role at all.*** - Excerpt from *Washington Post*, \"[We are overcounting covid deaths and hospitalizations. That's a problem.](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-we-overcounting-covid-deaths-hospitalizations-thats-problem)\" **US War Machine** Meanwhile, the US war machine has continued to fuel conflicts all over the world.

A [new analysis in March](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-us-sold-weapons-nearly-60-percent-worlds-authoritarian-nations-2022) revealed that the US sold weapons to nearly 60% of the world's authorization nations in 2022. A Tax Day analysis reported that defense contractors like Lockheed Martin got [$106 from the average taxpayer](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-lockheed-martin-got-106-from-average-taxpayer-while-renewables-got-just-6) in 2022, which is 4x as much money as primary and secondary education. More information also came to light about the [shocking lack of oversight](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-two-decades-90-billion-us-dollars-later-dissecting-afghan-militarys-total-collapse) of money and equipment sent to Afghanistan. When the US military retreated from Afghanistan two years ago, huge amounts of equipment left behind have now turned the Taliban into a [major arms dealer](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--taliban-now-arms-dealers) in the Middle East, which has fueled violence and division in the region. According to a Taliban official, they took possession of \"more than 300,000 light arms, 26,000 heavy weapons, and about 61,000 military vehicles.\" **This month, we launched our new [Military-Intelligence Corruption Information Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/military-intelligence-corruption-information), which provides a comprehensive and sobering look into the US military-intelligence apparatus behind America's endless wars: what it is, who benefits, and who pays the price. The true impacts of US military-intelligence activities in countries all over the world are examined, from World War II to our present moment in time.** **UFO Disclosure** The US government finally acknowledged the existence of UFOs/UAPs on a mainstream level. This is progress, but there's clearly much more that we aren't being told with their heavily sanitized narratives about the phenomenon. Still, it came to light that US troops have [reported on hundreds of UFO sightings](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-ufo-reports-us-troops-skyrocket-over-500). Compelling testimonies by high-level military and intelligence officials illustrate the likelihood that the US government has [secretly recovered non-human spacecrafts for decades](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-whistleblower-claims-spacecrafts-the-bodies-pilots-have-been-found-the-us-government-decades) and conducted \"[Roswell-style UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-six-whistleblowers-who-claim-they-worked-military-ufo-programs-retrieving-analyzing-crash-material-have-come-forward-spill-their-secrets-senior-members-congress)\".

[Internal pharmaceutical industry documents](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-internal-pharma-documents-reveal-strategies-used-corrupt-medical-field) recently obtained through litigation revealed widespread corruption within the medical field, from bribery to ghost management strategies. * The pharmaceutical industry is driven by commercial interests, not public health, and this problem is compounded by a lack of transparency, conflicts of interests, manipulation of clinical trials, and undue corporate influence across the government. Marketing companies ghostwrite pharmaceutical studies for academics who sometimes barely read the papers that get submitted to medical journals, and drug makers then cite these ghostwritten studies as peer-reviewed proof of their products' safety and efficacy. **The revolving door between Big Pharma and the FDA spins faster than the one between the Pentagon and the defense industry.*** - Kim Witczack, member of a FDA advisory committee and advocate for pharmaceutical drug safety and FDA reform (Excerpt from the Disinformation Chronicle on Substack, \"[Americans are Fools for Pharma](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-americans-fools-pharma)\") As we move into the new year, may we transform 2023's learning curves into constructive action.

It will be fascinating to see what comes to light this coming year. While society's challenges often produce a sense of helplessness and despair, the most important thing we have control over is how we choose to engage with these issues. We can choose to become more polarized, angry, and divisive. Or, we can choose to stay curious, humble, and committed to the greater good and what's possible. Outcomes are not in our control, but our commitment is ours to make. A while back, I came across a powerful quote: **\"Challenge your fears and ego for inner peace.

Especially in the face of this global coronavirus crisis, it's time for that giant to realize its power to shape and create its own destiny. That sleeping giant is humanity. It's the combined energies and potentials of all of us. And one documentary can give this giant the jolt it needs to awaken and realize its power. **One eye-opening documentary can bring us the awakening we need to become both the empowered sovereign individuals and the unstoppable collective power that we are, especially in this time of great uncertainty.** The name of that documentary is *Conspiracy of Silence*. Originally scheduled to air in May of 1994 on the Discovery Channel, *Conspiracy of Silence* was yanked at the last minute due to formidable pressure applied by certain top politicians. All copies were ordered to be destroyed. Only years later did a very rough cut copy come to light provided by a courageous insider. This is a documentary that some very powerful people did not want you to see. Up until now, the vast majority of people have closed their eyes to what is revealed in this profound, hour-long film. It presents solid evidence of how countless compromised children are provided by certain nefarious groups to powerful and influential leaders who are then caught on video having sex with children. With the power to ruin their careers by releasing these videos, these groups can then easily blackmail these leaders to help forward their own agendas. Jeffrey Epstein and his gang are but one recent example of this. Besides blackmail, these groups forward their agenda of gaining ever greater control and power over the rest of us in two key ways: fear and polarization. They love to fan the flames of fear and to keep us divided and fighting against each other so that we don't even realize how we are being manipulated. When we are consumed by fear and polarization, it is much easier for these groups to manipulate our emotions so that without even realizing it, we acquiesce to their agenda. When the slumbering giant briefly awakened after the 2009 banking crisis, for the first time the focus shifted from left vs. right to the 1% vs. the 99%. But these powerful groups quickly took action to put the giant back to sleep. They steered our focus away from the powerful elite back to the old polarization of conservatives fighting liberals, Obama haters fighting Obama lovers, and then Trump haters battling Trump lovers. Have you noticed that no one is talking about the 1% these days? **And now these powerful groups are using the legitimate concern of the coronavirus to push", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__time-to-awaken.txt:0:79fe42066179", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10399, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__time-to-awaken.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__time-to-awaken", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "vs. right to the 1% vs. the 99%.

Yet with [predictions of millions dead](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/the-coronavirus-could-kill-millions-of-americans-cdc-advisor-says.html) in the U.S., claims of the [virus being everywhere](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-bills-covid19-paper-money-20200320-jv6fop2c3reaxoinhesvhlccyy-story.html), and the deepening polarization of left vs. right, the pandemic is causing most people to once again fall into the trap of fear and polarization. Yet even more disturbing is how so many children are being trafficked to serve both the base desires of influential leaders and the agendas of these child sex rings. If enough people knew about this they would be out in the streets demanding that it be stopped. Yet sadly, very few have been willing to look at the solid, verifiable evidence that child sex trafficking is far more rampant than was thought and, in fact, reaches to the highest levels in our world. **In these most intense times where everything in our world is changing and no one knows how it will unfold, it's vitally important that each of us and humanity as a collective be willing to shine a light into these darkest shadows.** Many feel too overwhelmed to look into these dark doings. Yet if we continue to close our eyes, this ugly wound will continue to fester and grow. Only if we have the courage to do this - the courage to look into the belly of the beast - can we make fully informed choices as we open our collective eyes and chart the path to a new, more inspiring way of life on this beautiful jewel of a planet. **[*Conspiracy of Silence*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence) - A documentary funded by the Discovery Channel ** I recommend watching this with a friend or loved one, if possible, as what you will watch is disturbing.

But as you will see, the information presented is incredibly well documented by many dozens of highly reputable individuals and organizations. **If we close our eyes and turn away, we risk plunging humanity into a dark future filled with fear and with ever greater isolation and loss of power.

You may come to the conclusion that - though the coronavirus is real and dangerous - the level of fear is being ramped up to keep everyone afraid and willing to do whatever \"the authorities\" tell us. You will be empowered to better make rational, educated choices, and to resist succumbing to excessive fear in these intense times. You especially will want to know what we can do about these nefarious groups and their agenda.

I've also been blessed to make contact with many other key awakened individuals who have opened the eyes of millions in our world. Yet we need many millions more to make this shift. And you can be a part of it. Each of us can mend the part of the world within our reach. You can play a vital role in helping to awaken the sleeping giant. You can help to stop the harm being done to our children and to do what we came here to do.

Political identity has become the ultimate source of meaning for many-driven largely by media narratives that distort complex issues into polarizing soundbites. These narratives are eroding civil discourse and fueling division in our everyday conversations and relationships. **We're taking public discourse back from the powerful forces determined to divide us. In this [31-min video](https://youtu.be/X1v_enb8S9Y), we explore two essential conversations:** the political, government, and corporate forces shaping public perception and reality itself real-life examples, creative solutions, and stories that help us move beyond fear-toward a more informed, connected, and collaborative society [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) has spent 20+ years researching and making sense of media deception and propaganda beyond partisan lines. Much of the societal noise dominating our conversations is generated by a media machine designed to discourage viewpoint diversity. This machine presents us with the **illusion of consensus** about the official story while at the same time promoting the **illusion of division** by amplifying extremes. In other words, our fears about each other aren't a natural response to genuine threats, but a reaction to distorted media messaging that hijacks our emotions, pits us against one another, and collapses complex issues into artificial binaries. Going deeper, we believe that media manipulation exploits something deeply human: our evolutionary wiring to protect ourselves and our community from danger. In today's media landscape, the negative news overload constantly triggers this evolutionary need-flooding us with an endless barrage of character attacks and smears, existential worst-case scenarios, disasters, and who's to blame. This all contributes to a cycle of cynicism, apathy, and exhaustion-where media polarization replaces any real or more nuance understanding of the complex and multi-dimensional challenges we face. We believe that people are perfectly capable of finding the truth together when corporate and political interests stop interfering with the process. Let's overcome any construct meant to divide and disempower us. Let's radically broaden our views and bring our focus back to the collective values that are less about politics and more about tapping into our biological imperative to connect, cooperate, and co-create shared meaning. **RELATED LINKS**: [Transforming the War Machine, One Human Story At A Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i-JMD0qrLA) [Healing the Culture Wars-One Conscious Conversation at a Time](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/healing-the-culture-warsone-conscious) Listen to our [PEERS Inspiring Action music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvwwRgjvNYLbzqii8fhK8n7ncIVxjT79) Our database stands as one of the most comprehensive collections of conspiracy and corruption news, featuring over 13,000+ news article summaries from reliable and credible media sources and many categories for in-depth exploration.

What is most fascinating and rarely discussed isn't his stance on civil rights, but his willingness to speak out about the crimes and atrocities committed by covert elements within the US government. Below, we discuss nefarious efforts by the US military, intelligence, and law enforcement machinery to harass, blackmail, discredit, and spy on Dr. King. We also reveal undeniable evidence connecting these abuses of power to his tragic assassination on April 4, 1968. **Few people know about the 1999 King Family civil trial in Memphis, where it took a jury only one hour to determine that the US government was behind the [assassination of King](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/martin-luther-king-trial-government-guilty). ** In sharing this important and little-known information, we draw upon the powerful words and experience of journalist and human rights lawyer Dr. William Pepper in his book [*The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Plot-to-Kill-King-audiobook/dp/B01MXYQ3VH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FT8A51TJW2TT&keywords=the+plot+to+kill+king&qid=1705276860&s=books&sprefix=the+plot+to+kill+k%2Cstripbooks%2C153&sr=1-1). Pepper was a personal friend to King and the attorney for the King Family. He also represented King's alleged murderer James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan in the trial for the murder of Robert Kennedy. While the information presented here is deeply unsettling, we honor the powerful vision and faith in human goodness that shaped King's activism. Heavily influenced by the nonviolent teachings of Mahatma Gandhi who he saw as a \"guiding light,\" King believed that truth and peace are inseparable. **Truth is rooted in a refusal to do harm with our words and actions, and a personal readiness to suffer for it. **He believed that death and destruction imposed on others, no matter who they are, was an injury to all other human beings. After grieving over photographs of slaughtered Vietnamese children and the destructive use of napalm and white phosphorus on innocent Vietnamese people, he resolved to call passionate attention to harmful US war agendas in every corner of America he visited. *I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway of destruction.

The focus was to bring people together nationwide, highlighting the importance of an anti-poverty and anti-war agenda that would radically shift American society from a \"thing-oriented society\" powered by weapons and machines to a person-oriented society born out of freedom and equality. King dreamed of a global society of peace and cooperation, where the forces and conditions that give rise to war would be eliminated. **He envisioned a movement that would activate a deeper consciousness in activism and politics. **His position on war was a natural extension of the civil rights struggle. As King once said, \"*A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom*.\" The hefty cost of the war required that essential social services and programs in American communities be cut, disproportionately impacting low-income people and communities of color. In addressing freedom and inequality, he began passionately organizing the Poor People's Campaign project, which would involve a tent city of hundreds of thousands of America's most marginalized and underserved communities occupying the Washington Monument. They would remain for as long as it took Congress to take action on restoring social welfare programs. King's actions attracted negative attention from powerful interests. They were threatened by his unifying and empowering message. These interests included politicians, government agents, oil companies, military contractors and multinational banks that all profited lavishly from the war machine and economic inequality. *When one assesses the awesome array of privately established, nongovernmental, institutional power, it is eminently reasonable to consider those in government decision-making positions as being compelled to listen to, protect, and serve the unified interest of this corporate establishment. * **When business speaks with one voice, as it did in respect to the war or the purported extreme threat of war, at the time when Dr. King set himself up in opposition, the relevant government agencies and their officials became mere foot soldiers for the mighty economic interests. ** Out in front during war are the armed forces and the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Not far behind are the executive, the legislative, and the judicial legitimizers, who sanction the necessary action.

Following King's powerful speech \"Beyond Vietnam,\" [168 newspapers attacked him](https://www.npr.org/2010/03/30/125355148/the-story-of-kings-beyond-vietnam-speech).

A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Center for National Security Studies exposed a little-known CIA division known as the Office of Security (OS), which focused heavily on Dr. King during the 60s and had a strong working relationship with Hoover of the FBI. The OS coordinated a wide range of operations. This included assassination efforts, as illustrated in a [declassified government document](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10213-10101.pdf) revealing OS collaboration with organized crime in attempts to [assassinate Fidel Castro](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--cia-schemes-kill-castro--with-seashell). **[Operation CHAOS and Project RESISTANCE](https://downloads.paperlessarchives.com/p/vc6p/) were covert CIA programs that also engaged in collecting domestic surveillance on protesters, antiwar groups, and individuals challenging official stories.

Ray never had a fair trial, and Pepper was convinced of Ray's innocence. He continued to investigate the case even after Ray died. In 1999, Pepper and the King family filed a civil action in Memphis against a man who admitted he was involved: Loyd Jowers, owner of a restaurant near where King was assassinated. Jowers would later admit to being part of the conspiracy to kill King, and he would be found responsible for the killing, along with various government agencies. *The King v. Jowers civil trial ... went on for 30 days with some 70 witnesses. It was not covered by the media.

In the civil trial, she testified that he had been delivered a large sum of money right before the assassination. **Seconds after the gunshots, she saw him rush into the back of the grill through the back door with the rifle. He then wrapped the weapon in a tablecloth and hid it under the counter. He turned to her and said, \"Betty, you wouldn't do anything to hurt me, would you?\"** Testimonials from countless witnesses including King's driver and *New York Times* reporter Earl Caldwell described seeing the shot come from the bushes and not from the bathroom of the rooming house as the official story states. A witness testified that she heard a fireman announce to the police that \"The shot came from that clump of bushes,\" indicating the heavily overgrown brushy area facing the Lorraine and adjacent to Fire Station 2. **The next morning, Memphis public works employees cut down the bushes and destroyed a \"possible crime scene.\"** Usual special body guards provided by the Memphis police were advised they \"weren't needed\" on the day of the assassination. **Dr. King's room was also changed from a secure 1st-floor room to an exposed balcony room.** Along with sanitizing a crime scene, police abandoned the standard investigative procedure of interviewing witnesses who lived by the scene of the shooting.

Their cooperation was dependent on remaining anonymous. Warren and Murphy were both active in covert Special Operation Group (SOG) missions in Vietnam. Throughout 1967, they were involved in the highly secretive [902ndMilitary Intelligence Group (MIG) operations](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html#902), which was run by Colonel John Downie, Lyndon Johnson's former Vietnam briefer. As members of small \"Alpha team\" units for the 902nd MIG, Murphy and Warren were deployed in cities where violence was breaking out. **They were issued photographs and personal information of black radical activists who were designated as targets to be \"taken out\" if a disruption or riot broke out. ** Warren and Murphy would then participate in a Memphis Special Forces training team in civilian disguise, positioned to shoot King on top of the nearby Illinois Central Railroad Building. The two men told Pepper that their commander's \"pep talk\" involved showing pictures of King and Reverend Andrew Young, who was with King in Memphis. **It was stressed to Warren and Murphy that these men were enemies of the US and had plans to bring down the government, which would result in catastrophic results for cities if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam's_secret_wars)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination.txt:7:e83ae8f18acd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10412, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam's_secret_wars)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice of infiltrating and spying on US activist groups, finding that [their surveillance](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3019&context=ilj&httpsredir=1&referer=) was both \"unauthorized and in violation of the first amendment.\" ** In 1996, Tompkins received a phone call from Colonel Downie, who found Pepper's research on the King assassination in his first book [*Orders to Kill*](https://www.amazon.com/Orders-Kill-Behind-Murder-Martin/dp/1483047415#:~:text=After%20eighteen%20years%20of%20intensive,nation's%20greatest%20civil%20rights%20leader.) \"remarkably accurate,\" yet felt that he gave Downie too much responsibility for the operation. Downie described himself as \"an officer in a chain of command following orders.\" Colonel Downie, refusing to meet with Pepper, agreed to meet with Tompkins. Downie confirmed he played a key role in coordinating the military units in Memphis during the week leading up to and on King's assassination. He also admitted that Ray was one of many people used as \"patsies\" in various covert operations. By the summer of 1997, Colonel Downie had disappeared. *We learned that the 902nd MIG was involved in a clandestine joint venture operation with Carlos Marcello's Mafia family, whereby stolen weapons from US military bases, camps, and arsenals were delivered to Marcello's property, loaded onto barges, and shipped to the Gulf at Houston, where they were off-loaded, repackaged, and sold to right-wing forces in Latin and South America. **The profits were split 50-50 between the 902nd and the mob, with the 902nd using the profits to fund further black operations. This particular operation, the assassination of Dr. King, was ... confirmed by two members of the Alpha 184 sniper team.*** - Excerpt from *Plot to Kill King* **King's Legacy** Many questions remain unanswered about the nature of the money, players, and motives behind the King assassination. His murder raises important questions about the deeper forces undermining meaningful efforts to radically transform society for the greater good. May the information presented here serve as a sobering reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, especially of the very forces within government for whom we put our faith in to uphold America's greatest interests. Despite these stark realities, King remains a powerful moral voice for our times in the wake of the endless US war machine that continues to fuel conflict and destruction worldwide. *Now, what kind of man was he?

So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy.* - Dr. Pepper In these challenging times, there are many reasons for grief, confusion, and rage. King wrote about these related concerns in his final book *[Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos Or Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F)*. He asserted that humankind has the resources and technology to overcome oppression and corruption. King felt that our best hope for a durable future beyond the harms and abuses of our world must be rooted in the Greek concept of *agape*, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. *Agape* is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all.\" It is the willingness to go to any length to restore community. In *Chaos or Community*, **he calls on the \"creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.\"** As a practitioner in nonviolence, he carried a deep faith in the future. His struggle for justice was accompanied by what he called a cosmic, creative force integrating the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole. May we lead with the courage that King gracefully and fiercely role modeled for us, freeing ourselves from excessive fear and transforming \"us\" vs. \"them\" in thought and action as we work for the well-being of all. ***The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.*** - Dr. King Your financial support makes a difference.

What is most fascinating and rarely discussed isn't his stance on civil rights, but his willingness to speak out about the crimes and atrocities committed by covert elements within the US government. Below, we discuss nefarious efforts by the US intelligence, military, and law enforcement machinery to harass, blackmail, discredit, and spy on Dr. King. We also reveal undeniable evidence connecting these abuses of power to his tragic assassination on April 4, 1968. **Few people know about the 1999 King Family civil trial in Memphis, where it took a jury only one hour to determine that the US government was behind the [assassination of King](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/martin-luther-king-trial-government-guilty). ** In sharing this important and little-known information, we draw upon the powerful words and experience of journalist and human rights lawyer Dr. William Pepper in his book [*The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr*](https://www.amazon.com/Plot-Kill-King-Behind-Assassination/dp/1536682195). Pepper was a personal friend to King and the attorney for the King Family. He also represented King's alleged murderer James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan in the trial for the murder of Robert Kennedy. While the information presented here is deeply unsettling, we honor the powerful vision and faith in human goodness that shaped King's activism. Heavily influenced by the nonviolent teachings of Mahatma Gandhi who he saw as a \"guiding light,\" King believed that truth and peace are inseparable. **Truth is rooted in a refusal to do harm with our words and actions, and a personal readiness to suffer for it. **He believed that death and destruction imposed on others, no matter who they are, was an injury to all other human beings. After grieving over photographs of slaughtered Vietnamese children and the destructive use of napalm and white phosphorus on innocent Vietnamese people, he resolved to call passionate attention to harmful US war agendas in every corner of America he visited. *I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway of destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future.

I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor. * ***I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government**. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.* *For those who ask the question, \"Aren't you a civil rights leader?\" and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: **\"To save the soul of America.\"** We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear.* - Dr. King, \"*Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence*,\" 1967 In the last year of his life, Dr. King had plans to move into mainstream politics as a [presidential candidate with pediatrician and anti-war activist Dr. Benjamin Spock](https://www.carolinajournal.com/how-a-nc-professor-almost-built-a-king-spock-presidential-ticket/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Spock%2C%20the%20two%20never,interventionism%20and%20promote%20democratic%20socialism.).

The focus was to bring people together nationwide, highlighting the importance of an anti-poverty and anti-war agenda that would radically shift American society from a \"thing-oriented society\" powered by weapons and machines to a person-oriented society born out of freedom and equality. King dreamed of a global society of peace and cooperation, where the forces and conditions that give rise to war would be eliminated. **He envisioned a movement that would activate a deeper consciousness in activism and politics. **His position on war was a natural extension of the civil rights struggle. As King once said, \"*A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom*.\" The hefty cost of the war required that essential social services and programs in American communities be cut, disproportionately impacting low-income people and communities of color. In addressing freedom and inequality, he began passionately organizing the Poor People's Campaign project, which would involve a tent city of hundreds of thousands of America's most marginalized and underserved communities occupying the Washington Monument. They would remain for as long as it took Congress to take action on restoring social welfare programs. King's actions attracted negative attention from powerful interests. They were threatened by his unifying and empowering message. These interests included politicians, government agents, oil companies, military contractors and multinational banks that all profited lavishly from the war machine and economic inequality. *When one assesses the awesome array of privately established, nongovernmental, institutional power, it is eminently reasonable to consider those in government decision-making positions as being compelled to listen to, protect, and serve the unified interest of this corporate establishment. * **When business speaks with one voice, as it did in respect to the war or the purported extreme threat of war, at the time when Dr. King set himself up in opposition, the relevant government agencies and their officials became mere foot soldiers for the mighty economic interests. ** Out in front during war are the armed forces and the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Not far behind are the executive, the legislative, and the judicial legitimizers, who sanction the necessary action. Following in line are the media conglomerates, who as the publicists of government policy, though posing as independent voices of the people, vigorously support and defend the official policy in those serious national security instances of significant concern to the corporate establishment. - Dr. Pepper, excerpt from *Plot To Kill King* Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and official documents from the House Select Committee report on his assassination revealed a coordinated effort within law enforcement,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination.txt:2:438d0bf2605e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10418, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "who sanction the necessary action.

Convinced he was a Communist, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had a [particular obsession](https://www.history.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr-fbi-j-edgar-hoover-communism) with taking down King and the larger civil rights movement. Following King's powerful speech \"Beyond Vietnam,\" [168 newspapers attacked him](https://www.npr.org/2010/03/30/125355148/the-story-of-kings-beyond-vietnam-speech). Hoover once told a group of reporters at a Washington news conference that King was \"the most notorious liar in the country.\" His efforts intensified, [ordering](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-documentary-finds-contemporary-echoes-fbis-persecution-martin-luther-king-jr) the wire-tapping of King's phone lines, bugging his home and hotel rooms, and sending informants to infiltrate his inner circle. *Scores of ranking officials and agents at the F.B.I., dozens of elected officials and several informants embedded in King's inner circles knew what was going on, and none, as far as the public records indicate, blew a whistle on the campaign.* - Excerpt from *New York Times*, [The Man Who Knew Exactly What the F.B.I. Was Doing to Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--man-who-knew-exactly-what-fbi-was-doing-martin-luther-king-jr) Soon after Hoover began his vicious surveillance campaign against King, [a blackmail letter was sent](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-burglars-who-took-fbi-abandon-shadows) to King along with a tape allegedly recording King's extramarital affairs. According to [Senate investigations in 1975](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html), a draft of the letter was found in the files of William Sullivan, who was head of the FBI's domestic intelligence division. **[The letter denounced him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/13/an-old-letter-sheds-light-on-fbis-malice-toward-martin-luther-king-jr/) as a \"a colossal fraud . . . and a dissolute, abnormal moral imbecile ...

The National Security Agency (NSA) was [also involved](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-nsa-spied-martin-luther-king-documents-reveal) in spying on King and drawing up \"watch lists\" and wire-tapping phone calls of those opposing the Vietnam War. Even the intelligence branch of the United States Army [spied on King and his family](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html) for three generations. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Center for National Security Studies exposed a little-known CIA division known as the Office of Security (OS), which focused heavily on Dr. King during the 60s and had a strong working relationship with Hoover of the FBI. The OS coordinated a wide range of operations. This included assassination efforts, as illustrated in a [declassified government document](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10213-10101.pdf) revealing OS collaboration with organized crime in attempts to [assassinate Fidel Castro](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--cia-schemes-kill-castro--with-seashell). **[Operation CHAOS and Project RESISTANCE](https://downloads.paperlessarchives.com/p/vc6p/) were covert CIA programs that also engaged in collecting domestic surveillance on protesters, antiwar groups, and individuals challenging official stories.

The [Vietnam] War was a very important monetary issue for major American corporations. **You know; at one point, John Downie, who was head of the military intelligence group, the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, used to brief President Johnson, on a very regular basis. And every time he would come back from Vietnam, he would brief him. And he would ask him: \"Why are we there? Why are we losing blood and treasure? What's behind all of this? What is the reason for it? It doesn't make any sense.\" And Johnson would ignore him for the most part.

The official story of King's murder was that there was no CIA or FBI involvement, and that James Earl Ray was a lone racist gunman. Yet [questions lingered](https://compactmag.com/article/did-the-fbi-kill-mlk), especially when Ray [filed a motion to withdraw his plea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/30/who-killed-martin-luther-king-jr-his-family-believes-james-earl-ray-was-framed/) days after his sentence, claiming he had been framed by his attorney and the FBI. Ray never had a fair trial, and Pepper was convinced of Ray's innocence. He continued to investigate the case even after Ray died. In 1999, Pepper and the King family filed a civil action in Memphis against a man who admitted he was involved: Loyd Jowers, owner of a restaurant near where King was assassinated. Jowers would later admit to being part of the conspiracy to kill King, and he would be found responsible for the killing, along with various government agencies. *The King v. Jowers civil trial ... went on for 30 days with some 70 witnesses. It was not covered by the media. Because of the degree of media control in matters of this sort, very few people know that trial took place. But it did. **And it took a jury 59 minutes to find that James Earl Ray had no involvement, knowing involvement, in the killing.**\"* - Excerpt from [an interview with Dr. Pepper](https://archives.kpfa.org/data/20170407-Fri1300.mp3) on [The Project Censored Radio Show](https://www.projectcensored.org/radio/) **Pepper's compelling investigation points to a conspiracy to silence King's growing criticism of the Vietnam War and his anti-poverty campaign by Hoover, elements within the military and intelligence agencies, the Memphis Police Department, and Mafia crime figures.** As revealed in a [transcript of an ABC News PrimeTime Live program interview](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol10.html#p1380\" target=) with Jowers, which was read to the jury in the Memphis courtroom, Jowers admitted that Ray did not kill King and that he was involved in a conspiracy. **Jowers alleged the gunman was a Memphis police officer who fired from the bushes behind the grill,** then handed Jowers the murder weapon. Jowers stashed the rifle behind the bar and said it was later picked up by Raul and tossed in the Mississippi River. **Leading up to King's assassination, Jowers revealed that a man asked him to help in King's murder, who was a Mafia-connected produce dealer named Frank Liberto.** [Liberto had a courier deliver $100,000](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol10.html#p1382) for Jowers to hold at his restaurant.

In the civil trial, she testified that he had been delivered a large sum of money right before the assassination. **Seconds after the gunshots, she saw him rush into the back of the grill through the back door with the rifle. He then wrapped the weapon in a tablecloth and hid it under the counter. He turned to her and said, \"Betty, you wouldn't do anything to hurt me, would you?\"** Testimonials from countless witnesses including King's driver and *New York Times* reporter Earl Caldwell described seeing the shot come from the bushes and not from the bathroom of the rooming house as the official story states. A witness testified that she heard a fireman announce to the police that \"The shot came from that clump of bushes,\" indicating the heavily overgrown brushy area facing the Lorraine and adjacent to Fire Station 2. **The next morning, Memphis public works employees cut down the bushes and destroyed a \"possible crime scene.\"** Usual special body guards provided by the Memphis police were advised they \"weren't needed\" on the day of the assassination. **Dr. King's room was also changed from a secure 1st-floor room to an exposed balcony room.** Along with sanitizing a crime scene, police abandoned the standard investigative procedure of interviewing witnesses who lived by the scene of the shooting.

And that caught her attention.So, she turned around, looked over;** and then she saw them spit on the body of Dr. King, saw Dr. Bland pull out the catheter, and take a pillow, put the pillow over his face and suffocate him.*** - Excerpt from [an interview with Dr. Pepper](https://archives.kpfa.org/data/20170407-Fri1300.mp3) on [The Project Censored Radio Show](https://www.projectcensored.org/radio/) about the 1999 civil trial **Military Involvement in King's Assassination** **Not only did the civil trial reveal that a Memphis Police officer fired the fatal shot, but two Special Forces military snipers were sent as back-ups if the primary shooter failed.** Pepper eventually tracked down these two Special Forces snipers, who he named as Murphy and Warren. Their cooperation was dependent on remaining anonymous. Warren and Murphy were both active in covert Special Operation Group (SOG) missions in Vietnam. Throughout 1967, they were involved in the highly secretive [902ndMilitary Intelligence Group (MIG) operations](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html#902), which was run by Colonel John Downie, Lyndon Johnson's former Vietnam briefer. As members of small \"Alpha team\" units for the 902nd MIG, Murphy and Warren were deployed in cities where violence was breaking out. **They were issued photographs and personal information of black radical activists who were designated as targets to be \"taken out\" if a disruption or riot broke out. ** Warren and Murphy would then participate in a Memphis Special Forces training team in civilian disguise, positioned to shoot King on top of the nearby Illinois Central Railroad Building. The two men told Pepper that their commander's \"pep talk\" involved showing pictures of King and Reverend Andrew Young, who was with King in Memphis. **It was stressed to Warren and Murphy that these men were enemies of the US and had plans to bring down the government, which would result in catastrophic results for cities if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" target=) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam%E2%80%99s_secret_wars\" target=)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination.txt:7:f9e76e734dca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10423, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__uncensored-story-behind-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" target=) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam%E2%80%99s_secret_wars\" target=)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice of infiltrating and spying on US activist groups, finding that [their surveillance](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3019&context=ilj&httpsredir=1&referer=) was both \"unauthorized and in violation of the first amendment.\" ** In 1996, Tompkins received a phone call from Colonel Downie, who found Pepper's research on the King assassination in his first book [*Orders to Kill*](https://www.amazon.com/Orders-Kill-Behind-Murder-Martin/dp/1483047415#:~:text=After%20eighteen%20years%20of%20intensive,nation's%20greatest%20civil%20rights%20leader.) \"remarkably accurate,\" yet felt that he gave Downie too much responsibility for the operation. Downie described himself as \"an officer in a chain of command following orders.\" Colonel Downie, refusing to meet with Pepper, agreed to meet with Tompkins. Downie confirmed he played a key role in coordinating the military units in Memphis during the week leading up to and on King's assassination. He also admitted that Ray was one of many people used as \"patsies\" in various covert operations. By the summer of 1997, Colonel Downie had disappeared. *We learned that the 902nd MIG was involved in a clandestine joint venture operation with Carlos Marcello's Mafia family, whereby stolen weapons from US military bases, camps, and arsenals were delivered to Marcello's property, loaded onto barges, and shipped to the Gulf at Houston, where they were off-loaded, repackaged, and sold to right-wing forces in Latin and South America. **The profits were split 50-50 between the 902nd and the mob, with the 902nd using the profits to fund further black operations. This particular operation, the assassination of Dr. King, was ... confirmed by two members of the Alpha 184 sniper team.*** - Excerpt from *Plot to Kill King* **King's Legacy** Many questions remain unanswered about the nature of the money, players, and motives behind the King assassination. Despite this unfortunate reality, King remains a powerful moral voice for our times in the wake of the endless US war machine that continues to fuel conflict and destruction worldwide. *Now, what kind of man was he? A man of enormous courage. No matter how much money it cost him, no matter how much his life became increasingly in danger, he stood firm on behalf of values, that he thought were essential human values. And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in fact, unconscionable. So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy.* - Dr. Pepper In these challenging times, there are many reasons for grief, confusion, and rage.

King wrote about these related concerns in his final book *[Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos Or Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F)*. He asserted that humankind has the resources and technology to overcome oppression and corruption. King felt that our best hope for a durable future beyond the harms and abuses of our world must be rooted in the Greek concept of *agape*, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. *Agape* is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all.\" It is the willingness to go to any length to restore community. In *Chaos or Community*, **he calls on the \"creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.\"** As a practitioner in nonviolence, he carried a deep faith in the future. His struggle for justice was accompanied by what he called a cosmic, creative force integrating the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole. May the tragic story of his murder be a sobering reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and unaccountable government. Yet more importantly, may we lead with the courage that King gracefully and fiercely role modeled for us, freeing ourselves from excessive fear and transforming \"us\" vs. \"them\" in thought and action as we work for the well-being of all. ***The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.*** - Dr. King Your financial support makes a difference.

Like the air we breathe and the water we drink, information is a public good that helps us make wise and responsible choices for ourselves and our community. However, many of our readers in the PEERS community are aware of the significant challenges facing our news media systems. In this message, we'll explore useful ways we can better navigate the media landscape. This comes at a crucial time where society is rapidly changing, and the ongoing cultural political wars fuel imbalanced reporting, censorship, and sophisticated propaganda techniques. ** A [recent Gallup poll](https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Views-2022-Pt-2-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf) revealed that half of Americans believe news organizations deceive the public**. This may not come as a surprise. Our political systems seem to increasingly feel like a theatrical show or a confusing game of charades. Our choices and voices may feel irrelevant compared to the choices and voices of those in power shaping our world and the mainstream narrative. **Who or what do we trust? ** Meanwhile, our ability to understand each other, talk to each other, and work together seems dangerously degraded. People cluster to media organizations that fit their belief, and dismiss other outlets. The internet, once thought to open the world up to all the information possible and bring people together, has instead drawn people into their own corners. Cognitive scientist and psychologist Dr. John Vervaeke calls this the Meaning Crisis, the pervasive feeling of alienation and disconnection from the world and from each other. **Vervaeke explains that a lack of meaning in life occurs when people become stuck in a rut, paralyzed by suboptimal assessments of the world such that they no longer feel like they fit into it well. **A lack of meaning makes it challenging to see beyond the boxes of our own limited thoughts and beliefs. **Each of us has the responsibility to face the world and make meaning of it in constructive ways. **Destabilization, apparent chaos, and change may initiate deeper questions that could help us uncover what's really going on. Enough events are happening in our world that are sending people on a search for meaning, whether that's from listening to podcasts, creating alternative communities, to adopting new ideas and ways of thinking. It seems as though any societal shift begins with a consciousness shift in how we think and relate to ourselves, others, and the world.

It seems as though any societal shift begins with a consciousness shift in how we think and relate to ourselves, others, and the world. The Weaving of Good Critical Thinking and Sensemaking To make better sense of the information landscape, we begin by reducing the noise inside and around us. Our society has a lot of noise. Endless opinions and biases flood both corporate and independent media platforms. Outrageous headlines and polarizing narratives weaponize our emotions, manipulating the public to take a certain side on a complex issue. Eroding quality of life makes it challenging to feel and think well, due to the degradation of our environmental, economic, and social systems fueled by corporate interests and captured government agencies. **This noise discourages our ability to emotionally regulate, see things clearly, and listen to each other.** In psychophysics, the Weber-Fechner Law states that the more noise in an environment, the less signal you hear. **A signal serves as a guiding force that gets us closer to a *felt* sense of truth about how something works. **Yet to hear the signal, we can't just rely on our intellectual capacities. **The signal is the integration of two forms of human knowledge: critical thinking and our body-based knowing.** Embodiment coach and author [Philip Shepherd](https://embodiedpresent.com/) says there are two basic modes of intelligence: mind (details, ideas, compare/contrast) and body (felt senses, intuition, subjectivity). Some of us may find that we often \"feel\" truth, not just think truth. Many call this a \"gut feeling\" where we sense that something carries truth *or* something feels off in what we're doing, even if we may not have logical information to prove it. This isn't just a metaphor. Scientists now recognize that we have two brains. In addition to the familiar cerebral brain in the head, there is a \"second brain\" in the gut that is home to the enteric nervous system, a complex network of over 100 million nerve cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. This brain, operating independently from the rest of the nervous system, sends constant, updated sensory information of our internal states to the brain via the [vagus nerve](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/vagus-nerve), which is responsible for modulating mood, relaxing tension, and maintaining homeostasis. *[Our culture] tells us that the head should be in charge, because it knows the answers, and the body is little more than a vehicle for transporting the head to its next engagement. It tells us that doing is the primary value, while being is secondary. It shapes our perceptions, actions, and experiences of life. It separates us from the sensations of the body and alienates us from the world. These cultural differences point out that we have lost some choice in how we experience ourselves. * *Our culture doesn't recognize that hub in the belly, and most of us don't trust it enough to come to rest there.

And so we are stuck in the cranium, unable to open the door to the body and join its thinking. The best we can do is put our ear to the imaginary wall separating us from it and \"listen to the body,\" a phrase that means well but actually keeps us in the head, gathering information from the outside. But the body is not outside. The body is you. We are missing the experience of our own being. * *My work is not about \"listening to the body.\"** It's about listening to the world through the body******. ***- Philip Shepherd Almost every important decision you've made was based on what you *felt* about it. Consider the friends you choose, the people you fall in love with, the values you prioritize, or even choosing a color to paint with. Our intuition and felt sense of things are often more powerful than reason. Maya Angelou's classic quote speaks precisely to this, where she says that we will often forget what others say or do, but we won't ever forget how we felt around them. Although our thoughts are responsible for solving the real problems we face, we often feel things in our bodies first. **This can be an important signal if we pay attention to it. Our instinctual felt sense of things is like a muscle we can strengthen with intentional practice. **When the head gets too involved, so often do the reactive defense systems as well, which rely on conditioned patterns that hinder us from thinking outside of the box. In a society that's diverse and rapidly changing, the ability to hold space for differences and complexity is vital to our collective future. So how do we apply this to our current media landscape? Everywhere you look, political bias infects much of mainstream and alternative media platforms. Instead of engaging in balanced inquiry about issues where we look at all sides and perspectives, we often only get one side of the story that we're told is accurate information (i.e. the rise of \"trust the science\" memes and fact-checking programs). Yet Shepherd articulates that our culture misunderstands what information is: *We are addicted to \"digital\" information. **I don't mean literally information that comes to us through digital sources, but rather information that, like a digital signal, is made up of bits and pieces broken off from the whole**. We think that's real information.*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape.txt:2:b51802aff02f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10429, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "perspectives, we often only get one side of the story that we're told is accurate information (i.e. the rise of \"trust the science\" memes and fact-checking programs).

We think that's real information.* *Ideas are seductive in their certainty and simplicity, but because any idea is a static construct, it stands independent of the present. **To give your allegiance to an idea is to turn away from the connected intelligence of your being.** I think the most dangerous people in the world are those who feel their ideas about the world more keenly than they feel the world itself, because they will be disconnected from what is in front of them and can act only out of their fantasy. **Holding fast to an idea, because it's frozen, also promises to excuse you from having to change. **But harmony requires us to change along with the whole. If you open yourself to the hum of the world - if you live in the present rather than in your idea of it - it will change you. * Whether it's buying a product or voting for a candidate, the media is always selling us on an idea, and often in polarizing ways. How do we think for ourselves and integrate the best of any message, along with our own ways of understanding? To navigate the media landscape, we have two tools: good critical thinking and sensemaking. Sensemaking involves the weaving of body-based intelligence that reduces our defenses, maintains emotional regulation, stays open to different ways of perceiving the world, and holds conflicting feelings while navigating the complex information we're getting from our media systems. Deborah Ancona, founder of the MIT Leadership Center, defines sensemaking as** **\"******creating space for listening, reflection and allowing different framings, stories and viewpoints to be shared and collectively explored.\"** The synthesis of different perspectives can create a more integrative worldview that doesn't seek to exclude or cancel any perspective. When we practice sensemaking in our media systems, **we strive to find signal in any perspective, whether it confirms our biases or challenges them. **Possibilities emerge for calm and open thinking, new insights, and effective communication. **To more easily detect the signal and reduce the noise, here are 10 approaches that weave critical thought and sensemaking. ** 1. **Slow down and breathe.** Noticing where and why we get defensive or emotionally activated can greatly reduce the noise. The more regulated our nervous system is, the less we're pulled into the divisive, emotional narratives and dramas flooding our media systems.

[Read their brilliant write-up](https://thepulse.one/a-new-media-approach-for-improved-sense-making-through-physiological-coherence/) on why this supports our ability to synthesize information into meaningful practice, solutions, and actions steps. 2. **Read, view, and listen to a diverse range of news sources to expand your media diet. **Notice what resonates with you without getting stuck in any echo chamber. A healthy diet is a diverse one; any one food eaten exclusively creates imbalance. 3.** Foreground curiosity and inquiry.** Instead of fixating on answers, notice something you haven't noticed before in yourself or what you're listening to. Asking questions builds connections and relationships where there were none, and increases the signal in *all* perspectives. Exploring conflicting views only adds, not subtracts, to the bigger picture. As David Rumelhart says, \"*all knowledge is in the connections.*\" 4. **Become more comfortable with looking at perspectives you may not agree with.** It's not our differences that divide us; it's the judgments about our differences that do. Judgment alone narrows our thinking. Instead of shutting down, we *slow things down* to bring greater, humble awareness of how our own biases and emotional states cloud our capacity to sit with conflicting information. As Philip Shepherd notes, *\"When you stand back to look at something, there are always details that are hidden from you.\"* 5. **Follow the money and power in corporate media. **Six corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read. [Becoming aware of the special interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgKv8rrqIpU) driving what gets covered (or not) on mainstream platforms can help us navigate censorship, propaganda and mis/disinformation campaigns that serve corporate interests over open, democratic debate. 6. **Support independent journalism. **Independent media platforms that aren't owned or influenced by corporate interests often provide ample opportunities to access a broad spectrum of perspectives and voices. [Click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/independent-news-links/) for a comprehensive list of independent media sources. 7. **Be mindful of the overuse of the negativity bias. **The human nervous system has been evolving for 600 million years to avoid hazards and stay alive. This biological and psychological response is known as the \"negativity bias\" in which our minds and behavior are shaped by threats, real or unreal. **Media narratives, often influenced by government and corporate special interests, can use powerful emotions of fear and anger to manipulate the public for their own benefit **by: 1) highlighting concern about a problem to help sell a remedy that they can profit", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape.txt:4:db59cbd3a727", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10431, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "system has been evolving for 600 million years to avoid hazards and stay alive.

Propagandists often use loaded words and name-calling to disparage any opposition to their message and sway public opinion (i.e. derogatory labels, discrediting or scapegoating those who question their narrative). 8.** Take in the good.** Teilhard de Chardin states that *\"the future belongs to those who give the next generation reason for hope.\"* Just as our negativity bias has helped us survive, foregrounding [stories and news that inspire](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) remind us of human goodness, and fosters collaboration and collective power. Emphasizing the good can literally [rewire our brain](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/taking_in_the_good) to internalize positive experiences and heal negative ones, thus enhancing our resilience in the face of societal challenges. 9. **Integrate the arts, whether on a self-care or activist level. ** Art stimulates all of our senses and sparks full-body participation, shifting our role from passive participant into active creator. **Activism moves the material world, while art moves the heart, body and soul. **A [touching article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123197292128083217) explores how jazz helped fuel the civil rights movement, bringing people of all skin colors to engage together on the dance floor without effort or force. From [reviving singing in social movements](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/12/04/why-our-movements-need-start-singing-again) to [designing safer streets with art](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/safer-streets-painted-intersections-crosswalk-art/), art is inherently nonviolent and emphasizes creativity, play, and community. 10.**Invite respectful dialogue.** We can't make sense of our times alone. Sensemaking usually involves more than one person. Others may have views that open up different insights, and each of us can serve as that person for others too in reducing groupthink and conformity occurring on all sides of the political spectrum.

Victim or Creator? Do You Choose to Be a Victim or a Creator? **It's What You Do With It ** It is not what happens to each of us that determines how much we enjoy life, but rather our reaction to what happens. Though we may have no choice in unexpected events like COVID that happen to us, we most certainly have choice in how we interpret what happens, and in what we choose to do about it. Even in these intensely polarized times, we can always choose to be either a victim or a creator. This key choice can make all the difference in how much joy we experience in life. Think about it. What we own doesn't play a major role in how much we enjoy life. One person with all the money and possessions in the world may have a miserable life, while another in the lowest income bracket may absolutely love their life. It is what we do with what we own that affects our level of satisfaction and joy in life. **It's not what you possess or what happens to you in life that matters, but rather what you do with it.** Each of us is faced with challenges every day of our lives, some more intense than others. And with each challenge, we make choices in how we react. By choosing to become more conscious of how we react to challenges, we can shift our actions towards creating what we really want in our lives. Rather than following habitual, reactive patterns which cause us to behave like victims, we can recognize and transform old habits to create the life we really want. Yet to do this, we must first find the courage to look at some of the disempowering, often [unconscious patterns](http://www.momentoflove.org/coreissue) which cause us to play the victim role, and then choose instead to empower the creator in ourselves. **Transform Yourself From Victim to Creator ** You are given many opportunities in life to choose to be a victim or to be a creator. **When you choose to be a victim, the world is a cold and harsh place.** \"They\" did things to you which caused all of your pain and suffering. Whether it's Bill Gates, Fauci, or Trump, \"they\" are wrong and bad. Life is rotten as long as \"they\" are around. \"They\" might also be one or more individuals in your family or community. It might be those corrupt politicians or your boss or the evil cabal of the power elite that rules the world. Or you may blame yourself for all your problems, thus internalizing your victimization.

And the truth is, your life is likely to stay that way as long as you feel a need to blame and make yourself or others wrong. Those who choose to be creators look at life quite differently. They know there are powerful individuals and groups who might like to control their lives, but they don't let this get in the way. They know they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. **Creators feel no need to blame anyone as they know that whatever happens, they have choice in the matter.** When Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. were put behind bars, they used that opportunity to meditate and pray, to write letters and books, and to inspire their communities to stand up and make a difference in the world. They prayed not only for themselves and their supporters, but even for those who jailed them and despised their work. They were unstoppable, powerful creators who continued to have joy and meaning in their lives until the day they died. Victims relish in anger, revenge, guilt, and other emotions and behaviors that cause others - and even themselves - to feel like victims, too. Creators consciously choose [love, inspiration, empowerment](http://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#love), and other qualities which inspire not only themselves, but all around them to continually create the lives and world they want to live in. Victims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same physical realities, yet their experience of life is worlds apart. From the perspective of enjoyment of life, they hardly live in the same world. Yet whether they know it or not, both victim and creator always have choice in each moment to determine the direction of their lives through what they choose to do with what they are given. **In reality, all of us play the victim and all of us play the creator at various points in our lives.** Yet few people realize just how much choice we have in which role we play at any given time. One person, on losing a job or a special relationship, may feel as if it is the end of the world and sink into terrible suffering for months, years, or even a lifetime.

None of us is perfect. We all have made and will continue to make mistakes and bad choices in our lives. When we fail, there is no need to blame ourselves or anyone else. We can choose to simply accept that we didn't do what we had intended and then [work to understand why](http://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance), so that we might do better the next time. Notice when you find yourself blaming yourself or the evil cabal. Then stop for a moment. Take a look inside and ask, is it really empowering you to place blame, even if you believe it is very well deserved? Is this really how you want to live, or is there something better and more fulfilling? There will most certainly be times where you slip back into your old victim ways. But by continually reminding yourself of your intention to be a creator, you can transform your life. For those who blame themselves more than others, consider exploring how this serves you. Some are drawn to abusive relationships or habits as a way of unconsciously punishing themselves. Many times deep, unconscious processes are behind this behavior which can be uncovered by setting a strong intention to understand the root causes, and by holding to a deep intention to transform the places which keep you from being a powerful creator. Shifting from victim to creator does not mean shifting the blame from yourself to others, but it may mean getting out of abusive relationships or habits so that you can then move with greater awareness and commitment to create positive transformation in your own life and in those around you.

At times in this process, you will look back and realize that you let yourself be the victim again. **Even when you fail at making the shift from victim to creator, you can be gentle with yourself.** Judging and blaming yourself is just as disempowering as directing it towards others. You can accept and forgive yourself for not following your intention, and then do your best to learn from what happened. And there may even be times when, for whatever reason, you feel a need to play the role of victim for a while. If so, get into it and play the role fully. But remember while doing so that you are choosing this, and that you can just as easily choose to be a creator again as soon as you are ready. There's a time and place for everything. One common trap which easily pulls people into victim mode is attachment. When we are strongly attached to anything, the possibility of suffering and loss is magnified. When the victim loses something to which they are attached, they easily become depressed or angry and blame others or themselves for what happened. When creators realize they had attachment to something lost, they remember the transformative power of letting go and work to understand and then release the attachment. One of their [key life intentions](http://www.momentoflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is to experience each precious moment of life to its fullest, without the need for the security provided by attachment. They know that even the most difficult experiences can be powerful teachers for us if we allow them to. By accepting the past and allowing the future to be a great, unknown, infinite potential, creators trust that even in the midst of something like an intense pandemic, their dance with each sacred moment of life is a gift. They know that in the long run, every experience can bring more meaning and deeper connection. They understand that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. **Creators also know that by choosing to [nurture and inspire](http://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#nurturance) all around them to shift from victim to creator, life becomes better not only for themselves, but for all whose lives they touch. **You can have a fuller, richer life right now by setting a clear intention to transform the victim within, and by inviting and welcoming into your life the powerful creator that you are. **For an excellent, inspiring 15-minute video", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__victim_or_creator_covid.txt:3:77f92a0a7fd8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10437, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__victim_or_creator_covid.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__victim_or_creator_covid", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. **Creators also know that by choosing to [nurture and inspire](http://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#nurturance) all around them to shift from victim to creator, life becomes better not only for themselves, but for all whose lives they touch. **You can have a fuller, richer life right now by setting a clear intention to transform the victim within, and by inviting and welcoming into your life the powerful creator that you are. **For an excellent, inspiring 15-minute video with a similar message, [click here](http://personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell) For an empowering essay on transforming your core life challenges, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/coreissue) For a highly inspiring online lesson bringing this all home, [click here](http://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a)**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__victim_or_creator_covid.txt:4:df3c8ae0ba79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10438, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__victim_or_creator_vs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__victim_or_creator_vs", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Victim or Creator?

What inspiring news!!! Yet notice how little media attention this has drawn. A number of years ago, I came across a major media article stating violent crime rates were on the decline. Given all of the violence reported in the news every day, I was amazed and somewhat skeptical. To verify the claim, I searched for and found the FBI's webpage listing [cumulative crime statistics](https://web.archive.org/web/20120317073714/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/viortrdtab.cfm). I was most surprised to find that not only were violent crime rates steadily declining over the previous 17 years, the cumulative decline was huge! What great news!!! Yet I was also fascinated that the article I read didn't mention the extent of this decline. So ever since, I've followed this topic with great interest. And the rates continued to decline until around 2015 when they leveled out. Yet as I search the news, every year I find a only a few major media articles which state that crime has decreased for a certain year or few years. **I've only found one major media article which talked about violent crime being at the lowest rate in 40 years, and even that article failed to mention that the overall violent crime rate has dropped to 1/3 of what it was 17 years prior to publication date.** That [one article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24crime.html) was from the *New York Times* on May 23, 2011. Yet this article, too, seemed to downplay the great news with a title that was far from inspiring, \"Steady Decline in Major Crime Baffles Experts.\" But at least this one report laid out some of the astounding statistics: \"The number of violent crimes in the United States dropped significantly last year, to what appeared to be the lowest rate in nearly 40 years. In all regions, the country appears to be safer. The odds of being murdered or robbed are now less than half of what they were in the early 1990s, when violent crime peaked in the United States. Small towns, especially, are seeing far fewer murders: In cities with populations under 10,000, the number plunged by more than 25 percent last year.\" The author of this article used the words \"appeared to be the lowest rate,\" and \"the country appears to be safer.\" When this information is based on FBI statistics, why does he water down this most inspiring news by using the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__violent_crime_rates_reduction.txt:0:fde384d402ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10443, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__violent_crime_rates_reduction.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__violent_crime_rates_reduction", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "what they were in the early 1990s, when violent crime peaked in the United States.

And the FBI statistics actually show that the odds of being [murdered](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/rob.cfm) or [robbed](http://web.archive.org/web/20100129085525/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/rob.cfm) are not just \"less than half,\" but actually one-third of what they were in the early 1990s. Here are a few articles I've collected which show the lack of reporting of this most inspiring news: June 1, 2009: *USA Today/*AP - [FBI: U.S. crime falls, but small town violence up](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-06-01-fbi-report_N.htm) Sept. 14, 2010: *Boston Globe/*AP - [Crime rate decline puzzles theorists](http://articles.boston.com/2010-09-14/news/29300139_1_violent-crime-property-crime-james-alan-fox) June 11, 2012: *Washington Post/*AP - [FBI says violent crime fell 4 percent last year; but has long downward trend hit bottom?](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-says-violent-crime-fell-4-percent-last-year-but-has-long-downward-trend-hit-bottom) Nov. 10, 2014: *Chicago Tribun*e - [FBI: Violent crime drops, reaches 1970s level](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-violent-crime-drops-reaches-1970s-level) Sept. 28, 2015: CNN News - [FBI report: Violent crime down in U.S.](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-report-violent-crime-down-us) Notice the *USA Today* headline even waters down the inspiring news by focusing on where violence is up. And the title of a [*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/us/crime-rates-fall-again-but-decline-may-slow.html) from the year 2000 is further evidence of a negative bias: \"Crime Rates Fall Again, but Decline May Slow,\" when it did not slow at all. **Why aren't the media reporting this amazing reduction in crime in top headlines to inspire people?** No one seems to know why crime has been declining so steadily. One reason may be that as the baby boomers are aging, the percentage of young adults has declined. Another is that due to tougher sentencing laws, prison numbers are way up. [2.2 million Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States) are now behind bars. That's about one percent of the adult population and [more than any other nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States), including China. And it's possible that email and the Internet are helping people to feel more connected and less likely to want to harm others. Or it could be potential criminals now spend most of the time looking at their cell phones. All of these factors and more may play a role in the decline. **No matter what the reason, let's celebrate this great news!

It's called \"Crowdsourcing.\" This process uses a kind of group think to better formulate documents and ideas in a variety of settings. You can see a good Wikipedia article on this at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing). **Crowdsourcing is the process that made Wikipedia one of the 10 most popular websites on the Internet.** Many thousands of people are engaged in building this gigantic knowledge base using a clear set of rules and using the \"Wiki\" software which provides an ever-developing end product. A discussion page for each article allows developers to discuss and debate over the text until consensus is reached, or until satisfactory notes are included as references that point to the various differences of opinions. Using this type of collaborative process, the fabulous work of WantToKnow.info could be greatly enhanced by those of us who wish to help. Though many hundreds of people have contributed to making WantToKnow.info what it is today, the vast majority of editing has been done by WTK manager Fred Burks. Fred would be thrilled to have any interested help to take WantToKnow.info to the next level through using our group think capabilities. Here is how we plan to get started with this. Thanks to the inspiring suggestion of a great supporter, Stan P., **we've now set up a special wiki just for WantToKnow.info using a model very similar to Wikipedia.** In this new wiki, anyone who is given permission to join can edit WantToKnow.info articles there, just as in Wikipedia. Anyone who has the time and editing skills and who is willing to collaborate with others is welcome to join. All who join can read and follow the behind the scenes discussions for each article, too. Before we start editing WantToKnow.info articles, a group of us might initially choose to examine and actually improve some topic in Wikipedia for practice. We could join the existing community there to study how things work in sufficient depth, so as to understand how the community of people working on an article interact with each other. Any who already have experience with editing wikis would also be more than welcome to coach others and work together with Stan P., who has volunteered to be the initial manager of our wiki. Once a group of us understand how Wikipedia works, we can turn our attention to deciding how to use the ideas we learned to further the process of creating and improving WantToKnow.info documents. The documents we create don't need to look or be anything like Wikipedia documents, but the process of learning to build them together as a collaborative process can result in giving the work of WantToKnow.info a huge boost. The wiki we've set up for WantToKnow.info has a special page", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__wanttoknow_wiki.txt:0:a54d2d2e5a50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10446, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__wanttoknow_wiki.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__wanttoknow_wiki", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "group of us understand how Wikipedia works, we can turn our attention to deciding how to use the ideas we learned to further the process of creating and improving WantToKnow.info documents.

The wiki we've set up for WantToKnow.info has a special page describing the criteria used for writing and editing on our website. It also contains links for people new to wikis to learn how to edit and create pages. **Even those who are not familiar with wikis can join in. All that's required is some writing skill, time, and desire to make a difference in our world.** As we set this up, we are quite aware that WantToKnow.info is monitored by some who do not support our work. Mention is made in our wiki that we expect there will be a few who join in this endeavor whose intention is to disrupt our work. Any who are found to be intentionally disruptive or divisive will have their access to the wiki removed. We may eventually need to develop a further set of guidelines to avoid this and other problems, and to further support the kind of work we're doing. Yet we have little doubt that all of this in the end will enhance our ability to work together. Once we're ready to actually begin the editing process, we've already picked a couple topics to start with as a trial run. We'll add more once we see how this progresses. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 is only a year away, we're starting with our two-page and 10-page summaries of 9/11. These summaries, though still quite good, are somewhat outdated and can be significantly improved with your help. We also have a 10-page banking summary for which we'd like to create a more concise two-page version. Using the conversation tabs on the webpages for these documents, we can look at what's being done by interested editors, study how people are working on them together, and make suggestions as we finally begin the actual editing. **By working together from the start, we can have effective collaboration and develop a quality product together.** This new project will need a number of key people to help. The idea man behind this new Wiki, Stan P., will be the initial manager. Stan has volunteered to instigate, but doesn't have the time to oversee or coordinate all of the research and writing we hope to do. He will coordinate giving access to the wiki and the initial investigation of this process. Yet we particularly welcome any who have experience with wikis to take leadership roles in this and coordinate with Stan.

Though Fred will occasionally monitor the wiki, Stan will be the overall manager until one or more people with more time and skill take on this role. Note that as the WantToKnow.info manager, Fred will have the final say on what gets posted to the website, at least until the process is well established. With this new wiki we hope build a effective process which can be incorporated into WantToKnow.info, so that eventually it will become much more of a group collaborative effort in which all who have some time, interest, and skill are welcome.

What Color is Your Skin? Dear friends, How often do you think about the color of your skin? As a white man, I very rarely think about it. Yet I know that the color of a person's skin can make a huge difference. For all I wish I was color blind, I notice how judgment and even prejudice sometimes sneaks into my thoughts when I meet a black person or other person of color. This despite the fact that I've had many wonderful friends and colleagues of color over the years. I have a powerful invitation for you along these lines. **This week while driving my RV across the hot, but colorful desert of southern Arizona, I listened to what ended up being the most profound and educational podcast I've ever listened to. ** \"Warriors in the Garden\" is a beautiful and vulnerably compiled episode of \"This American Life\" focused on the lives of three black men who were profoundly changed by the police killings last year. They chose to become activists. Once they took action to peacefully make a difference, all three went through some truly harrowing experiences and ended up in three very different places. Particularly if you care about understanding some of the very unexpected and extremely disheartening experiences that can occur simply by living with black skin, I invite you not to miss this incredibly moving 60-minute episode which can be accessed free of charge at: **[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/733/warriors-in-the-garden](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/733/warriors-in-the-garden)** **Why are most white people afraid to ask and sometimes even to consider what it's like to grow up black in America.** Are you willing to ask those questions? Are you willing to hear a \"no\" if a black friend declines to talk about it? Are you willing to really listen if the answer is \"yes\"? I've made it a habit most of my life of asking my black friends what it's like to grow up black. Most have been happy to share their experiences, and I've learned a tremendous amount from this. Yet the above presentation took it to a whole new level for me. I'm deeply grateful to the producers and protagonists for creating this most profound podcast. Parts of the above episode are disturbing. Yet consider how just being black can lead to many disturbing experiences, as is so clearly shown in this piece. I hope you are willing to take in this incredible taste of the challenges of being black in America. As a balance to the intensity of the above video and only after giving yourself time to integrate what you learned and experienced, I invite you to enjoy a different kind of intensity by watching incredible daredevils balancing on thin webbing while walking across yawning chasms in unbelievable feats of skill and courage. **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxPBaWDpV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxPBaWDpV8) - The Slackline Guys** (10 min.)

German guy 12/15/2004 12:09 am EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks Thank you for your many comments, some of which are extremely intelligent with good observations and others which are quite funny. I must drive to meet some people in Frankfurt today and meet with a friend who still works at the American Consulate in the Siesmayerstrasse. (I was once a very good friend of Douglas Kramer, a Clinton appointee who was Vice Consul in 1997.) I will get back to you later today and add some more about the CIA plans for Europe. It is very important that readers, whether they are ordinary American citizens or members of the US intelligence services, realise that it would be extremely foolhardy to plan staged \"terrorist\" attacks against European centres of population. German guy 12/15/2004 12:31 am EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks Yes, there is of course a lot of collaboration between the British and American services that gives rise to concern. Firstly, it is important to draw a distinction between the ordinary and dedicated employees of the agencies at the lower and middle levels, and those in senior positions who are not really interested in national security, but long-term power politics. The British invest heavily in power politics because they have an agenda that cannot be supported by their military. Instead, they use the American military to achieve these goals. In fact, if the truth was known, many Americans would be horrified to learn that the American military serves the interests of the British and Israelis first and American interests last. Tony Blair is not really a prime minister in the democratic sense. He is a rubber-stamped (by the people) Crown place-man who is really the prime minister of the City of London, which is the centre of the Anglo-Saxon financial and political empire. German guy 12/15/2004 12:52 am EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks I don ́t think the German people would tolerate a desire to take back former colonies as we are very opposed to such discredited imperial politics.

This is it, folks Dml, I ́m not familiar with the prophet of whom you speak but I have read about other prophecies made many years ago that have come to nothing. At the moment in Germany we have severe economic problems and this is likely to last for some years to come. In fact, there is so little money in the public purse that the government is thinking of abolishing compulsory miltary service (young people may also opt for civil service if they are pacifists). We have a very small standing army and cuts are to be made here too. There are also constitutional factors which would prevent an aggressive foreign policy. No political party that I know of (not even the far right) supports the idea of imperialism. People are too concerned with unemployment and cuts in social spending. German guy 12/15/2004 1:36 am EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks Yes, the cities that are mentioned most as sites for nuclear detonation are Houston, Dallas and Atlanta. In Europe, we have computed multiple references to Frankfurt, Paris, Munich and Berlin (Frankfurt is at the top of the CIA/Mossad \"hit list\"). A lot of this chatter can be accessed by intercepting the Echelon system, the raw information output of which is processed by the NSA in America and the Royal Signals in Britain (as a sidepoint, the Echelon system is no longer reliable or efficient because it doesn ́t use intelligent algorithms). What I rely on is good old-fashioned telephony interception, but on a software platform that unencrypts communications between the various US military installations and CIA stations dotted around Europe. Also, the best intelligence you have is another long-forgotten system called \"human contact\"! Yes, taking briefings from the intelligence community direct (on an informal off-duty basis, of course). The Israelis are very good at selling software-based intelligence systems but I have never had much faith in their objectivity (on the human side). The Russians are progressing rapidly in this area and many agency people I know are extremely impressed with their communication robots (they are like software vacuum cleaners that suck up information from electronic communications, but are in Russia much more advanced than the \"dumb\" Echelon", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:germanguy.txt:2:839033baf66b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10456, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "germanguy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "germanguy", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the intelligence community direct (on an informal off-duty basis, of course).

If I only have time to answer one before I travel to Frankfurt, I shall try to address the others when I return. To 9-11. I personally (and many within the German intelligence services) believe that 9-11 was an internal operation planned and executed by an extreme pro-Israel faction within the American government and intelligence services. The technicalities evident in both planning, timing and precision flying point to the use of technologies not available to so-called terrorist groups. We believe that the relationship between the so-called al-Qaeda group (really the Muslim Brotherhood which is financed by the British) and the Israeli intelligence services is very complicated, but there is an alliance of convenience. We ran a personality profile on some of the alleged hijackers, analysed handwriting and applied linguistic methodologies, and thus believe that Atta was a Mossad asset. There is also an enabling aspect on the part of the Pakistani intelligence services, which is a clone of the CIA. Yesterday Musharraf told your media that he had done everything possible to destroy the Taliban enclave in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is a lie. Neither the Americans nor the Pakistanis have any intention of breaking the Afghan rebel forces, as they will need them to become more extreme and regain the coüntry at a future date. I think it would be very interesting to see Osama bin Laden and Mr Wolfowitz in a room together privately, for I am sure they would kiss each other on the cheeks as brothers under the skin with roughly the same general project, though sharply divergent goals. German guy 12/15/2004 2:25 am EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks I have ofetn heard my American friends remark with surprise that Germans are not \"controlled\", as they thought. By NWO I think you are referring to the \"new world order\" system Bush Senior spoke of during the first Gulf War.

There is no central computer that links all of the various departments. (It is a different matter if you are seen as a threat to the constitution, and that matter is dealt with by your local state and not by the federal authorities.) As yet we do not have a biometric ID system, although that may happen in the future following approval from the European Parliament. This has been forced on us by the American government. Nobody in Germany is enthusiastic about this development, but if you travel to America regularly, you will not get entry permission after October 2005 without biometric data in your passport. I have not heard about Satan appearing on any ID card. You can however see such things by folding various international paper currency in a certain way, so I think it has more to do with imagined demons than any deliberate symbolism. If there is a continuing move to a world order of concentrated power, then this would rely first on the destruction of the American people and the American system of government. This is already happening in the United States and the biggest culprits are to be found in the American government itself. It seems that a grouping of international corporate entities and financial institutions have decided that America at this late stage is only good for projecting military force, and so it will use up American resources to advance its own agenda until there is not much left of American power and credibility. At the geopolitical level there are only two main beneficiaries: Israel and the City of London (Israel will then be destroyed by the CoL and international corporate power groups). At the financial-imperial level, the major corporations and institutions involved in the bleeding away of American military power have little to lose, since all of them have sufficient assets outside of US territories and would survive the collapse of the United States as a global power. So if this is what you mean by a world order, then you are correct. It will not be a global system of control connived by nation states, but rather by corporate and financial entities (who already enjoy enormous power and influence at all levels in all countries).

I shall have to answer other questions when I return later today. I have just returned from Frankfurt and need to brew some coffee before progressing with this discussion (fortunately my head is full of English as I have spent most of the day with some old American friends). Firstly I would like to comment on what John Doe wrote: Quote You can believe the \"German Guy\". I have another cloak-and-dagger pseudonymn to add the roster. John Doe. I operate under the auspices of CSIS. Bewteen 2000 and 2001, I was attached to the Organisierte Kriminalität under the BND. We were investigating Mossad ha-Mossad le-Modiin ule-Tafkidim Meyuhadim connections to Muslim-based terrorist cells in Hamburg and Düsseldorf. In September of 2001 just as we were closing in on a Mossad agent, the operation was shut down by order from Pullach. All agents were reassigned. I was sent back to Ottawa - and then later reassigned to Canadian Consulate in Bejing. But while attached to the BND, I did overhear some intel chatter regarding late December, 2004. Although only bits and pieces (sound byte here and there - which I ́ve been formally trained to decipher when in a framed context), it appears to relate to a multi-intel-agency operation involving a number of Western governments, including the CIA which initiated the op. Target unknown. Weapon and delivery system unknown. However, the operation has been named as ́Feuerball ́ by the BND. German for fireball. As my connections to the BND have been severed and I have no formal working relationship with CIA (only lower level FBI), there ́s not much I can offer. Hopefully the German insider may pass along some more sound bytes as the time is nearing closer. Unquote I retired shortly before the operation you mentioned. I take it you would have been part of a three-way operation since the local state Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz (Agency for the Protection of the Constitution) likes to stick its bureaucratic nose in wherever it can :-) Yes, Sir, welcome to the world of politically compromised intelligence with first-class operatives let down by poor management structures. No small coincidence that Mossad was on the receiving end. This was not the main reason I took early retirement (mainly my health) but it was a big consideration. Mossad has committed a large number of crimes in Germany and we have been able to prove it. But our political masters always prevent us from finishing the job. You may have heard about Uwe Barschel who ran foul of Mossad? Murder made to look like suicide that was a classic Kidon killing.

Or the Free Democrat leader Jürgen Möllemann who suffered an unfortunate accident when his parachute failed to open? (Strange that he had begun to develop an outspoken criticism of Israel ́s West Bank policies!) Now the Metsada in Israel are directing their Katsa operatives (or Sayan helpers) to stir up muslims in Germany, hoping to provoke tensions and ill feelings between the communities, which is a shame because we have very good mixed culture relations here. You are probably correct in identifying the codename ́Feuerball ́ or similar to the anticipated next wave of \"terrorist\" activity, although I cannot confirm that personally. There exists at present some rivalry between Pullach and the BND presence in Berlin (I was against the move to Berlin and was quite outspoken on that) and they even have rival codewords for the same projects. I still keep in touch with some of my colleagues and we continue to swap notes (over a beer or several :-), and I still have good contacts to some Americans I used to work with. Furthermore I work as a hobbyist with an old partner who is a technical computer genius and we network with other retired or resigned BND service personnel. Let me tell you what we fear most - and this comes out of our intercepts. We do not fear so-called Arab \"terrorists\". We fear Mossad and we fear some of the groups that work on the far side of the CIA. Mr Rumsfeld once explained his \"mad dog\" theory of international posturing, saying that an unpredicatble America would be an America respected out of fear. Well he is wrong. Because after a while the unpredictability becomes eminently predictable and all vanishes into thin air. German guy 12/15/2004 5:19 pm EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks I spent some years in London, so I think I can say I have a good grasp of the English language. Someone following John Doe asked me about technology and what fruits they have produced. The technology I and my partner use is a mixture of intercepts that break encrypted channels (including wireless) between military and intelligence stations (Israeli, British, American, Pakistani and others) and web bot programmes based on advanced analysis of Hebrew (including known code words and phrases), Hebrew dialects (Yiddish etc), all the permutations of Arabic with regional dialects, as ell as the same for other middle and south east nations.

(As I said, the best intelligence is \"human intel\": direct contact with people who have an important story to tell in confidence.) Though I cannot give you precise details on any of the cases I worked on while under my employment contract up to 1999, I can say (because this has already been admitted at a senior government level, albeit without any mention in the US media) that we knew about the planned 9-11 attacks three months before they occurred and we warned the American government twice. They chose to ignore us. Because of our intelligence findings, there is not one government in Europe that believes the official version handed down to the American people. That includes Tony Blair, Mr Bush ́s staunchest ally. Every prime minister and every president within the EU (and most not in the EU) knows that 9-11 was an internal operation, and though their intelligence services have made that fact known to their American counterparts, none dare address the US government directly. To some extent this is where Mr Rumsfeld ́s \"mad dog\" policy had some success in the beginning. However, Germany ́s foreign minister (and my last political boss) Joschka Fischer, saw off US pressure to commit German troops to Iraq by privately telling Rumsfeld that sanctions against Germany would result in his publishing these findings in the media and telling the world about it. It worked, and the Bush administration backed off. German guy 12/15/2004 5:36 pm EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks More recently we have been monitoring intensively the situation in Iran and American preparations for an assault on that nation ́s installations. Without betraying any aspect of Iran ́s readiness in this matter, I can only advise the Penatagon against any incursions in that sphere. The immediate consequences for Israel would be dramatic, to say the least, and the US navy would be seriously injured. However, as I said before, there is an obsession at play in the US administration by senior people who are not primarily concerned with America ́s best interests, but with certain corporate interests.

Indeed, we estimate that around 20 percent of the defence budget allocated for Iraq has mysteriously disappeared into this account. German guy 12/15/2004 6:00 pm EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks This was reported to me by a colleague: When the representatives of the BND presented to the American team its own view that Iraq did not possess WMD, the American side admitted that conventional intelligence had not produced any real evidence either. But, they said, we know it ́s there. We asked how they knew, but they did not provide us with a proper answer. However, we learned through intercepts that the Pentagon had employed \"psychics\" to visualise suspected Iraqi outposts. These lunatics then claimed to have seen huge stockpiles of lethal weaponry, including the whole palette of ABC weapons. On this basis, America invaded a country that did not threaten them. Now I hear that Mr Wolfowitz is talking to Jewish mystics to try to divine the right decison to make on Iran, this time through the arts of Kabbala. I know very little about this kind of religious practise but I do know that you should not allow such things to influence the foreign policy of the world ́s major nation. German guy 12/15/2004 6:13 pm EST Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks To answer a previous question: I didnÄt find the GLP forum, rather it found me. I spend all my free time doing researches for papers I am writing and (hopefully) a book. This is apart from my activities in private intelligence and communications monitoring. The internet is a good source of post-qualified information if you know where to look. It is not a primary source. In addition, I enjoy reading posts made in many so-called \"intelligence forums\" where people speculate about what may or may not happen.

This is it, folks Maybe you should ask the FBI (perhaps anonymously) whay they aren ́t investigating reports that Atlanta, Dallas and Houston are being singled out for the detonation of a nuclear device. I think you probably know the answer. In fact, we have no indication that the FBI has been informed at all and this pattern looks very similar to that seen prior to the events of 9-11.

I spend all my free time doing researches for papers I am writing and (hopefully) a book. This is apart from my activities in private intelligence and communications monitoring. The internet is a good source of post-qualified information if you know where to look. It is not a primary source. In addition, I enjoy reading posts made in many so-called \"intelligence forums\" where people speculate about what may or may not happen.

Inter-services: CIA, military, mercenary (ex-SAS: British logistics and ex-CIA Latin America operatives); Mossad aka \"al-Qaeda\" (Muslim Brotherhood backed by the City of London power brokers). How is it financed? Laundered money (Cayman Isles up until 1999), Afghan and SA drug money, funds diverted from the military budget. What is their purpose? To collapse the US economy, suspend normal government and militarise American society (conscription) - in place of destroying Frankfurt ́s finacial district which is home to the Central European Bank. What do they gain? In terms of politics, complete power and the sympathy of the world. It would then allow them to default on the national debt caused by huge budget deficits. At a personal level, the corporations of which key US admin would guarantee an income stream since many have already bailed out of US stocks. Who else gains? In the short term, the City of London financial super-class and Israel. Who loses? Almost everyone else. Please also note: We have reason to believe that many \"terrorist\" prisoners in US custody are being subjected to long periods of intense sensory deprivation and methods by which they acquire a new controlled personality.

I shall be back with more information and background this evening at around 23.00 hrs CET. Paul Wofowitz will authorise the detonation of a nuclear payload in the Houston area on December 27, 2004. The Hidden Hand network (Mossad/al-Qaeda/SAS) of which he is the nominal controller has verified in advance every aspect of operational integrity - a failsafe job with zero chance of discovery. Houston has been primed for months via deliberate mismanagement, incompetence, corruption and embezzlement at its FEMA-independent Emergency Center. The police and fire services have been deliberately and systematically sabotaged and thrown into administrative chaos so as to ensure maximum fatalities in the aftermath of the detonation. However, the existence of the center will provide the Bush administration with a \"we did everything we could\" excuse. We believe the Hidden Hand envisages the following scenario: 1. Detonation on Dec 27 (could be delayed, but all our intercepts point to this date) 2. The State Department blames \"al-Qaeda\", whose leaders are allegedly hiding in Iran 3. Iran (truthfully) denies giving refuge to said leaders 4. Bush issues Iran with a cowboy-style deadline for delivery of alleged leaders 5. Iran fails to comply because it cannot 6. UN convenes in emergency session - no agreement (Watch Ariel Sharon quietly flee to his private estate in Greece) 7. Other foreign intelligence agencies dispute the State Department version 8. Happily for Wolfowitz, Osama bin Laden releases a videotape claiming responsibility, warning America not to attack his \"brave warriors\" in Iran 9. American fighters launch a \"decapitation\" attack on the Iranian government and alleged \"al-Qaeda\" bases We know that the Wolfowitz network has concealed a remote-controlled nuclear payload in the Houston area. None of our intercepts give us exact coordinates. We have also heard the same code system used in regard to Atlanta and Dallas, although not with the same frequency. We believe that Mara Salvatruchas, the CIA-run Salvadora syndicate, is peripherally involved with the Wolfowitz network in protecting and running cover for a rogue ex-SAS British assassin who is perhaps the world ́s leading logistics and reconnaisance expert. Last known as either Frank Riley or Terence Lawley, we believe that he was responsible for the murder of nuclear physicist John Mullen on June 29. Mullen was approached by a Hidden Hand contact man posing as a CIA agent at the behest of Wolfowitz on February 12, 2003, and was asked to provide the \"CIA\" with an hypothetical schematic of a remote-controlled, trunk-sized nuclear device with a payload \"several times greater than ́Fat Man ́\" (in the interests of nationaly security).

Mullen was told that the hypothetical impact area would be \"a city the size of Houston\". Mullen complied with this request but grew suspicious toward the end of 2003 and abruptly ended his cooperation. At the beginning of June, Mr Mullen decided to contact the staff of former National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, with a view to discussing his CIA work with him. At the time Berger was too busy too see him immediately owing to his work as foreign policy adviser to John Kerry. We believe that this is what sealed the fate of Mr Mullen, as Sandy Berger does indeed have informal links to the Wolfowitz network and it is conceivable that Berger warned Hidden Hand. Incidentally, three weeks later Berger was charged by the FBI with the theft of critical documents from the National Archive relating to evidence that he had helped Wolfowitz facilitate the 9-11 attacks. Wolfowitz is also running a Mossad agent in the Houston area called Avner Meir, whose present status is unknown, but we believe he is currently holding a visitor ́s visa. His job is to facilitate the smuggling of Muslims (any Muslims will do) across the Mexican border and provide them with accomodation and distress funds under the asuspices of a fake charitable organisation. We suspect that Meir, also a master forger, will provide the unwitting Muslims with forged US passports and driving licences, plenty of Muslim literature, commendations and enough money to be \"seen and remembered\". This was the basis of my discussions with American diplomatic personnel in Frankfurt yesterday, both of whom have been locked in secret discussions with the German government over, among many other things, their application for political refugee status in the event of making this known to the media. The far side of the CIA and Mossad have been ordered to drop any plans they may have had for bombing the financial district of Frankfurt, including the European Central Bank. The Wolfowitz Network has decided that the Houston detonation must take priority over everything else. All of our intercepts, field information and disclosures from former (and not so former!) US diplomatic personnel, tell us that the American people are being set up for another, but even more devastating, 9-11 tragedy in which a tiny group of people will gain enormously at the expense of the rest of the world.

Please allow me to clarify something important. When the Bundesnachrichtendienst seeks to warn other nations about possible covert activity, it is standard procedure to transmit this information only to its opposite number. In the United States this is the CIA, which is then mandated to relay that intelligence to the government. The BND performed this function twice in 2001 prior to the 9-11 attacks, warning very explicitly with detailed information about exactly (and I mean \"exactly\") what the Wolfowitz network was doing. Twice, the BND was ignored. Although we are former BND operatives and analysts (plus my technical partner), who also work internationally in conjunction with \"The Library\", we would still be expected to follow standard procedure. However, we no longer trust the CIA establishment as an impartial mediator of critical information. Nor do we have much faith in the Bush executive, from within which the Wolfowitz network of the Hidden Hand was spawned. We therefore made an unprecedented decision to communicate these findings directly to the FBI. To date, we have seen no indication that any action has been taken, which is disheartening to say the least, if only because we may very well see history repeating itself. The sad truth is that almost every major state-based intelligence organisation is heavily compromised in the performance of its duties. As a Canadian operative (\"John Doe\") himself testified earlier in this discussion, even the BND is subject to arbitrary, politically inspired stand-down orders when it comes to breaking up Mossad subversion of sovereign nations. We know that American public service agencies (and to a lesser degree the British intelligence community) have been infiltrated top to bottom with Mossad and Hidden Hand assets and sympathisers, and that the American media deliberately fails to report this type of subversion. Why is that? We know that newspaper and media owners themselves are already wealthy and well-disposed toward the Hidden Hand. Well, you need to ask yourselves about the vast sums of cash siphoned off from defence procurement contracts in various budgets that are not properly audited by your Congress, such that said sums of money are given the designation \"slush and hush\" funds, managed by unaccountable financiers in the City of London.

Editors and journalists often enjoy a lifestyle far in excess of their normal salary - just for turning a blind eye. Please allow me to dispel a few myths. The internal and external communications of CIA stations and military installations in Germany are not only insecure, they are laughably easy to crack. I think many Americans go to see Hollywood films and come away with the impression that these people have all this whiz-bang technology and gadgets. So it would come as a shock to you to learn that many are still equipped with old Windows 95 machines :-). And they shouldn ́t be using Windows at all, even the latest rubbish. Up until recently, US military bases in Germany all used Compaq A900 printer/fax combos (yes, in the age of the internet!). These were all supplied by a bulk retailer in Germany. We rewired every Compaq A900 printer/fax before the bulk supplier shipped them. We knew that the machines were never swept for bugs, and even if they were they would never have registered any. For almost eight years nothing written on those machines escaped our attention! Here ́s the oldest info-leak in the book: wives and girlfriends. While agents and senior military personnel use encrypted communications (landlines and mobile/satellite), girlfriends and wives often use a standard E-plus, 02, D1 and D2 Telekom handy. (And don ́t forget: Mr Bush will not pay the expense of encrypting the mobile of a mistress/whore.) Now, in my time we were all forbidden from telling our wives or girlfriends about any aspect of our work. What we discovered over the years is that American personnel just cannot stop talking about how they are saving (or ruining) the world. Superheroes. Every detail. And how wives and girlfriends then tell their best friends about their charming \"secret agent\" American lovers! It ́s easy to set up a CIA agent with a new \"girlfriend\". They just can ́t say no, married or not, especially in cold cities such as Munich or Berlin during the winter months. Here ́s another myth: you cannot hack bluetooth from a distance of more than 40 metres. Not true. My technical partner Felix can crack it at over half a kilometre. Which is why he enjoys driving around so much in areas where we know British, American, Israeli or Russian ops are living or working.

Reality: It ́s child ́s play. Myth: only resourced intelligence agencies can run complex e-mail scaning bots and web bots with advanced pattern-recognition algorithms. Reality: The basic software technology is ubiquitous and deployment costs are minimal. The trick lies in the quality of human linguistic knowledge, so it ́s always a good idea to have an excellent university on hand with plenty of native language professors and students. The software is only as good as the human brains behind it. (No offence to people on this forum, but the quality of education in America does not look good for your future intelligence capabilities.) Israel develops good web bots (check the Mossad relationship to Google and you ́ll never use it again) but the best linguists are the French. After 9-11, both the French and German governments offered to help the CIA and FBI with their poor quality of foreign language skills and services. Once again, America turned down that offer. The British and Israelis are the world ́s best actors. MI6 gets a lot of young people who would otherwise make excellent stage or film actors. (I was stationed in England for a number of years, so I know from experience.) MI6 is first-class in establishing paper companies (fake fronts) ... But the BND excels at burning them to the ground :-) Politely, of course. It ́s now 01.10 CET and I ́m ready to sleep. I shall post again with some more information at around 22.00 hrs CET. I would now like to ask you to allow us to explain how we came to this point and why we are choosing, even at this late juncture, to make these things known in an unofficial venue. There is a certain mystique about intelligence work that does not really correlate to reality. The work we did, and which many of our friends and colleagues still do, is mostly every bit as mundane as the work civilians do in countless offices around the world. But there are moments and opportunities for great excitement and breakthroughs that you will remember with pride for the rest of your life, and because almost nobody in the real world will ever know about these historic moments it is very important to remind yourself that you do these things for your country, and that is sufficient reward in itself. We have all experienced what it is like to work for a company or an organisation that you feel has the best colleagues, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:germanguy.txt:15:4efb4c912b31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10469, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "germanguy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "germanguy", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "and opportunities for great excitement and breakthroughs that you will remember with pride for the rest of your life, and because almost nobody in the real world will ever know about these historic moments it is very important to remind yourself that you do these things for your country, and that is sufficient reward in itself. We have all experienced what it is like to work for a company or an organisation that you feel has the best colleagues, the most professional teamwork, real friendship that transcends all your other relationships; and you are honoured to find yourself working alongside some of the best talent and brains in the country. This is not just your family. It is your whole life. And, by the way, although we naturally compete and we are proud of \"getting one up\" on our richer and more powerful counterparts, when we are informed of the illness or death of an American, Russian, French, Canadian, Israeli or British operative we take it very personally. Although we often skirmish with one another for turf, contacts, information and channels - and sometimes it can get very tough (believe me) - we are still all brothers and sisters who face the same challenges and the same dangers, day after day. During our time at the BND we were all very proud to be working for a service that delivered more than it promised. As with every agency, we felt we could have done more with adequate funds and we thus worked long hours and employed more of our own ingenuity and personal resources in coming up with radical solutions to radical problems. It is therefore very upsetting when you see the fine results of your hard work wasted on politicians who are ultimately your bosses. You spend every minute of every day serving your country and working to make the world a better and safer place in which to live, and then you see your political masters working equally hard to betray all your efforts and suppress the truth, often allowing very wealthy and very powerful criminals to escape justice. Even if you are forced to the conclusion that they are not traitors to their country, they are certainly traitors to humanity. A good case in point, which I mentioned before, was the limited release to the American government of information that identified Paul Wolfowitz and his network, which we had been carefully monitoring for months, as key players in an attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon that we knew would take place sometime in September 2001. My technical assistant at the time even provided that exact same date based upon a pattern in his intercepts of the Hidden Hand associates who were in frequent communication with Wolfowitz (these included Richard Perle, Frank Riley, Richard Myers, John Poindexter, Bill Luti and Avner Meir, among many others too", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:germanguy.txt:16:0527c6847271", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10470, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "germanguy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "germanguy", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "we had been carefully monitoring for months, as key players in an attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon that we knew would take place sometime in September 2001.

We knew who had intimate knowledge of the 9-11 plan, mostly those at the top of the Wolfowitz pyramid, and we knew who had the general attitude of \"Tell me, but don ́t tell me\" lower down in the pyramid. When we went to our political masters in Berlin we laid it on the table and said, \"These are the facts. This is how it is.\" We did not expect an immediate reaction (other than disbelief) but we took it for granted that we would be authorised to alert the non-compromised sections of the CIA and FBI who we hoped would be in a position to close the Wolfowitz operation down before people were killed. To cut a long story very short, there was a process of political haggling and nervous hysterics as to what we should or should not tell the American government and security services, and to make matters worse we were forbidden to communicate directly with agents we trusted and knew were not part of the Hidden Hand and the Wolfowitz network. Even though I am not a Social Democrat, I have a lot of respect for Shroeder and I do believe he and Fischer wrestled with this more than the others, who are basically cowards, afraid of offending the Israel lobby and powerful corporate interests. But slowly we watched the truth hacked down to manageable and politically \"safe\" proportions and then communicated to the wrong people - the people who should have been the last to know. When that information was transmitted to the Bush administration it had been shorn of all the names and details that belonged in the original case file. Even then, it was ignored: twice. I am not among those who believe that the Israelis have as much influence and power in Germany as they do over the corresponding political process in America, but I am sure that there are forces behind our government that are illuminated solely by the six-pointed star and do everything in their power to make sure that no intelligence \"made in Germany\" impacts their long-term plans.

No one was more devastated by the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon than my colleagues at the BND. Everything they had predicted transpired exactly as they thought it would. Please try to imagine that feeling as you watch those towers tumble and you see the men responsible for those horrific crimes winking mischieviously into a television camera, blaming a (CIA) contract man sitting in a dirt hole in Afghanistan. The only consolation for us was that the French too had some information that tallied with ours, and Chirac (privately) informed his deputies that he was not going to allow the Americans to hoodwink his executive; and as I have said before, there is not a single senior government figure in the world today who does not know the truth about the Wolfowitz plan and the 9-11 attacks (largely thanks to the \"out-of-office\" work of BND colleagues who refused to let the truth be buried). It is likely now that more operatives and former operatives from other intelligence agencies, with the help of our colleagues at \"The Library\", will step forward into the public limelight with more information and so pressure their political masters, such as Tony Blair, to admit the truth about 9-11 and then resign or go to prison. Sadly, the deception continues and we are about to enter a whole new lethal game, a place where the human race has never been before. Just as it was in August 2001, we are now seeing a similar pattern of events taking place. Incidentally, not only in the intercepts we have been making for quite some time and the information we are gaining in field opertions, but also in the behaviour of the financial markets and the rhetoric put out by the Bush administration and juniors within the ranks of the Wolfowitz network. Of course, we have made this information available to select officials in authority, but once again inactivity and fear of the Metsada and the Wolfowitz network has paralysed any rational thinking in the United States. How is it that a superpower such as America has allowed itself to be controlled by such a small group of extremely selfish and evil men?

It is now 23.08 CET and I still have a number of things I would like to impart to you this evening, but I must first wait for my technical partner Felix because I would like to discuss with him some legal details. Incidentally, by way of introduction, my partner Felix is chief coordinator in our group for all intercepts. Not only is he fluent in Japanese and Chinese, his English is much natural than mine. In fact, it was his idea to come here and he wrote the opening message in this discussion and edited another message too. This evening he has been to the Weihnachtsmarkt and has probably been drinking some Glühwein, which if you have ever been here you will know that you must stay away from it (especially in the cold). Unfortunately he has just become a father of a baby girl, which means to me that he will spend less time in his van driving around our cities bluejacking various embassies, consulates and \"safe addresses\". :-( I have just taken the chance to skim through some of the comments here, and thus it is plain to me that our old friends are up to their usual tricks, even in internet forums. Their numbers are few, but they make a lot of noise when they feel threatened. I am also aware that many of you have set before me a huge palette of bewildering questions that I simply cannot hope to answer to your satisfaction in the time we have allowed ourselves. I therefore ask you to forgive me and please do not think that I am not being polite. I know that one of the most frequent questions has been about ID verification. Well, strange as it may seem, even former operatives don ́t go around with big neon letters glued to their foreheads flashing from B to N to D or even impart as much personal detail as I have to you this evening.

I use four different operating systems to access the internet: a hacker-friendly Microschrott Betriebssystem (yes, I live dangerously sometimes) with a US browser, FreeBSD, Knoppix (a German distro) and SuSe Linux (another German product). The moderator also has permission to confirm the Germanness of my machine. That probably won ́t be enough to satisfy our above-mentioned friends, but what can I do? Besides, I am not here to build long-term relationships and father any children you may wish to have with me. This was a very unusual decision on our part, but it seems we live in very unusual times. Back to business. We have to decide tomorrow whether we need to release this to other groups on the internet (in French, Japanese, Italian and Spanisch) and we do so with our eyes on the clock. So time is pressing on. I hope my colleague arrives shortly before I publish another message. If not, I shall do so over the weekend. It is now 00.18 CET and time for me to brew some Lavazza. If I would be allowed to spend some time with members of your Congress, I would perhaps be inclined to ask those not compromised by the Wolfowitz network and the Israeli government a number of very important questions: Why has the FBI failed to investigate the role played by Mr Wolfowitz in illegally helping Kamran Akhtar (a.k.a. Kamran Shaikh) with cover and technical support immediately after the CIA-backed Mara Salvatruchas had brought him safely across the Mexican border and shortly before the arrest of Akhtar by Charlotte City police on July 20? Why did Mr Wolfowitz ask Avner Meir to provide Kamran Akhtar with video equipment and explicit instructions to film public buildings and vital civilian infrastructure in Houston, Atlanta and Dallas? Why did Mr Wolfowitz order the assassination of an undercover CIA operative, Kamel Derwish, who had worked so faithfully for him by recruiting and importing Mossad-trained al-Qaeda agents under the codename \"Operation Haeremai\"? Was it because Kamel Derwish was under investigation by dedicated FBI agents and thus exposed Wolfowitz to charges of treason and material conspiracy in planning acts of terrorism against the American people?

Why did Mr Wolfowitz pressure John Ashcroft to order an FBI closure of the investigation of the murder of nuclear physicist John Mullen, who, as we already know, had been briefed by a network contact man to provide an hypothetical schematic of a remote-controlled nuclear device to be detonated in an \"hypothetical\" city \"the size of Houston\"? It is 02.30 hrs CET. Goodnight. My apologies for posting to you much later than anticipated. We have had a very busy schedule over the last twelve hours, negotiating with a possible spokesman to present our findings on ZDF, which is Germany ́s second largest television public service channel. Naturally, we cannot ourselves make a public appearance, for that is the name of the game when you commit your life to serving to protect democracy from criminal elements, no matter how powerful and wealthy those criminals may be. I also hear that my old boss at the BND is not very happy, as he has been bombarded by questions from the outside; and junior staff at the Außenministerium (German Foreign Ministry) are running around in a panic. The truth hurts sometimes. But what can I do about it? I shall only post sporadically this evening and tomorrow evening because Felix is working on the Japanese media at the moment and I need him to check my Ps and Qs, as the British say. Although I have already posted some of the most important questions to be investigated by your FBI and Congress - and this should be done immediately so that the Wolfowitz network is apprehended before December 27 - there are still a number of less urgent but equally important questions and matters that deserve our attention, such as the relationship between Mr Cheney and his Energy Commission and the Nuclear Weapons Council.

It is 21.22 CET. I shall post again shortly. Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ... This is it, folks It is, of course, supremely inadvisable to hold fast to political allegiances when you work in the field of national security. My friend and technical assistant Felix is a Social Democrat and therefore looks favourably upon Mr Schroeder. For my part, I ́m what you Americans would call a Libertarian. My friend Mr Möllemann, who was expected to assume leadership of the Free Democrats, held to a number of ideals that were essentially Libertarian; and he had also started to speak out against Israel and, privately, against the way in which Mossad actively bribes, bullies and blackmails German politicians and government ministers to favour the agenda of select corporations. Two weeks later he died in a \"tragic accident\". (Everyone working for the BND knows the full facts about the Mossad Sayim who tampered with his parachute, but for some very strange reason these details remain away from the public domain in a little brown file labelled \"Case Closed\".) Because I was assigned the desk of Political Analyst (after many years as a field operative), I had the great fortune of meeting with Mr Möllemann on a number of occasions. He knew about what is happening in Germany and he vowed to put an end to it. He knew how the Hidden Hand had successfully destroyed Britain and America ́s industrial heartlands and he was not going to allow them to hollow-out the German economy and German society in the same way. He knew that the best guarantor of a world free from the threat of war and endless violence was absolute honesty on the part of politicians, and he was within weeks of telling the world the truth about America ́s 9-11 and the Wolfowitz Network. He knew too much. \"Wer gegen Jachowa ist, muß sterben.\" As I imparted to you yesterday, there is nothing more awful than knowing in advance the identity of men who are about to commit a crime against humanity, yet being told to keep quiet for fear of upsetting the perpetrators.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:germanguy.txt:22:749c5731fe73", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10476, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "germanguy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "germanguy", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "and endless violence was absolute honesty on the part of politicians, and he was within weeks of telling the world the truth about America ́s 9-11 and the Wolfowitz Network.

America ́s Deputy Defence Secretary directly authorised the killing of thousands of Americans on 9-11, and yet today I watched him on a newsfeed congratulating American soldiers for risking their lives in the fight against \"terrorists\". You can call me an old-fashioned guy, but somehow that doesn ́t seem right to me. My greatest fear for Germany, and Europe as a whole, is that one day we will end up with a media every bit as controlled as America ́s. Now I would be the last to claim that we have a free and open press in Germany. I know how the system works. I know about a great many crimes, financial and sexual, that have been committed by ministers in German governments over the last thirty years. I know more than Mr Möllemann ever knew, and I know just how many of those stories were killed before they ever reached the ears of a journalist or, if they did, how those journalists were \"persuaded\" to \"think about their longterm careers\" and be \"sensible\". That said, Germans would never tolerate being lied to in the way that Americans are deceived every day they draw breath. Many years ago I did a sabbatical in the United States to train with CIA operatives. Later, because the Justice Department insisted, we did an equal amount of training with the FBI. I was astonished at the openness and good-humoured honesty of my American colleagues and I was somewhat taken aback by America ́s vast landscape of protected rights and constitutional freedoms. But even then I was cognisant of the hypnotising effects on ordinary Americans wrought by the Hidden Hand through its Israel-controlled media. Unknown to the FBI and CIA, I was also briefed by my handlers to investigate Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger, who we already knew to be a Mossad asset. In fact, the BND managed to acquire a copy of all 2,000 pages of Mr Weinberger ́s \"missing document\" long before Congress demanded an investigation, later known as the Iran-Contra hearings. Our BND contact in Tel Aviv confirmed that, from 1985, Weinberger met regularly with Mossad Director Nahum Admoni at the Sheraton Moriah in Room 33 for receipt of secret payments for \"services to the motherland, Israel\". During his tenure in the Reagan administration, Mr Weinberger quietly deposited over 3 million US dollars in two separate bank accounts in Switzerland: the United Bank", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:germanguy.txt:23:d1b2bdf7cc64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10477, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "germanguy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "germanguy", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "of Mr Weinberger ́s \"missing document\" long before Congress demanded an investigation, later known as the Iran-Contra hearings. Our BND contact in Tel Aviv confirmed that, from 1985, Weinberger met regularly with Mossad Director Nahum Admoni at the Sheraton Moriah in Room 33 for receipt of secret payments for \"services to the motherland, Israel\". During his tenure in the Reagan administration, Mr Weinberger quietly deposited over 3 million US dollars in two separate bank accounts in Switzerland: the United Bank of Switzerland and the Intermaritime Bank of Geneva, which was managed by a Mossad agent called Bruce Rappaport. Mr Rappaport played an important role in helping both Admoni and the British MI6 finance a number of projects spawned by the British-created Muslim Brotherhood. One of those projects had been ongoing for quite some time: al-Qaeda, headed by US-trained CIA pointman Tim Osman, otherwise known as Osama bin Laden. Mr Rappaport arranged for the vast transfer of already laundered cash (BND figures: 2.5 billion dollars) from the London division of the Bank for Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) to its Swiss managing bank, the Banque de Commerce et Placements in Geneva. These funds were administered by Mossad devotee Alfred Hartmann on behalf of the new \"al-Qaeda\" entity. In addition, the Israeli government was directing millions of dollars of American taxpayers ́ money into this same account. So while US Defence Secretary Mr Weinberger was taking blood money from Admoni and selling arms to Iran, Admoni ́s business partners were not only managing Mr Weinbergers bribes, they were reinvesting them in building up al-Qaeda and a CIA-backed terrorist network that would play the perfect foil for Mr Wolfowitz seventeen years later. Did Mr Wolfowitz inherit any of this money? Let me reply in the affirmative. We have evidence that not only Mr Wolfowitz, but other leading Hidden Hand members of the American and Israeli establishment are already drawing upon funds estimated at over 10 billion US dollars in various Swiss bank accounts that are primarily designed to offset the personal costs involved in relocating homes, businesses, wealth and security operations to Patagonia. Why Patagonia? Please allow me to make one thing very clear. None of these gentlemen will shed a single tear when ordinary Israeli citizens are destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Their concern for them is only marginally more so than it is for the American people. . It is 23.58 CET. Re: December 27 ... Expect \"something big\" ...

If one thing is guaranteed to strike fear in the hearts of those who belong to the Hidden Hand and the Wolfowitz Network, whose globalist nightmare they wish to impose on all of us, it is the mention of \"The Library\". It may come as a huge surprise to many ordinary citizens to learn that intelligence services the world over unknowingly and unwittingly employ men and women of good character who care about the truth and who envisage a world free of the Hidden Hand that cares only for its own material wealth, power, pleasures and survival. \"The Library\" is both an informal, non-hierarchical fraternity of currently employed, retired, disillusioned and \"officially deceased\" operatives, analysts and technicians and a very real, hidden and secured repository of classified and \"destroyed\" inside information that tells the true history of the last 100 years. The eldest member of \"The Library\" is 85 years old; the youngest is 24. Many who are retired from active service, such as myself in Germany, continue to work the intelligence world in a strictly unpaid, anonymous and private fashion. Others, such as my younger friend and technical partner \"Felix\", who is still a quasi-employee of the BND, work both sides of the fence, seeing through the good work of recording every misdeed, every suppression of the truth, every lie, every deceit, every detail that is deserving of a place in \"The Library\". Felix is joined in numbers by his counterparts in the CIA, FBI, MI6, Mossad, Shin Bet, NSA, US Naval Intelligence, DGSE, FSB, DIA, ASIS, CNI, DST, ADIV, CSIS, CESID, PSIA, DISI and many more.

Instead, we practise diligence, patience and careful strategic thinking. We all have children or grandchildren, or wish to live long enough to bring them into a world of free and independent nation states, each sovereign and inviolable in its own right. The information I have provided you in the course of my communications is but nothing in comparison with what \"The Library\" holds; and I hope we live long enough to open the door and let the reader hold an open book on the truth he has been denied. Yet the clock is ticking and time is no longer on our side. They are devising new ways to track us and stamp us with their identifying tags, so that none may live in this world free from their constant gaze. There will be no place to hide from their evil eye. The next seven days potentially represent the most dangerous since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. We have followed the progress made by Mr Wolfowitz and his ilk in their long march through the institutions. We observed how he planned and authorised the 9-11 attacks on the American people and the world, and we warned but were thwarted in all our attempts to stop this horrific crime. Now he has set his sights on destroying another American city, this time with nuclear weaponry, to purchase with the blood of innocent Americans yet another fake war waged in the name of corporate global control and at the dictates of the nefarious Hidden Hand. In the days that we have left to us, we shall continue to scrutinise every intercept and question all-comers, whether diplomatic and intelligence staff here in Germany or others sympathetic to \"The Library\" elsewhere.

Things are happening, and they are happening very quickly. Many of you wouldn ́t know it by reading your newspapers and watching the television news, but the world came closer to nuclear destruction this year than at any time since 1962, and the level of danger remains so high that a single ill-advised word is all that it would take to bring everything we know and love to a sudden end. This is not a message anyone wants to hear, particularly at this time of year, but I am not here to play party games and send out fancy little presents that look good and taste delicious. You are perhaps of no mind to hear the \"fear-mongers\" or the \"prophets of doom\" because, after all, you have a choice and it ́s easier to pick up the only remote-control with which they trust you and switch over to a different version of reality that has all the assurances of a superficial soap opera with a predictably cosy storyline. I have also had a chance to review some of the messages submitted by certain others in this forum, and my wife has examined some of the fallout elsewhere on the internet, most of which is positive and having a dramatic effect in places where tough decisions will have to be made by those who respect and enforce just and equitable law. There are many who still just don ́t \"get it\" because the facts I have presented do not sing the same song as their own deeply ingrained belief systems.

As I have stated before, there are at the moment only a few significant power centres that are worthy of your urgent attention: the Wolfowitz Network, the Hidden Hand, the City of London and a powerful elite of anti-Jewish fanatics who only pretend to be Jews and are protected twenty-four hours around the clock by an elite within Mossad and a vast army of other \"Israeli\" front groups. Sometimes they do indeed compete within and among themselves for the highest rewards and honours, and such internal competition can also take on a ruthless and non-fraternal face. However, they are generally united in terms of the world they envisage for you and me - and believe me when I tell you that you do not want to go there. You are not powerless. You can bring their games to an end overnight without one shot being fired. How do I know this? After many long years of service for the Bundesnachrichtendienst - a record of employment that took me around the world and placed me on several occasions deep within the belly of the beast - I can honestly tell you that these people are yet still vulnerable and are prone to costly, self-damaging mistakes. In the questions to the FBI below (and further text with English spelling corrections), which I urgently re-post in the hope that Wolfowitz is publicly forced to answer every single charge before it is too late, I have outlined just a few examples of the way in which these people expose themselves to investigation and prosecution.

Paul Wolfowitz will authorise the detonation of a nuclear payload in the Houston area on December 27, 2004. The Hidden Hand network (Mossad/al-Qaeda/SAS) of which he is the nominal controller has verified in advance every aspect of operational integrity - a failsafe job with zero chance of discovery. Houston has been primed for months via deliberate mismanagement, incompetence, corruption and embezzlement at its FEMA-independent Emergency Center. The police and fire services have been deliberately and systematically sabotaged and thrown into administrative chaos so as to ensure maximum fatalities in the aftermath of the detonation. However, the existence of the center will provide the Bush administration with a \"we did everything we could\" excuse. We believe the Hidden Hand envisages the following scenario: 1. Detonation on Dec 27 (could be delayed, but all our intercepts point to this date) 2. The State Department blames \"al-Qaeda\", whose leaders are allegedly hiding in Iran 3. Iran (truthfully) denies giving refuge to said leaders 4. Bush issues Iran with a cowboy-style deadline for delivery of alleged leaders 5. Iran fails to comply because it cannot 6. UN convenes in emergency session - no agreement (Watch Ariel Sharon quietly flee to his private estate in Greece) 7. Other foreign intelligence agencies dispute the State Department version 8. Right on cue, Osama bin Laden releases a videotape claiming responsibility, warning America not to attack his \"brave warriors\" in Iran 9. American fighters launch a \"decapitation\" attack on the Iranian government and alleged \"al-Qaeda\" bases We know that the Wolfowitz network has concealed a remote-controlled nuclear payload in the Houston area. None of our intercepts give us exact coordinates. We have also heard the same code system used in regard to Atlanta and Dallas, although not with the same frequency.

Last known as either Frank Riley or Terence Lawley, we believe that he was responsible for the murder of nuclear physicist John Mullen on June 29. Mullen was approached by a Hidden Hand contact man posing as a CIA agent at the behest of Wolfowitz on February 12, 2003, and was asked to provide the \"CIA\" with an hypothetical schematic of a remote-controlled, trunk-sized nuclear device with a payload \"several times greater than ́Fat Man ́\" (in the interests of national security). Mullen was told that the hypothetical impact area would be \"a city the size of Houston\". Mullen complied with this request but grew suspicious toward the end of 2003 and abruptly ended his cooperation. At the beginning of June, Mr Mullen decided to contact the staff of former National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, with a view to discussing his CIA work with him. At the time Berger was too busy too see him immediately owing to his work as foreign policy adviser to John Kerry. We believe that this is what sealed the fate of Mr Mullen, as Sandy Berger does indeed have informal links to the Wolfowitz network and it is conceivable that Berger warned Hidden Hand. Incidentally, three weeks later Berger was charged by the FBI with the theft of critical documents from the National Archive relating to evidence that he had helped Wolfowitz facilitate the 9-11 attacks. Wolfowitz is also running a Mossad agent in the Houston area called Avner Meir, whose present status is unknown, but we believe he is currently holding a visitor ́s visa. His job is to facilitate the smuggling of Muslims (any Muslims will do) across the Mexican border and provide them with accommodation and distress funds under the auspices of a fake charitable organisation. We suspect that Meir, also a master forger, will provide the unwitting Muslims with forged US passports and driving licences, plenty of Muslim literature, commendations and enough money to be \"seen and remembered\".

Smith In a study in the early 1990's rats were fed genetically modified (GM) tomatoes. Well actually, the rats refused to eat them. They were force-fed. Several of the rats developed stomach lesions and seven out of forty died within two weeks. [[1]](#_edn1) Scientists at the FDA who reviewed the study agreed that it did not provide a \"demonstration of reasonable certainty of no harm.\" In fact, **agency scientists warned that GM foods in general might create unpredicted allergies, toxins, antibiotic resistant diseases, and nutritional problems. ** Internal FDA memos made public from a lawsuit reveal that the scientists urged their superiors to require long-term safety testing to catch these hard-to-detect side effects. [[2]](#_edn2) But FDA political appointees, including a former attorney for Monsanto in charge of policy, ignored the scientists' warnings. The FDA does not require safety studies. Instead, if the makers of the GM foods claim that they are safe, the agency has no further questions. The GM tomato was approved in 1994. According to a July 27, 2004 report from the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS), [[3]](#_edn3) the current system of blanket approval of GM foods by the FDA might not detect \"unintended changes in the composition of the food.\" The process of gene insertion, according to the NAS, could damage the host's DNA with unpredicted consequences. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which released its findings a few days earlier, identified a long list of potentially dangerous side effects from GM foods that are not being evaluated. The ICMR called for a complete overhaul of existing regulations. [[4]](#_edn4) The safety studies conducted by the biotech industry are often dismissed by critics as superficial and designed to avoid finding problems. **Tragically, scientists who voice their criticism, as well as those who have discovered incriminating evidence, have been threatened, stripped of responsibilities, denied funding or tenure, or fired.** [[5]](#_edn5) For example, a UK government-funded study demonstrated that rats fed a GM potato developed potentially pre-cancerous", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:gmoinyourfood.txt:0:4a3417569adc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10487, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "gmoinyourfood.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "gmoinyourfood", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "are not being evaluated.

[[7]](#_edn7) When the lead scientist went public with his concerns, he was promptly fired from his job after 35 years and silenced with threats of a lawsuit. **Americans eat genetically modified foods everyday.** Although the GM tomato has been taken off the market, millions of acres of soy, corn, canola, and cotton have had foreign genes inserted into their DNA. The new genes allow the crops to survive applications of herbicide, create their own pesticide, or both. While there are only a handful of published animal safety studies, mounting evidence, which needs to be followed up, suggests that these foods are not safe. Rats fed GM corn had problems with blood cell, kidney and liver formation. [[8]](#_edn8) Mice fed GM soy had problems with liver cell formation [[9]](#_edn9) and pancreatic function [[10]](#_edn10), and the livers of rats fed GM canola were heavier. [[11]](#_edn11) Pigs fed GM corn on several Midwest farms developed false pregnancies or sterility. [[12]](#_edn12) **Cows fed GM corn in Germany died mysteriously.** And twice the number of chickens died when fed GM corn compared to those fed natural corn. [[13]](#_edn13) **Soon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, soy allergies skyrocketed by 50 percent.** [[14]](#_edn14) Without follow-up tests, we can't be sure if genetic engineering was the cause, but there are plenty of ways in which genetic manipulation can boost allergies. A gene from a Brazil nut inserted into soybeans made the soy allergenic to those who normally react to Brazil nuts. [[15]](#_edn15) GM soy currently consumed in the US contains a gene from bacteria. The inserted gene creates a protein that was never before part of the human food supply, and might be allergenic. Sections of that protein are identical to those found in shrimp and dust mite allergens. [[16]](#_edn16) According to criteria recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), this fact should have disqualified GM soy from approval. The sequence of the gene that was inserted into soy has inexplicably rearranged over time. [[17]](#_edn17) The protein it creates is likely to be different than the one intended, and was never subject to any safety studies. It may be allergenic or toxic. The process of inserting the foreign gene damaged a section of the soy's own DNA, scrambling its genetic code. [[18]](#_edn18) This mutation might", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:gmoinyourfood.txt:1:238f47b819db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10488, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "gmoinyourfood.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "gmoinyourfood", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the World Health Organization (WHO), this fact should have disqualified GM soy from approval.

The process of inserting the foreign gene damaged a section of the soy's own DNA, scrambling its genetic code. [[18]](#_edn18) This mutation might interfere with DNA expression or create a new, potentially dangerous protein. The most common allergen in soy is called trypsin inhibitor. GM soy contains significantly more of this compared with natural soy. [[19]](#_edn19) **The only human feeding study ever conducted showed that the gene inserted into soybeans spontaneously transferred out of food and into the DNA of gut bacteria.** [[20]](#_edn20) This has several serious implications. First, it means that the bacteria inside our intestines, newly equipped with this foreign gene, may create the novel protein inside of us. If it is allergenic or toxic, it may affect us for the long term, even if we give up eating GM soy. The same study verified that the promoter, which scientists attach to the inserted gene to permanently switch it on, also transferred to gut bacteria. Research on this promoter suggests that it might unintentionally switch on other genes in the DNA - permanently. [[21]](#_edn21) This could create an overproduction of allergens, toxins, carcinogens, or antinutrients. Scientists also theorize that the promoter might switch on dormant viruses embedded in the DNA or generate mutations. [[22]](#_edn22) Unfortunately, gene transfer from GM food might not be limited to our gut bacteria. Preliminary results show that the promoter also transferred into rat organs, after they were fed only a single GM meal. [[23]](#_edn23) This is only a partial list of what may go wrong with a single GM food crop. The list for others may be longer. Take for example, the corn inserted with a gene that creates its own pesticide. We eat that pesticide, and plenty of evidence suggests that it is not as benign as the biotech proponents would have us believe. Preliminary evidence, for example, shows that thirty-nine Philippinos living next to a pesticide-producing cornfield developed skin, intestinal, and respiratory reactions while the corn was pollinating. Tests of their blood also showed an immune response to the pesticide. [[24]](#_edn24) Consider what might happen if the gene that produces the pesticide were to transfer from the corn we eat into our gut bacteria. It could theoretically transform our intestinal flora into living pesticide factories. GM corn and most GM crops are also inserted with antibiotic resistant genes. The ICMR, along with the American Medical Association, the WHO, and organizations worldwide, have expressed concern about the possibility that these might transfer to pathogenic bacteria inside our gut. They are afraid that it might create", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:gmoinyourfood.txt:2:230f3879528a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10489, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "gmoinyourfood.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "gmoinyourfood", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "happen if the gene that produces the pesticide were to transfer from the corn we eat into our gut bacteria.

The ICMR, along with the American Medical Association, the WHO, and organizations worldwide, have expressed concern about the possibility that these might transfer to pathogenic bacteria inside our gut. They are afraid that it might create new, antibiotic resistant super-diseases. The defense that the biotech industry used to counter these fears was that the DNA was fully destroyed during digestion and therefore no such transfer of genes was possible. The human feeding study described above, published in February 2004, overturned this baseless assumption. **No one monitors human health impacts of GM foods.** If the foods were creating health problems in the US population, it might take years or decades before we identified the cause. One epidemic in the 1980's provides a chilling example. A new disease was caused by a brand of the food supplement L-tryptophan, which had been created through genetic modification and contained tiny traces of contaminants. The disease killed about 100 Americans and caused sickness or disability in about 5-10,000 others. [[25]](#_edn25) The only reason that doctors were able to identify that an epidemic was occurring, was because the disease had three simultaneous characteristics: it was rare, acute, and fast acting. Even then it was nearly missed entirely. Studies show that the more people learn about GM foods, the less they trust them. [[26]](#_edn26) In Europe, Japan, and other regions, the press has been far more open about the potential dangers of genetic manipulation. Consequently, consumers there demand that their food supply be GM-free and manufacturers comply. But** in the US, most people believe they have never eaten a GM food in their lives [[27]](#_edn27) (even though they consume them daily). ** Lacking awareness, complacent consumers have been the key asset for the biotech industry in the US. As a result, millions of Americans are exposed to the potential dangers, and children are most at risk. Perhaps the revelations in the reports released on opposite sides of the planet will awaken consumers as well as regulators, and GM foods on the market will be withdrawn. © Copyright 2004 by Jeffrey M.

This particular year a few days before Christmas, he punished his little five-year-old daughter after learning that she had used up the family's only roll of expensive gold wrapping paper. As money was tight, he became even more upset when on Christmas Eve he saw that the child had used all of the expensive gold paper to decorate one shoebox she had put under the Christmas tree. He also was concerned about where she had gotten money to buy what was in the shoebox. Nevertheless, the next morning the little girl, filled with excitement, brought the gift box to her father and said, \"This is for you, Daddy!\" As he opened the box, the father was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, now regretting how he had punished her. But when he opened the shoebox, he found it was empty and again his anger flared. \"Don't you know, young lady,\" he said harshly, \"when you give someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside the package!\" The little girl looked up at him with sad tears rolling from her eyes and whispered: \"Daddy, it's not empty. I blew kisses into it until it was all full.\" The father was crushed. He fell on his knees and put his arms around his precious little girl. He begged her to forgive him for his unnecessary anger. An accident took the life of the child only a short time later. It is told that the father kept this little gold box by his bed for all the years of his life. Whenever he was discouraged or faced difficult problems, he would open the box, take out an imaginary kiss, and remember the love of this beautiful child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of us has been given an invisible golden box filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children, family, friends and God. There is no more precious possession anyone could hold. **Note:** For several other wonderfully inspirational short Christmas stories, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/christmas_stories).

He was 77. Cooper died at his home in Ventura, California. \"As one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Gordon Cooper was one of the faces of America's fledgling space program.

He truly portrayed the right stuff, and he helped gain the backing and enthusiasm of the American public, so critical for the spirit of exploration,\" NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said on the space agency's Web site. Cooper, an Oklahoma native who entered the Marine Corps after graduating from high school in 1945, later became an elite Air Force test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, where he became fascinated with the space program. By April 1959, Cooper was named as one of the Project Mercury astronauts, following grueling physical and mental tests each candidate had to endure. At the news conference naming the future of America's space program, Cooper was joined by Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Glenn, M. Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra Jr. and Deke Slayton. On May 15 and 16, 1963, Cooper piloted the Faith 7 spacecraft on a 22-orbit mission that concluded the operational phase of Project Mercury. A little more than two years later, he would set a new space endurance record, serving as command pilot of the eight-day, 120-revolution Gemini 5 mission, which began August 21, 1965. It was on this flight that he and Charles Conrad traveled a distance of 3,312,993 miles in 190 hours and 56 minutes. Cooper also became the first man to make a second orbital flight. During his two space flights, Cooper logged 225 hours, 15 minutes and 3 seconds. He served as backup command pilot for Gemini 12 and as backup commander for Apollo X. In an interview with CNN in 2000, Cooper said in-house politics kept him off the moon flights. \"I would have liked to have gone to the moon. I would have liked to have been one of the crew that landed on the moon but it just didn't work out that way. And I don't, I certainly don't harbor any bitterness or anger.\" In addition to his space flights, Cooper logged more than 7,000 hours flying time in jets and commercial aircraft. He retired from the Air Force and NASA in 1970 with the rank of colonel. After leaving NASA, Cooper served on the boards of directors as a technical consultant to a number of companies in the aerospace, electronics and energy fields. He also was the vice president for research and development for Walter E. Disney Enterprises Inc., from 1974-1980. **In his post-NASA career, Cooper became known as an outspoken believer in UFOs and charged that the government was covering up its knowledge of extraterrestrial activity.** **\"I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:gordoncooper.txt:1:b7941f97620e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10497, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "gordoncooper.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "gordoncooper", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "colonel.

Some 31 others were charged with her. The judge, Chief Judge Hamilton of DC federal district court, was silent after Doris made her statement.

Instead, he sentenced everyone to time already served, plus $10 (that was a reduced administration fee, not actually a fine. The usual fee is $50). He met with Doris in his chambers after the session and told her to \"take care, because it is people like you who will help us reach our destiny.\" Some of his clerks were in tears at the meeting.

I risk my good name - for I do indeed care what my neighbors think about me. But, Your Honor, some of us do not have much power, except to put our bodies in the way of an injustice--to picket, to walk, or to just stand in the way. It will not change the world overnight, but it is all we can do. So I am here today while others block the halls with their corruption. Twenty-five million dollars are changing hands this very evening at a fund raiser down the street. It is the corrupt sale of public policy, and everyone knows it. I would refer those officials and those lobbyists, Your Honor, to Mr. Bob Dylan's advice when he wrote: \"Come senators, congressmen, Please heed the call. Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.\" Your Honor, the song was a few years early, but the time has now come for change. The times are changing because they must. And they will sweep away the old politician --the self-serving, the self-absorbed, the corrupt. The time of that leader is rapidly fading. We have come through a brief time when we have allowed ourselves to be entertained by corrupt and hapless leaders because they offer so little else, and because, as citizens, we have been priced out of participation and can only try to get some enjoyment out of their follies. But the earth itself can no longer afford them. We owe this change to our children and our grandchildren and our great grandchildren. We need have no fear that a self-governing people can creatively and effectively address their needs as a nation and a world if the corrupt and greedy are out of their way, and ethical leadership is given the helm. Your Honor, to the business at hand: the old woman who stands before you was arrested for reading the Declaration of Independence in America's Capitol Building. I did not raise my voice to do so and I blocked no hall.

Start by sitting quietly with yourself. Take a few slow, deep breaths while inviting your mind to settle down. Just notice and feel your breath for a minute or so. Feel your heart beating. Notice what you are feeling. Find and open to the place in your heart which only wants to love and be loved. Allow this energy to flow through your body. Connect with the hearts of others. As you go through the day, look for the heart in each person you meet. Imagine and connect with the place in them that wants only to love and be loved. When you wake up in the morning and just before going to bed at night, open to doing this and to feeling your own heart and the place within that just wants to love and be loved. Think of a few people that you believe are beyond help like T.J. Ware in the story.

The case in question was filed by former Telecom Italia worker Roberto Romeo, 59, against Italy's National Institute for Insurance Against Workplace Accidents (INAIL), a national insurance provider. Romeo testified that he used cell phones for four to five hours daily during the average work week. He was employed by Telecom Italia for 15 years before he was diagnosed with a benign tumor, neurinoma of the acoustic nerve. He contracted meningitis after the removal of the nerve, as well as suffering damage to 23 percent of his other bodily functions. In the initial ruling, INAIL was ordered to compensate Romeo €500 ($557.42 in U.S. dollars) monthly for the rest of his life. INAIL appealed the decision. **The court did not allow lawyers for INAIL to submit studies to the court which were financially supported by telecom companies**. Two court-appointed doctors subsequently provided testimony for Romeo's case during the appeals process, producing studies which declared that individuals who spoke on their phones for an average of 30 minutes a day ... increased their risk of developing head tumors.

The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently announced ... that the commission will soon reaffirm the radio frequency radiation (RFR) exposure limits that the FCC adopted in the late 1990s. These limits are based upon a [behavioral change in rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21999884) exposed to microwave radiation and were designed to protect us from [short-term heating risks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZcI0mHUoPlu3tBsWufCg28lXd7V2prKY/view) due to RFR exposure.

The lobbying efforts have alarmed local officials across the country. They say they need to ensure that their communities do not end up with unsightly poles cluttering sidewalks, roadsides and the edges of front yards. They also are hearing from residents worried about possible long-term health risks. Until now, much of the cell equipment that emits radio-frequency energy has been housed on large towers typically kept hundreds of feet from homes. The new \"small cell\" technology uses far more antennas and transmitters that are smaller and lower-powered, but clustered closer together and lower to the ground. Over the next several years, [industry leaders] expect to deploy as many as 300,000 small cell sites nationwide - about the same number of cell sites installed over the past 35 years. **Under federal law, local governments may not reject a cell facility application for health reasons as long as the equipment meets FCC standards** for radio-frequency radiation emissions. Some local officials say they are concerned those limits, which were set in 1996, could be outdated for wireless equipment closer to homes. **Note:** The FCC is in the process of passing laws which [prevent local governments](https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2018/09/17/naco-prompts-county-action-to-comment-on-fcc-small-cell-order/) from passing laws restricting access to 5G equipment, even though some studies are showing it is hazardous to human health.

Studies of the sites show high incidences of cancer, brain haemorrhages and high blood pressure within a radius of 400 yards of mobile phone masts. **One of the studies, in Warwickshire, showed a cluster of 31 cancers around a single street. A quarter of the 30 staff at a special school within sight of the 90ft high mast have developed tumours since 2000, while another quarter have suffered significant health problems.** Phone masts have provoked protests throughout Britain with thousands of people objecting each week to planning applications. There are about 47,000 masts in the UK. Dr John Walker, a scientist who compiled the cluster studies with the help of local campaigners in Devon, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire and the West Midlands, said he was convinced they showed a potential link between the angle of the beam of radiation emitted from the masts' antennae and illnesses discovered in local populations. \"Masts should be moved away from conurbations and schools and the power turned down,\" he said.

After just one hour of screen time, children and adolescents may have less curiosity, lower self-control and lower emotional stability, which can lead to an increased risk of anxiety and depression, claims a US [study](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211335518301827) published in the journal *Preventive Medicine Reports*. The researchers found that those aged 14 to 17 are more at risk for such adverse effects, but noticed the correlations in younger children and toddlers, whose brains are still developing, as well. **The study found that nursery school children who used screens frequently were twice as likely to lose their temper. It also claimed that nine per cent of those aged 11 to 13 who spent an hour a day on screens were not curious in learning new things**, a figure which rose to 22.6 per cent for those whose screen time was seven hours a day or more. Authors Professor Jean Twenge, of San Diego State University, and Professor Keith Campbell, of the University of Georgia, said: \"Half of mental health problems develop by adolescence. \"Thus, there is an acute need to identify factors linked to mental health issues that are amenable to intervention in this population, as most antecedents are difficult or impossible to influence. \"Compared to these more intractable antecedents of mental health, how children and adolescents spend their leisure time is more amenable to change.\" **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on health](https://www.wanttoknow.info/healthnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **Avoiding EMF radiation not as easy as quitting smoking** **2017-12-21, *San Francisco Chronicle* (San Francisco's leading newspaper)** [https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Avoiding-EMF-radiation-not-as-eas...](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Avoiding-EMF-radiation-not-as-easy-as-quitting-12449120.php) How much more proof do we need that being online isn't healthy for us?

Cell phones, cordless phones and other wireless devices, appliances, power lines, smart-meter networks and cell towers generate non-ionizing radiation from magnetic fields.

Cell phone radiation, measured in radio-frequency exposure, is regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

There are ... gaps in cell phone radiation testing. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, recently [urged the FCC](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7520941318) to begin taking child users of cellphones into account. **Radiation from cell phones is not an Apple-only problem, of course.

I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why. But as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction. I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain. And we then imposed that on the rest of the world.** It's a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer because we believed that would deter them;** it would give them an incentive to stop. A few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working? And is there a better way out there that we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, but I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for. So I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:0:b59b214d26b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10526, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "them. I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working? And is there a better way out there that we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, but I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for. So I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them to see if I could learn from them. I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them (it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances) to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. **The thing I realized that really blew my mind is almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong. And if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies. ** But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew. Let's think about this middle row here [in the audience]. Imagine all of you for 20 days went off and used heroin three times a day. Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect. (Laughter) Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment. Imagine you did that. What would happen? Now we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century. We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, and as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks. You'd start to physically need them. And at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right? That's what I thought. The first thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me that if I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine. Diamorphine is heroin. It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.

Diamorphine is heroin. It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure. And you'll be given this for quite a long period of time. If what we believe about addiction is right and those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks, what should happen? They should become addicts. This has been studied carefully. But it doesn't happen. You may have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter) When I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told. With everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right... until I met a man called Bruce Alexander. He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment that I think really helps us to understand this issue. Professor Alexander explained to me that the story of addiction we've all got in our heads comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century. They're really simple. You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat. You put it in a cage. And you give it two water bottles. One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right? That's how we think it works. In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment, and he noticed something. He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage. It's got nothing to do except use these drugs. Let's try something different. **So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called \"Rat Park,\" which is basically heaven for rats. They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels. And crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex. And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water. But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water. They almost never use it.** **None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. ** When he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought maybe this is just a thing about rats. They're quite different to us. But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at that time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:2:a291f8a90254", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10528, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "ever use it compulsively.

They're quite different to us. But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at that time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin. If you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried. They thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends. It made total sense. **Those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home. The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal. 95 percent of them just stopped. ** If you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense. But Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction. He said, **what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment? ** Looking at this, another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands said maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bonding. **Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we bond and connect with each other. But if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.** Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature. That's what we want as human beings. At first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around. But here's one way that helped me to think about it. I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and you have bottles of water with you, too. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. All of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk - I might after this - (Laughter) - but we're not. Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months. But you're not going to do that. And the reason you're not going to do that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:3:c2a071153fff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10529, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "All of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months. But you're not going to do that. And the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you. It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for. You've got work you love. You've got people you love. You've got healthy relationships. And **a core part of addiction is about not being able to bear to be present in your life. ** Now, this has really significant implications. The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs. In Arizona, I went out with a group of women prisoners who were made to wear T-shirts saying, \"I was a drug addict\" and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeered at them. When those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again. Now that's a very extreme example, but actually** almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that. We punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records. We put barriers between them reconnecting. **There was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. There's a place that decided to do the exact opposite. I went there to see how it worked. In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing. Every year, they tried the American way more and more. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more. And every year the problem got worse. One day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together and basically said, \"Look. We can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts. Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.\" And so they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão to look at all the new evidence. And the panel came back and said, \"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but\" - and this is the crucial next step - \"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society.\" That's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:4:e497b3de9b26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10530, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.\" And so they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão to look at all the new evidence. And the panel came back and said, \"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but\" - and this is the crucial next step - \"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society.\" That's not what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain. So they do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy that does have some value. **But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program of job creation for addicts and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. **So say you used to be a mechanic. When you're ready, they'll go to a garage and they'll say, \"if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.\" The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. **When I went and met the addicts in Portugal, what they said is that as they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.** **It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began. And the results are in: According to the *British Journal of Criminology* injecting drug use is down in Portugal by 50 percent: five-zero percent. Overdose is massively down. HIV is massively down among addicts. Addiction in every study is significantly down. One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system. ** Now, that's the political implications. I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that. We live in a culture where people feel increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating. Before today's TED Talk began - you guys know this - we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on. And I have to say a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours. (Laughter) It might sound weird to say that I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely. But **I increasingly began to think that the connections we have, or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection. ** **If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something. It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:5:bcf466d45436", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10531, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "say that I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.

It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you. It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round. It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured, face-to-face relationships with.** There's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer, that tells us a lot about this. It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis. That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s. Yet the amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing. That's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture. We've traded floorspace for friends. We've traded stuff for connections. And the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been. Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery, and it's right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more about social recovery. **Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals, but as a group. We've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park. ** If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into this. I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff. I wanted to know how to help the people I love. When I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life. And if we're really candid, it's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know addicts in this room. You are angry at them a lot of the time. I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, \"I wish someone would just stop you.\" The kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by the reality show \"Intervention.\" If you've ever seen the show, it's got a pretty simple premise. Get an addict and all the people in their life, gather them together, confront them with what they're doing, and they all", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__addiction-healing.txt:6:f13c675b36b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10532, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__addiction-healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__addiction-healing", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "of us, right?

Get an addict and all the people in their life, gather them together, confront them with what they're doing, and they all say, \"if you don't shape up, we're going to cut you off.\" So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it. They make it contingent on the addict behaving the way *they* want. And I began to see why that approach doesn't work. I began to think that's almost like importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives. So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese? What I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently and I can't tell you it's easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen my connection with them. I say to them, \"I love you whether you're using or you're not. I love you whatever state you're in. And if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you, and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone.\" **The core of that message - you're not alone, we love you - has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually. For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts. I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection**. Thank you. *** **Note:** This is a transcription of a TED Talk given in June of 2015.

I'm less concerned with having the right or wrong answers. My concern is having the right questions.\"** ~~ Jennifer Sharp, filmmaker and director of the landmark documentary *Anecdotals* Dear online world, The signs are everywhere that we live in a society seemingly incapable of civil dialogue, and where competing narratives about complex issues give rise to unprecedented levels of polarization and cancel culture. This is especially true for issues related to the COVID-19 vaccine, where political bias infects much of mainstream and independent media today, impairing our ability to think outside of our own echo chambers. On one hand, the official narrative promotes the vaccine and its effectiveness in mitigating harm caused by the virus. This narrative tells a story that vaccine injuries are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks according to some studies. On the other hand, a growing number of people are raising concerns about the vaccine that reveal a complex web of flawed studies, deeper political agendas, lack of transparency, blatant censorship, and untold stories of vaccine injuries that are more common than we might think. A democratic culture can be defined as one that invites open debate of different views, promotes transparency, and most importantly, builds trust. However, the culture and information wars playing out in society have generated ferocious argument, yet very little clarity about how we can engage with each other in the face of conflicting information on vital public health issues. **Yet what if we *can* have a nuanced debate that centers compassion and inquiry? ** Award-winning director and filmmaker Jennifer Sharp received her Pfizer shot in March 2021 and became ill with electric shocks, muscle weakness, and numbness in the face for months after her first dose. **Realizing that she was amongst a growing body of people who were significantly harmed by the vaccine, Sharp recently produced a powerful documentary called[*Anecdotals*](https://www.anecdotalsmovie.com/), that raises important questions and perspectives left out in the mainstream press about the COVID-19 vaccine. ** *Anecdotals* follows the lives of many people who stepped up to get vaccinated for themselves or the greater good, yet whose lives changed drastically as a result.

SV40 was discovered in 1960. Soon afterward, the virus was found in **polio** vaccine. More than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of **polio** vaccine from 1955 to 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; it has been estimated that 10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of vaccine. SV40 virus has been found in certain types of **cancer** in humans, but it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers. The majority of scientific evidence suggests that SV40-contaminated vaccine did not cause **cancer**; however, some research results are conflicting and more studies are needed. **Polio** vaccines being used today do not contain SV40. All of the current evidence indicates that **polio** vaccines have been free of SV40 since 1963. Additional Facts In the 1950s, rhesus monkey kidney cells, which contain SV40 if the animal is infected, were used in preparing **polio** vaccines. Because SV40 was not discovered until 1960, no one was aware in the 1950s that **polio** vaccine could be contaminated. SV40 was found in the injected form of the **polio** vaccine (IPV), not the kind given by mouth (OPV). Not all doses of IPV were contaminated. It has been estimated that 10-30 million people actually received a vaccine that contained SV40. Some evidence suggests that receipt of SV40-contaminated **polio** vaccine may increase risk of **cancer**.

Now that the rope has snapped, do we tie its ends back together, or shall we undo its dangling braids still further, to see what we might weave from them? **Covid-19 is showing us that when humanity is united in common cause, phenomenally rapid change is possible.** None of the world's problems are technically difficult to solve; they originate in human disagreement. In coherency, humanity's creative powers are boundless. A few months ago, a proposal to halt commercial air travel would have seemed preposterous. Likewise for the radical changes we are making in our social behavior, economy, and the role of government in our lives. Covid demonstrates the power of our collective will when we agree on what is important. What else might we achieve, in coherency? What do we want to achieve, and what world shall we create?

That is always the next question when anyone awakens to their power. Covid-19 is like a rehab intervention that breaks the addictive hold of normality. To interrupt a habit is to make it visible; it is to turn it from a compulsion to a choice. **When the crisis subsides, we might have occasion to ask whether we want to return to normal, or whether there might be something we've seen during this break in the routines that we want to bring into the future. ** We might ask, after so many have lost their jobs, whether all of them are the jobs the world most needs, and whether our labor and creativity would be better applied elsewhere. We might ask, having done without it for a while, whether we really need so much air travel, Disneyworld vacations, or trade shows. **What parts of the economy will we want to restore, and what parts might we choose to let go of? And on a darker note, what among the things that are being taken away right now - civil liberties, freedom of assembly, sovereignty over our bodies, in-person gatherings, hugs, handshakes, and public life - might we need to exert intentional political and personal will to restore?****** For most of my life, I have had the feeling that humanity was nearing a crossroads. Always, the crisis, the collapse, the break was imminent, just around the bend, but it didn't come and it didn't come. Imagine walking a road, and up ahead you see it, you see the crossroads. It's just over the hill, around the bend, past the woods. Cresting the hill, you see you were mistaken, it was a mirage, it was farther away than you thought. You keep walking. Sometimes it comes into view, sometimes it disappears from sight and it seems like this road goes on forever. Maybe there isn't a crossroads. No, there it is again! Always it is almost here. Never is it here. Now, all of a sudden, we go around a bend and here it is. We stop, hardly able to believe that now it is happening, hardly able to believe, after years of confinement to the road of our predecessors, that now we finally have a choice. We are right to stop, stunned at the newness of our situation. Because of the hundred paths that radiate out in front of us, some lead in the same direction we've already been headed.

There is a strong argument for social distancing in the near term: to prevent a sudden surge of Covid cases from overwhelming the medical system. I would like to put that argument in a larger context, especially as we look to the long term. Lest we institutionalize distancing and reengineer society around it, let us be aware of what choice we are making and why. The same goes for the other changes happening around the coronavirus epidemic. **Some commentators have observed how it plays neatly into an agenda of totalitarian control. A frightened public accepts [abridgments of civil liberties](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-we-cant-let-coronavirus-lead-a-911style-erosion-civil-liberties) that are otherwise hard to justify, such as the [tracking of everyone's movements at all times](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-coronavirus-brings-chinas-surveillance-state-out-the-shadows), forcible medical treatment, involuntary quarantine, restrictions on travel and the freedom of assembly, censorship of what the authorities deem to be disinformation, [suspension of habeas corpus](https://www.newsweek.com/barr-power-grab-habeas-corpus-1494304), and military policing of civilians. Many of these were underway before Covid-19; since its advent, they have been irresistible. ** The same goes for the automation of commerce; the transition from participation in sports and entertainment to remote viewing; the migration of life from public to private spaces; the transition away from place-based schools toward online education, the decline of brick-and-mortar stores, and the movement of human work and leisure onto screens. Covid-19 is accelerating preexisting trends, political, economic, and social. **While all the above are, in the short term, justified on the grounds of flattening the curve (the epidemiological growth curve), we are also hearing a lot about a \"new normal\"; that is to say, the changes may not be temporary at all.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:2:8284b5aef8ea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10553, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "public to private spaces; the transition away from place-based schools toward online education, the decline of brick-and-mortar stores, and the movement of human work and leisure onto screens.

Since the threat of infectious disease, like the threat of terrorism, never goes away, control measures can easily become permanent. ** If we were going in this direction anyway, the current justification must be part of a deeper impulse. I will analyze this impulse in two parts: the reflex of control, and the war on death. Thus understood, an initiatory opportunity emerges, one that we are seeing already in the form of the solidarity, compassion, and care that Covid-19 has inspired. **The Reflex of Control** At the current writing, official statistics say that about 25,000 people have died from Covid-19. By the time it runs its course, the death toll could be ten times or a hundred times bigger, or even, if the most alarming guesses are right, a thousand times bigger. Each one of these people has loved ones, family and friends. Compassion and conscience call us to do what we can to avert unnecessary tragedy. This is personal for me: my own infinitely dear but frail mother is among the most vulnerable to a disease that kills mostly the aged and the infirm. What will the final numbers be? That question is impossible to answer at the time of this writing. Early reports were alarming; for weeks the official number from Wuhan, circulated endlessly in the media, was a shocking 3.4%. That, coupled with its highly contagious nature, pointed to tens of millions of deaths worldwide, or even as many as 100 million. More recently, estimates have plunged as it has become apparent that most cases are mild or asymptomatic. Since testing has been skewed towards the seriously ill, the death rate has looked artificially high. In South Korea, where hundreds of thousands of people with mild symptoms have been tested, the reported case fatality rate is around 1%. In [Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts), whose testing also extends to many with mild symptoms, the fatality rate is 0.4%. [A recent paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/24/science.abb3221) in the journal Science argues that 86% of infections have been undocumented, which points to a much lower mortality rate than the current case fatality rate would indicate. **The story of the [Diamond Princess](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-death-rate) cruise ship bolsters this view. Of the 3,711 people on board, about 20% have tested positive for the virus; less than half of those had symptoms, and eight have died. **A cruise ship is a perfect setting for contagion, and there was plenty of time for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:3:cd7e16c719a4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10554, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "in the journal Science argues that 86% of infections have been undocumented, which points to a much lower mortality rate than the current case fatality rate would indicate. **The story of the [Diamond Princess](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-death-rate) cruise ship bolsters this view.

Furthermore, the cruise ship's population was heavily skewed (as are most cruise ships) [toward the elderly](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773v2.full.pdf): nearly a third of the passengers were over age 70, and more than half were over age 60. A research team [concluded](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773v2) from the large number of asymptomatic cases that the true fatality rate in China is around 0.5%. That is still five times higher than flu. Based on the above (and adjusting for much younger demographics in Africa and South and Southeast Asia) my guess is about 200,000-300,000 deaths in the US - more if the medical system is overwhelmed, less if infections are spread out over time - and 3 million globally. Those are serious numbers. **Not since the [Hong Kong Flu](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hong-Kong-flu-of-1968) pandemic of 1968/9 has the world experienced anything like it.** My guesses could easily be off by an order of magnitude. Every day the media reports the total number of Covid-19 cases, but no one has any idea what the true number is, because only a tiny proportion of the population has been tested. If tens of millions have the virus, asymptomatically, we would not know it. Further complicating the matter is the high rate of [false positives](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32133832/) for existing testing, possibly as high as 80%. (And [see here](https://www.sott.net/article/431559-First-Do-No-Harm-If-Primary-Healthcare-Remains-Shut-Down-Toll-on-Elderly-Will-be-Worse-Than-COVID-19) for even more alarming uncertainties about test accuracy.) **Let me repeat: no one knows what is really happening, including me. Let us be aware of two contradictory tendencies in human affairs. The first is the tendency for hysteria to feed on itself, to exclude data points that don't play into the fear, and to create the world in its image. The second is denial, the irrational rejection of information that might disrupt normalcy and comfort. As [Daniel Schmactenberger asks](https://m.facebook.com/notes/daniel-schmachtenberger/mind-viruses-during-a-pandemic/10156663879545213/), How do you know what you believe is true?** In the face of the uncertainty, I'd like to make a prediction: The crisis will play out so that we never will know. If the final death tally, which will itself be the subject of dispute, is lower than feared, some will say that is because the controls worked. Others will say it is because the disease wasn't as dangerous as we were told. To me, the most baffling puzzle is why at the present writing there seem to be no new cases in China.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:4:24ace301fc35", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10555, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "uncertainty, I'd like to make a prediction: The crisis will play out so that we never will know.

Others will say it is because the disease wasn't as dangerous as we were told. To me, the most baffling puzzle is why at the present writing there seem to be no new cases in China. The government didn't initiate its lockdown until well after the virus was established. It should have spread widely during Chinese New Year when, even though some internal travel restrictions had been put in place around the epicenter of Wuhan, most planes, trains, and buses were still packed with people traveling all over the country. What is going on here? Again, I don't know, and neither do you. **Whether the final global death toll is 100,000, 500,000 or 5 million, let's look at some other numbers to get some perspective. My point is NOT that Covid isn't so bad and we shouldn't do anything. Bear with me. Last year, [according to the FAO](http://www.fao.org/zhc/hunger-facts/en/), five million children worldwide died of hunger (among 162 million who are stunted and 51 million who are wasted). That is 100 times more people than have died so far from Covid-19, yet no government has declared a state of emergency or asked that we radically alter our way of life to save them. ** Nor do we see a comparable level of alarm and action around suicide - the mere tip of an iceberg of despair and depression - which kills over a million people a year globally and 50,000 in the USA. Or drug overdoses, which kill 70,000 in the USA, the autoimmunity epidemic, which affects 23.5 million (NIH figure) to 50 million (AARDA), or obesity, which afflicts well over 100 million. Why, for that matter, are we not in a frenzy about averting nuclear armageddon or ecological collapse, but, to the contrary, pursue choices that magnify those very dangers? Please, the point here is not that we haven't changed our ways to stop children from starving, so we shouldn't change them for Covid either. It is the contrary: If we can change so radically for Covid-19, we can do it for these other conditions too. Let us ask why are we able to unify our collective will to stem this virus, but not to address other grave threats to humanity. Why, until now, has society been so frozen in its existing trajectory? The answer is revealing. Simply, **in the face of world hunger, addiction, autoimmunity, suicide, or ecological collapse, we as a society do not know what to do. Our go-to crisis responses, all of which are some version of control, aren't very effective in addressing these conditions**. Now along comes a contagious epidemic, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:5:9f35dbec82b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10556, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "collective will to stem this virus, but not to address other grave threats to humanity.

Simply, **in the face of world hunger, addiction, autoimmunity, suicide, or ecological collapse, we as a society do not know what to do. Our go-to crisis responses, all of which are some version of control, aren't very effective in addressing these conditions**. Now along comes a contagious epidemic, and finally we can spring into action. It is a crisis for which control works: quarantines, lockdowns, isolation, hand-washing; control of movement, control of information, control of our bodies. That makes Covid a convenient receptacle for our inchoate fears, a place to channel our growing sense of helplessness in the face of the changes overtaking the world. Covid-19 is a threat that we know how to meet. Unlike so many of our other fears, Covid-19 offers a plan. Our civilization's established institutions are increasingly helpless to meet the challenges of our time. How they welcome a challenge that they finally can meet. How eager they are to embrace it as a paramount crisis. How naturally their systems of information management select for the most alarming portrayals of it. **How easily the public joins the panic, embracing a threat that the authorities can handle as a proxy for the various unspeakable threats that they cannot.** Today, most of our challenges no longer succumb to force. Our antibiotics and surgery fail to meet the surging health crises of autoimmunity, addiction, and obesity. Our guns and bombs, built to conquer armies, are useless to erase hatred abroad or keep domestic violence out of our homes. Our police and prisons cannot heal the breeding conditions of crime. Our pesticides cannot restore ruined soil. Covid-19 recalls the good old days when the challenges of infectious diseases succumbed to modern medicine and hygiene, at the same time as the Nazis succumbed to the war machine, and nature itself succumbed, or so it seemed, to technological conquest and improvement. It recalls the days when our weapons worked and the world seemed indeed to be improving with each technology of control. What kind of problem succumbs to domination and control? The kind caused by something from the outside, something Other. When the cause of the problem is something intimate to ourselves, like homelessness or inequality, addiction or obesity, there is nothing to war against. We may try to install an enemy, blaming, for example, the billionaires, Vladimir Putin, or the Devil, but then we miss key information, such as the ground conditions that allow billionaires (or viruses) to replicate in the first place. **If there is one thing our civilization is good at, it is fighting an enemy. We welcome opportunities to do what we are good at, which prove the validity of our technologies, systems, and worldview.

We welcome opportunities to do what we are good at, which prove the validity of our technologies, systems, and worldview. And so, we manufacture enemies, cast problems like crime, terrorism, and disease into us-versus-them terms, and mobilize our collective energies toward those endeavors that can be seen that way. Thus, we single out Covid-19 as a call to arms, reorganizing society as if for a war effort, while treating as normal the possibility of nuclear armageddon, ecological collapse, and five million children starving.** **The Conspiracy Narrative** **Because Covid-19 seems to justify so many items on the totalitarian wish list, there are those who believe it to be a [deliberate power play](https://londonreal.tv/the-truth-behind-the-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-lockdown-the-economic-crash-david-icke/). It is not my purpose to advance that theory nor to debunk it, although I will offer some meta-level comments**. First a brief overview. **The theories (there are many variants) talk about [Event 201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174) (sponsored by the Gates Foundation, CIA, etc. last September [and [involving a coronavirus](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/what-we-can-learn-from-a-pandemic-tabletop-exercise/)]), and a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation white paper detailing a scenario called \"Lockstep,\" both of which lay out the authoritarian response to a hypothetical pandemic. They observe that the infrastructure, technology, and legislative framework for martial law has been in preparation for many years.** All that was needed, they say, was a way to make the public embrace it, and now that has come. Whether or not current controls are permanent, a precedent is being set for: The tracking of people's movements at all times (because coronavirus) The suspension of freedom of assembly (because coronavirus) The military policing of civilians (because coronavirus) Extrajudicial, indefinite detention (quarantine, because coronavirus) The banning of cash (because coronavirus) Censorship of the Internet (to combat disinformation, because coronavirus) Compulsory vaccination and other medical treatment, establishing the state's sovereignty over our bodies (because coronavirus) The classification of all activities and destinations into the expressly permitted and the expressly forbidden (you can leave your house for this, but not that), eliminating the un-policed, non-juridical gray zone. That totality is the very essence of totalitarianism. Necessary now though, because, well, coronavirus. This is juicy material for conspiracy theories. For all I know, one of those theories could be true; however, the same progression of events could unfold from an unconscious systemic tilt toward ever-increasing control. Where does this tilt come from? It is woven into civilization's DNA. **For millennia, civilization (as opposed to small-scale traditional cultures) has understood progress as a matter of extending control onto the world: domesticating the wild, conquering the barbarians, mastering the forces of nature, and ordering society", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:7:76d632e565ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10558, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "is juicy material for conspiracy theories.

It is woven into civilization's DNA. **For millennia, civilization (as opposed to small-scale traditional cultures) has understood progress as a matter of extending control onto the world: domesticating the wild, conquering the barbarians, mastering the forces of nature, and ordering society according to law and reason. ** The ascent of control accelerated with the Scientific Revolution, which launched \"progress\" to new heights: the ordering of reality into objective categories and quantities, and the mastering of materiality with technology. Finally, the social sciences promised to use the same means and methods to fulfill the ambition (which goes back to Plato and Confucius) to engineer a perfect society. **Those who administer civilization will therefore welcome any opportunity to strengthen their control, for after all, it is in service to a grand vision of human destiny: the perfectly ordered world, in which disease, crime, poverty, and perhaps suffering itself can be engineered out of existence. No nefarious motives are necessary. Of course they would like to keep track of everyone - all the better to ensure the common good. **For them, Covid-19 shows how necessary that is. \"Can we afford democratic freedoms in light of the coronavirus?\" they ask. \"Must we now, out of necessity, sacrifice those for our own safety?\" It is a familiar refrain, for it has accompanied other crises in the past, like 9/11. To rework a common metaphor, imagine a man with a hammer, stalking around looking for a reason to use it. Suddenly he sees a nail sticking out. He's been looking for a nail for a long time, pounding on screws and bolts and not accomplishing much. He inhabits a worldview in which hammers are the best tools, and the world can be made better by pounding in the nails. And here is a nail! We might suspect that in his eagerness he has placed the nail there himself, but it hardly matters. Maybe it isn't even a nail that's sticking out, but it resembles one enough to start pounding. When the tool is at the ready, an opportunity will arise to use it. And I will add, for those inclined to doubt the authorities, maybe this time it really is a nail. In that case, the hammer is the right tool - and the principle of the hammer will emerge the stronger, ready for the screw, the button, the clip, and the tear. Either way, the problem we deal with here is much deeper than that of overthrowing an evil coterie of Illuminati.

Even if they do exist, given the tilt of civilization, the same trend would persist without them, or a new Illuminati would arise to assume the functions of the old. True or false, the idea that the epidemic is some monstrous plot perpetrated by evildoers upon the public is not so far from the mindset of find-the-pathogen. It is a crusading mentality, a war mentality. **It locates the source of a sociopolitical illness in a pathogen against which we may then fight, a victimizer separate from ourselves. It risks ignoring the conditions that make society fertile ground for the plot to take hold. Whether that ground was sown deliberately or by the wind is, for me, a secondary question.** What I will say next is relevant whether or not Covid-19 is a genetically engineered bioweapon, is [related to 5G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh1T4c3wP8I&app=desktop) rollout, is being used to prevent \"[disclosure](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up10pg),\" is a Trojan horse for totalitarian world government, is more deadly than we've been told, is less deadly than we've been told, originated in a Wuhan biolab, originated at [Fort Detrick](https://asiatimes.com/2020/03/china-locked-in-hybrid-war-with-us/), or is exactly as the CDC and WHO have been telling us. It applies even if [everyone is totally wrong](http://theinfectiousmyth.com/book/CoronavirusPanic.pdf) about the role of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the current epidemic. **I have my opinions, but if there is one thing I have learned through the course of this emergency, it is that I don't really know what is happening. I don't see how anyone can, amidst the seething farrago of news, fake news, rumors, suppressed information, conspiracy theories, propaganda, and politicized narratives that fill the Internet. I wish a lot more people would embrace not knowing.** I say that both to those who embrace the dominant narrative, as well as to those who hew to dissenting ones. What information might we be blocking out, in order to maintain the integrity of our viewpoints? Let's be humble in our beliefs: it is a matter of life and death. **The War on Death** **My 7-year-old son hasn't seen or played with another child for two weeks. Millions of others are in the same boat. Most would agree that a month without social interaction for all those children is a reasonable sacrifice to save a million lives. But how about to save 100,000 lives? And what if the sacrifice is not for a month but for a year? Five years**?

Let's replace the foregoing questions with something more personal, that pierces the inhuman utilitarian thinking that turns people into statistics and sacrifices some of them for something else. The relevant question for me is, Would I ask all the nation's children to forego play for a season, if it would reduce my mother's risk of dying, or for that matter, my own risk? Or I might ask, Would I decree the end of human hugging and handshakes, if it would save my own life? This is not to devalue Mom's life or my own, both of which are precious. I am grateful for every day she is still with us. But these questions bring up deep issues. What is the right way to live? What is the right way to die? The answer to such questions, whether asked on behalf of oneself or on behalf of society at large, depends on how we hold death and how much we value play, touch, and togetherness, along with civil liberties and personal freedom. There is no easy formula to balance these values. **Over my lifetime I've seen society place more and more emphasis on safety, security, and risk reduction. It has especially impacted childhood: as a young boy it was normal for us to roam a mile from home unsupervised - behavior that would earn parents a visit from Child Protective Services today. It also manifests in the form of latex gloves for more and more professions; hand sanitizer everywhere; locked, guarded, and surveilled school buildings; intensified airport and border security; heightened awareness of legal liability and liability insurance; metal detectors and searches before entering many sports arenas and public buildings, and so on. Writ large, it takes the form of the security state.** **The mantra \"safety first\" comes from a value system that makes survival top priority, and that depreciates other values like fun, adventure, play, and the challenging of limits.** Other cultures had different priorities. For instance, many traditional and indigenous cultures are much less protective of children, as documented in Jean Liedloff's classic, *The Continuum Concept*. They allow them risks and responsibilities that would seem insane to most modern people, believing that this is necessary for children to develop self-reliance and good judgment. I think most modern people, especially younger people, retain some of this inherent willingness to sacrifice safety in order to live life fully. The surrounding culture, however, lobbies us relentlessly to live in fear, and has constructed systems that embody fear.

The surrounding culture, however, lobbies us relentlessly to live in fear, and has constructed systems that embody fear. In them, staying safe is over-ridingly important. Thus we have a medical system in which most decisions are based on calculations of risk, and in which the worst possible outcome, marking the physician's ultimate failure, is death. Yet all the while, we know that death awaits us regardless. A life saved actually means a death postponed. The ultimate fulfillment of civilization's program of control would be to triumph over death itself. Failing that, modern society settles for a facsimile of that triumph: denial rather than conquest. Ours is a society of death denial, from its hiding away of corpses, to its fetish for youthfulness, to its warehousing of old people in nursing homes. Even its obsession with money and property - extensions of the self, as the word \"mine\" indicates - expresses the delusion that the impermanent self can be made permanent through its attachments. All this is inevitable given the story-of-self that modernity offers: the separate individual in a world of Other. Surrounded by genetic, social, and economic competitors, that self must protect and dominate in order to thrive. It must do everything it can to forestall death, which (in the story of separation) is total annihilation. Biological science has even taught us that our very nature is to maximize our chances of surviving and reproducing. I asked a friend, a medical doctor who has spent time with the Q'ero on Peru, whether the Q'ero would (if they could) intubate someone to prolong their life. \"Of course not,\" she said. \"They would summon the shaman to help him die well.\" Dying well (which isn't necessarily the same as dying painlessly) is not much in today's medical vocabulary. No hospital records are kept on whether patients die well. That would not be counted as a positive outcome. In the world of the separate self, death is the ultimate catastrophe. But is it? **Consider [this perspectiv](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lissarankin/posts/)e from Dr. Lissa Rankin: \"Not all of us would want to be in an ICU, isolated from loved ones with a machine breathing for us, at risk of dying alone - even if it means they might increase their chance of survival.

[Death is going home](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/tc09a).\"** When the self is understood as relational, interdependent, even inter-existent, then it bleeds over into the other, and the other bleeds over into the self. Understanding the self as a locus of consciousness in a matrix of relationship, one no longer searches for an enemy as the key to understanding every problem, but looks instead for imbalances in relationships. **The War on Death gives way to the quest to live well and fully, and we see that fear of death is actually fear of life. How much of life will we forego to stay safe?** Totalitarianism - the perfection of control - is the inevitable end product of the mythology of the separate self. What else but a threat to life, like a war, would merit total control? Thus Orwell identified perpetual war as a crucial component of the Party's rule. Against the backdrop of the program of control, death denial, and the separate self, the assumption that public policy should seek to minimize the number of deaths is nearly beyond question, a goal to which other values like play, freedom, etc. are subordinate. Covid-19 offers occasion to broaden that view. Yes, let us hold life sacred, more sacred than ever. Death teaches us that. Let us hold each person, young or old, sick or well, as the sacred, precious, beloved being that they are. And in the circle of our hearts, let us make room for other sacred values too. **To hold life sacred is not just to live long, it is to live well and right and fully.** Like all fear, the fear around the coronavirus hints at what might lie beyond it. Anyone who has experienced the passing of someone close knows that death is a portal to love. Covid-19 has elevated death to prominence in the consciousness of a society that denies it. On the other side of the fear, we can see the love that death liberates. Let it pour forth. Let it saturate the soil of our culture and fill its aquifers so that it seeps up through the cracks of our crusted institutions, our systems, and our habits. Some of these may die too. **What world shall we live in?** **How much of life do we want to sacrifice at the altar of security?

Do we want to be medically examined every time we travel, if that will save some number of lives a year? Are we willing to accept the medicalization of life in general, handing over final sovereignty over our bodies to medical authorities (as selected by political ones)? Do we want every event to be a virtual event? How much are we willing to live in fear? **Covid-19 will eventually subside, but the threat of infectious disease is permanent. Our response to it sets a course for the future.** Public life, communal life, the life of shared physicality has been dwindling over several generations. Instead of shopping at stores, we get things delivered to our homes. Instead of packs of kids playing outside, we have play dates and digital adventures. Instead of the public square, we have the online forum. Do we want to continue to insulate ourselves still further from each other and the world? It is not hard to imagine, especially if social distancing is successful, that Covid-19 persists beyond the 18 months we are being told to expect for it to run its course. It is not hard to imagine that new viruses will emerge during that time. It is not hard to imagine that emergency measures will become normal (so as to forestall the possibility of another outbreak), just as the state of emergency declared after 9/11 is still in effect today. It is not hard to imagine that (as we are being told), reinfection is possible, so that the disease will never run its course. That means that the temporary changes in our way of life may become permanent. **To reduce the risk of another pandemic, shall we choose to live in a society without hugs, handshakes, and high-fives, forever more?** Shall we choose to live in a society where we no longer gather en masse? Shall the concert, the sports competition, and the festival be a thing of the past? Shall children no longer play with other children? Shall all human contact be mediated by computers and masks? No more dance classes, no more karate classes, no more conferences, no more churches? Is death reduction to be the standard by which to measure progress? Does human advancement mean separation?

The same question applies to the administrative tools required to control the movement of people and the flow of information. **At the present writing, the entire country is moving toward lockdown. In some countries, one must print out a form from a government website in order to leave the house.** It reminds me of school, where one's location must be authorized at all times. Or of prison. Do we envision a future of electronic hall passes, a system where freedom of movement is governed by state administrators and their software at all times, permanently? Where every movement is tracked, either permitted or prohibited? And, for our protection, where information that threatens our health (as decided, again, by various authorities) is censored for our own good? In the face of an emergency, like unto a state of war, we accept such restrictions and temporarily surrender our freedoms. Similar to 9/11, Covid-19 trumps all objections. For the first time in history, the technological means exist to realize such a vision, at least in the developed world (for example, [using cellphone location data](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/u-s-wants-smartphone-location-data-fight-coronavirus-privacy-advocates-n1162821) to enforce social distancing; [see also here](https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/)). After a bumpy transition, we could live in a society where nearly all of life happens online: shopping, meeting, entertainment, socializing, working, even dating. Is that what we want? How many lives saved is that worth? I am sure that many of the controls in effect today will be partially relaxed in a few months. Partially relaxed, but at the ready. As long as infectious disease remains with us, they are likely to be reimposed, again and again, in the future, or be self-imposed in the form of habits. As Deborah Tannen says, contributing to a [Politico article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-effect-economy-life-society-analysis-covid-135579) on how coronavirus will change the world permanently, 'We know now that touching things, being with other people and breathing the air in an enclosed space can be risky....

Despite security systems in almost every upper middle-class home, people are no less anxious or insecure than they were a generation ago. Despite elaborate security measures, the schools are not seeing fewer mass shootings. Despite phenomenal progress in medical technology, people have if anything become less healthy over the past thirty years, as chronic disease has proliferated and life expectancy stagnated and, in the USA and Britain, started to decline.** **The measures being instituted to control Covid-19, likewise, may end up causing more suffering and death than they prevent. **Minimizing deaths means minimizing the deaths that we know how to predict and measure. **It is impossible to measure the added deaths that might come from isolation-induced depression, for instance, or the despair caused by unemployment, or the lowered immunity and deterioration in health that [chronic fear](https://www.ajmc.com/conferences/nei-2017/the-effects-of-chronic-fear-on-a-persons-health) can cause. **Loneliness and lack of social contact has been shown to increase [inflammation](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15142), [depression](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/10/30/7-ways-loneliness-and-connectedness-affect-mental-health/#6297c37ce1dc), and [dementia](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20190803/Social-contact-could-play-an-important-role-in-staving-off-dementia.aspx). According to [Lissa Rankin, M.D.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2hLhWSlOl0), air pollution increases risk of dying by 6%, obesity by 23%, alcohol abuse by 37%, and loneliness by 45%. **Another danger that is off the ledger is the deterioration in immunity caused by excessive hygiene and distancing.** It is not only social contact that is necessary for health, it is also contact with the microbial world. Generally speaking, microbes are not our enemies, they are our allies in health. A diverse gut biome, comprising bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and other organisms, is essential for a well-functioning immune system, and its diversity is maintained through contact with other people and with the world of life. **Excessive hand-washing, overuse of antibiotics, aseptic cleanliness, and lack of human contact might do [more harm than good](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/25/5837892/is-being-too-clean-making-us-sick). **The resulting allergies and autoimmune disorders might be worse than the infectious disease they replace.

First, it generates endless war; second, it diverts attention from the ground conditions that breed illness, terrorism, crime, weeds, and the rest.** **Despite politicians' perennial claim that they pursue war for the sake of peace, war inevitably breeds more war.** Bombing countries to kill terrorists not only ignores the ground conditions of terrorism, it exacerbates those conditions. Locking up criminals not only ignores the conditions that breed crime, it creates those conditions when it breaks up families and communities and acculturates the incarcerated to criminality. And regimes of antibiotics, vaccines, antivirals, and other medicines wreak havoc on body ecology, which is the foundation of strong immunity. Outside the body, the massive spraying campaigns sparked by [Zika](https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/zika-and-the-mentality-of-control/), Dengue Fever, and now Covid-19 will visit untold damage upon nature's ecology. Has anyone considered what the effects on the ecosystem will be when we douse it with antiviral compounds? Such a policy (which has been implemented in various places in China and India) is only thinkable from the mindset of separation, which does not understand that viruses are integral to the web of life. To understand the point about ground conditions, consider some mortality [statistics from Italy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) (from its National Health Institute), based on an analysis of hundreds of Covid-19 fatalities. Of those analyzed, less than 1% were free of serious chronic health conditions. Some 75% suffered from hypertension, 35% from diabetes, 33% from cardiac ischemia, 24% from atrial fibrillation, 18% from low renal function, along with other conditions that I couldn't decipher from the [Italian report](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_17_marzo-v2.pdf). Nearly half the deceased had three or more of these serious pathologies. Americans, beset by obesity, diabetes, and other chronic ailments, are at least as vulnerable as Italians. Should we blame the virus then (which killed few otherwise healthy people), or shall we blame underlying poor health? Here again the analogy of the taut rope applies. Millions of people in the modern world are in a precarious state of health, just waiting for something that would normally be trivial to send them over the edge. Of course, in the short term we want to save their lives;** the danger is that we lose ourselves in an endless succession of short terms, fighting one infectious disease after another, and never engage the ground conditions that make people so vulnerable.

That is a much harder problem, because these ground conditions will not change via fighting.** There is no pathogen that causes diabetes or obesity, addiction, depression, or PTSD. Their causes are not an Other, not some virus separate from ourselves, and we its victims. Even in diseases like Covid-19, in which we can name a pathogenic virus, matters are not so simple as a war between virus and victim. There is an alternative to the germ theory of disease that holds germs to be part of a larger process. When conditions are right, they multiply in the body, sometimes killing the host, but also, potentially, improving the conditions that accommodated them to begin with, for example by cleaning out accumulated toxic debris via mucus discharge, or (metaphorically speaking) burning them up with fever.** Sometimes called \"terrain theory,\" it says that germs are more symptom than cause of disease. **As one meme explains it: \"Your fish is sick. Germ theory: isolate the fish. Terrain theory: clean the tank.\" A certain schizophrenia afflicts the modern culture of health. On the one hand, there is a burgeoning wellness movement that embraces alternative and holistic medicine. It advocates herbs, meditation, and yoga to boost immunity. It validates the emotional and spiritual dimensions of health, such as the power of attitudes and beliefs to sicken or to heal. All of this seems to have disappeared under the Covid tsunami, as society defaults to the old orthodoxy. Case in point: California acupuncturists have been forced to shut down, having been deemed \"non-essential.\" This is perfectly understandable from the perspective of conventional virology. But as one acupuncturist on Facebook observed, \"What about my patient who I'm working with to get off opioids for his back pain? He's going to have to start using them again.\" From the worldview of medical authority, alternative modalities, social interaction, yoga classes, supplements, and so on are frivolous when it comes to real diseases caused by real viruses. They are relegated to an etheric realm of \"wellness\" in the face of a crisis. The resurgence of orthodoxy under Covid-19 is so intense that anything remotely unconventional, such as [intravenous vitamin C](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n15.shtml), was completely off the table in the United States until two days ago (articles still abound \"debunking\" the \"myth\" that vitamin C can help fight Covid-19). Nor have I heard the CDC evangelize the benefits of elderberry extract, medicinal mushrooms, cutting sugar intake, NAC (N-acetyl L-cysteine), astragalus, or vitamin D.

Nor have I heard the CDC evangelize the benefits of elderberry extract, medicinal mushrooms, cutting sugar intake, NAC (N-acetyl L-cysteine), astragalus, or vitamin D. These are not just mushy speculation about \"wellness,\" but are supported by extensive research and physiological explanations. For example, NAC ([general info](https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/nutrition/nac-benefits-helps-lung-problems-addictions-autism-bipolar-and-more/), double-blind placebo-controlled [study](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/10/7/1535.long)) has been shown to radically reduce incidence and severity of symptoms in flu-like illnesses. As the statistics I offered earlier on autoimmunity, obesity, etc. indicate, America and the modern world in general are facing a health crisis. Is the answer to do what we've been doing, only more thoroughly? **The response so far to Covid has been to double down on the orthodoxy and sweep unconventional practices and dissenting viewpoints aside. ** **Another response would be to widen our lens and examine the entire system, including who pays for it, how access is granted, and how research is funded, but also expanding out to include marginal fields like herbal medicine, functional medicine, and energy medicine. **Perhaps we can take this opportunity to reevaluate prevailing theories of illness, health, and the body. Yes, let's protect the sickened fish as best we can right now, but maybe next time we won't have to isolate and drug so many fish, if we can clean the tank. I'm not telling you to run out right now and buy NAC or any other supplement, nor that we as a society should abruptly shift our response, cease social distancing immediately, and start taking supplements instead. But **we can use the break in normal, this pause at a crossroads, to consciously choose what path we shall follow moving forward:** what kind of healthcare system, what paradigm of health, what kind of society. This reevaluation is already happening, as ideas like universal free healthcare in the USA gain new momentum. And that path leads to forks as well. What kind of healthcare will be universalized? Will it be merely available to all, or mandatory for all - each citizen a patient, perhaps with an invisible ink barcode tattoo certifying one is up to date on all compulsory vaccines and check-ups. Then you can go to school, board a plane, or enter a restaurant. This is one path to the future that is available to us. **Another option is available now too.

Yes, we can proceed as before down the path toward greater insulation, isolation, domination, and separation. We can normalize heightened levels of separation and control, believing that they are necessary to keep us safe, and accept a world in which we are afraid to be near each other. Or we can take advantage of this pause, this break in normal, to turn onto a path of reunion, of holism, of the restoring of lost connections, of the repair of community and the rejoining of the web of life. **Do we double down on protecting the separate self, or do we accept the invitation into a world where all of us are in this together?** It isn't just in medicine we encounter this question: it visits us politically, economically, and in our personal lives as well. Take for example the issue of hoarding, which embodies the idea, \"There won't be enough for everyone, so I am going to make sure there is enough for me.\" Another response might be, \"Some don't have enough, so I will share what I have with them.\" Are we to be survivalists or helpers? What is life for? On a larger scale, people are asking questions that have until now lurked on activist margins. What should we do about the homeless? What should we do about the people in prisons? In Third World slums? What should we do about the unemployed? What about all the hotel maids, the Uber drivers, the plumbers and janitors and bus drivers and cashiers who cannot work from home? And so now, finally, ideas like student debt relief and universal basic income are blossoming. \"How do we protect those susceptible to Covid?\" invites us into \"How do we care for vulnerable people in general?\" **That is the impulse that stirs in us, regardless of the superficialities of our opinions about Covid's severity, origin, or best policy to address it.

We have the opportunity now to forge a new, more compassionate normal. Hopeful signs abound that this is happening. The United States government, which has long seemed the captive of heartless corporate interests, has unleashed hundreds of billions of dollars in direct payments to families. Donald Trump, not known as a paragon of compassion, has put a moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. Certainly one can take a cynical view of both these developments; nonetheless, they embody the principle of caring for the vulnerable. From all over the world we hear stories of solidarity and healing. One friend described sending $100 each to ten strangers who were in dire need. My son, who until a few days ago worked at Dunkin' Donuts, said people were tipping at five times the normal rate - and these are working class people, many of them Hispanic truck drivers, who are economically insecure themselves. Doctors, nurses, and \"essential workers\" in other professions risk their lives to serve the public.

Universal basic income could mean an end to economic insecurity and the flowering of creativity as millions are freed from the work that Covid has shown us is less necessary than we thought. Or it could mean, with the decimation of small businesses, dependency on the state for a stipend that comes with strict conditions. The crisis could usher in totalitarianism or solidarity; medical martial law or a holistic renaissance; greater fear of the microbial world or greater resiliency in participation in it; permanent norms of social distancing or a renewed desire to come together. What can guide us, as individuals and as a society, as we walk the garden of forking paths? At each junction, we can be aware of what we follow: fear or love, self-preservation or generosity. Shall we live in fear and build a society based on it? Shall we live to preserve our separate selves? Shall we use the crisis as a weapon against our political enemies? These are not all-or-nothing questions, all fear or all love. It is that a next step into love lies before us. It feels daring, but not reckless. It treasures life, while accepting death. And it trusts that with each step, the next will become visible. Please don't think that choosing love over fear can be accomplished solely through an act of will, and that fear too can be conquered like a virus. **The virus we face here is fear, whether it is fear of Covid-19, or fear of the totalitarian response to it,** and this virus too has its terrain. Fear, along with addiction, depression, and a host of physical ills, flourishes in a terrain of separation and trauma: inherited trauma, childhood trauma, violence, war, abuse, neglect, shame, punishment, poverty, and the muted, normalized trauma that affects nearly everyone who lives in a monetized economy, undergoes modern schooling, or lives without community or connection to place. This terrain [can be changed](https://www.collectivepresencing.com/?inf_contact_key=8927539f64df7825bdf37d22692f72eacc0558ed5d4c28cbfab114022b1ec50d), by [trauma healing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDyj0EWscqk&t=32s) on a personal level, by systemic change toward a more compassionate society, and by transforming the basic narrative of separation: the separate self in a world of other, me separate from you, humanity separate from nature.

To be alone is a primal fear, and modern society has rendered us more and more alone. But the time of Reunion is here. **Every act of compassion, kindness, courage, or generosity heals us from the story of separation, because it assures both actor and witness that we are in this together.** I will conclude by invoking one more dimension of the relationship between humans and viruses. Viruses are integral to evolution, not just of humans but of all eukaryotes. Viruses can [transfer DNA](https://www.panspermia.org/virus.htm) from organism to organism, sometimes inserting it into the germline (where it becomes heritable). Known as horizontal gene transfer, this is a primary mechanism of evolution, allowing life to evolve together much faster than is possible through random mutation. As Lynn Margulis once put it, we are our viruses. And now let me venture into speculative territory. Perhaps the great diseases of civilization have quickened our biological and cultural evolution, bestowing key genetic information and offering both individual and collective initiation. Could the current pandemic be just that? Novel RNA codes are spreading from human to human, imbuing us with new genetic information; at the same time, we are receiving other, esoteric \"codes\" that ride the back of the biological ones, disrupting our narratives and systems in the same way that an illness disrupts bodily physiology. The phenomenon follows the template of initiation: separation from normality, followed by a dilemma, breakdown, or ordeal, followed (if it is to be complete) by reintegration and celebration. **Now the question arises: Initiation into what? What is the specific nature and purpose of this initiation? The popular name for the pandemic offers a clue: coronavirus. A corona is a crown. \"Novel coronavirus pandemic\" means \"a new coronation for all.\"** Already we can feel the power of who we might become. A true sovereign does not run in fear from life or from death. A true sovereign does not dominate and conquer (that is a shadow archetype, the Tyrant). The true sovereign serves the people, serves life, and respects the sovereignty of all people. **The coronation marks the emergence of the unconscious into consciousness, the crystallization of chaos into order, the transcendence of compulsion into choice. We become the rulers of that which had ruled us. **The New World Order that the conspiracy theorists fear is a shadow of the glorious possibility available to sovereign beings. No longer the vassals of fear, we can bring order to the kingdom and build an intentional society on the love already shining through", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronation.txt:22:066b28ac341e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10573, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronation", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "sovereignty of all people. **The coronation marks the emergence of the unconscious into consciousness, the crystallization of chaos into order, the transcendence of compulsion into choice.

Award-winning director and filmmaker produced a powerful documentary called *[Anecdotals](https://www.anecdotalsmovie.com/)*, that raises important questions and perspectives left out in the mainstream press about the COVID-19 vaccine.

I wish you all the very best in moving through these most intense and challenging times. And remember, we're all in this together. *Resilience Guide for Coronavirus Times* 1) Check-in so you don't check-out - be mindful of when you feel afraid and overwhelmed and how that might affect your ability to balance your thinking with different perspectives. 2) Question what you read - don't fall for the old maxim \"if it bleeds, it leads!\" 3) Follow the money. Who is profiting both financially and politically from this so-called pandemic? 4) Find the people in your life who can question WITH you what part of the narrative is being left out. 5) Practice self-care - any activity, hobby or way of eating that helps you remember your best self. We need to feel well in order to think well. 6) Physical distancing does *not*** **mean social distancing. Crisis brings out the humanity in us so that we are closer and more connected than ever. We are all in this together. 7) Recognize this is a powerful opportunity for learning and growth. And we always have a choice between fear and love. Let us acknowledge any fear that arises, yet then choose love.

Should we quarantine ourselves during flu season and also ban cars and hospitals? ** When the agenda being promoted is \"social distancing,\" with an underlying message \"fear those around you,\" there is very good reason to suspect something is off here. Do we really want to give in to all the fear being promoted worldwide? Caution is beautiful and useful, yet does fear really serve us?

Let's first get one fact clear: If you have ever had a cold or flu in your life, odds are that it was the result of a coronavirus infection. Yes, coronaviruses cause colds. But, we are being programmed with the belief that this particular cold virus is \"deadly.\" This fear has shut down concerts, conferences, and major public events all over the world. The fear has led to quarantines and closing down of international travel. It has even led to a major scarcity of toilet paper in Australia, where concerned citizens emptied the shelves of this commodity in anticipation that they will be walled up in their homes with this infection. First, how deadly is this version of the virus? **Yes, there have been corona-related deaths reported with the statistics suggesting that ~2% of the infected population dies**. What is misleading is the fear that everyone who carries this virus may die from their cold. This is simply untrue! **The health of almost all the victims of this coronavirus was already compromised before they were infected.** For example, the following information was provided by the news in regard to the 6 patients that died of the virus in the state of Washington last week (I added the bold print): **Washington State** Six people have died in Washington and health officials have identified 18 cases. Four of the cases in King County were linked to the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland. More than 50 residents and staff at the facility are being tested. The deaths announced Monday, according to health officials, included: -A male in his 70s, who lived at LifeCare. **He had underlying health conditions** and died Sunday. -A female resident of LifeCare in her 70s. She also **had underlying health conditions** and died Sunday. -A woman in her 80s, who **was already reported as in critical condition** at EvergreenHealth, died Sunday. -A Snohomish County resident at EvergreenHealth also died but details of that patient have not been given. Two previously reported deaths included a man in his 70s who **had underlying health conditions** and had been a resident of LifeCare. He died at EvergreenHealth on Feb. 29. The other was a man in his 50s **with underlying health conditions**. He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus. He died at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland. As emphasized in this report, the health of all those that died with the coronavirus was already compromised. **Healthy people get cold and flu", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-bogeyman.txt:1:8f9e1cc3e83b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10580, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-bogeyman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-bogeyman", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "man in his 70s who **had underlying health conditions** and had been a resident of LifeCare. He died at EvergreenHealth on Feb. 29. The other was a man in his 50s **with underlying health conditions**. He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus. He died at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland. As emphasized in this report, the health of all those that died with the coronavirus was already compromised. **Healthy people get cold and flu symptoms, while those already sick and near death's door may experience the \"Grim Reaper\" when infected by the virus.** As presented in *The Biology of Belief*, **stress is responsible for up to 90% of illness,** including heart disease, cancer and diabetes. When an individual is in stress, the release of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) shuts down the immune system to conserve the body's energy for running away from the perceived stressor, that proverbial \"saber-toothed tiger.\" Stress hormones are so effective at compromising the immune system, that physicians therapeutically provide recipients of organ transplants with stress hormones to prevent their immune system from rejecting the foreign implant. The conclusion is clear: The fear of the coronavirus is more deadly than the virus itself! The media ([perhaps in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/)) is compromising people's health using the fear card! This is the result of negative thinking (the nocebo effect) which is the complete opposite of the placebo effect manifest through positive thinking! If you make efforts to stay healthy, with good nutrition, exercise, taking vitamins and supplements, and more importantly, avoiding stress (e.g., the \"fear\" of the virus), even if you do get infected with the virus, you will likely only end up with a cold and/or slight fever. **If you are someone with a compromised immune system, it is supportive to surround yourself with loving family and friends, nature, and positive thoughts as well as any other nutrition and vitamins that you may already be taking for your health and wellbeing.** Following your intuition about what is best for you is key! The point here is that no matter who you are and what your state of health, you will only benefit from steering clear of the fear and supporting yourself in whatever way feels best to you. Please remember the truth of quantum physics, the most valid of all sciences on the planet: *Consciousness* is creating your life experiences! Are you being conscious of disease ... or of health? Wishing you all Health, Happiness and Harmony. With Love and Light, Bruce H.

Coronavirus: How Dangerous is it? Hint: Don't Trust the Media June 24, 2020 Dear friends, The coronavirus is spreading. Official [Johns Hopkins statistics](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) state that more than 1.5 million have died around the world and many more are dying every day. Caution is clearly warranted to protect our health and that of our loved ones. Yet consider this important data. [This CDC webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) reports U.S. annual statistics; \"Influenza has resulted in between 9 million - 45 million illnesses ... and between 12,000 - 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.\"[This CDC webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1213-flu-death-estimate.html) further states,** \"between 291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year.\"** Since it first began spreading in December last year, the coronavirus is said to have taken over 300,000 lives in the U.S.. That is certainly an alarming number, especially as it continues to grow. This is about five times the amount of deaths from the regular flu in a bad season in the U.S.. Worldwide the number of deaths is stated as over 1.5 million, three times the number of deaths from the regular flu. So is this virus as dangerous as the media would have us believe? Most people are well aware that the media makes money through publicizing tragedies and focusing on bad news. Fear sells. \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" **Fear-filled news makes money for corporate sponsors of the media, and the more fear generated, the greater the profits.** So when a new virus results in any significant number of deaths, it's only natural that [major media around the world hype it up with fear-mongering](https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0321/p09s01-coop.html). They continually spotlight the worst hit areas and bring public focus there while giving scant attention to how well some areas are doing. Look how much attention this virus has already drawn. How much has the media gotten you focused on this pandemic? Governments have also contributed to spreading fear. An [article in the U.K.'s*Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/14/swine-flu-elusive-as-wmd) spells out how government officials promulgated fear-filled pronouncements at the time of the 2009 swine flu. The U.K.'s chief medical officer stated on BBC that \"[65,000 could die](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/16/swine-flu-pandemic-warning-helpline)\" in Britain. Yet once the flu had run its course, the article continues, a total of only \"360 people have died under its influence, most with prior 'non-flu' conditions.\" That's less than 1/100th of what this official had predicted. **Another glaring example can be found in [this eye-opening 2009 CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/) that states, \"If you've been diagnosed 'probable' or 'presumed' 2009 H1N1 or 'swine flu' in recent months, you may be surprised to know this: odds are you didn't have H1N1 flu. In fact, you probably didn't have flu at all.\" The article goes on to show how the U.S. government's CDC blatantly manipulated numbers to induce fear. ****** With the current heightened level of fear, many who experience even mild symptoms of the flu are deeply concerned", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-dangerous.txt:0:21c5a55d4b1a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10583, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-dangerous.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-dangerous", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "2009 CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/) that states, \"If you've been diagnosed 'probable' or 'presumed' 2009 H1N1 or 'swine flu' in recent months, you may be surprised to know this: odds are you didn't have H1N1 flu. In fact, you probably didn't have flu at all.\" The article goes on to show how the U.S. government's CDC blatantly manipulated numbers to induce fear. ****** With the current heightened level of fear, many who experience even mild symptoms of the flu are deeply concerned that they might have the coronavirus. So they immediately go to the hospital only to find it jammed packed with others who have flu-like symptoms, when - even if they do have a virus - the vast majority of these people have only a common version of the flu. The overwhelm in the hospitals then gets spotlighted by the media, further exacerbating the level of fear, even though the hospital overwhelm has little relation to the relatively few numbers who actually have coronavirus. So panic reigns even when the real threat is much less than feared. Why did China lock down the entire city of Wuhan (population 11 million) and it's surrounding areas? Consider that with it's one-party system, China is one of the most controlled and surveilled countries in the world. Chinese citizens are not allowed to access facebook and thousands of other websites which might \"contaminate the thoughts\" of their people. **Could it be that China used this virus as a huge social experiment in crowd control? Was this used as an effort to see how much how much control China's communist party could generate through all the fear mongering? ** Consider also how the swine flu, avian flu, and SARS all drew widespread fear. The whole world was in deep fear that one or all of these diseases was going to kill many millions worldwide. These \"pandemics,\" the media warned, could even cause large parts of the world to be quarantined. Yet in the end for all of these, the number of deaths worldwide was far less than those for the normal flu. [https://www.WantToKnow.info/](https://www.WantToKnow.info/) The media and certain corporations and individuals profit handsomely from all this fear. Pharmaceutical stocks soar during disease outbreaks that get huge publicity. Gilead Sciences made money hand over fist with its sales of Tamiflu during the avian and swine flu scares. According to [this*Washington Post*article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060403034.html) on the swine flu, \"**The WHO's response caused widespread, unnecessary fear and prompted countries around the world to waste millions of dollars. [They] relied on advice from experts with ties to drug makers in developing the guidelines it used to encourage countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medications.\"** [This 2014 Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-hldg-novartis-search/stockpiles-of-roche-tamiflu-drug-are-waste-of-money-review-finds-idUSBREA390EJ20140410) states, \"Researchers who have fought for years to get full data on Roche's flu medicine Tamiflu said ... that governments who stockpile it are wasting *billions* of dollars on a drug whose effectiveness", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-dangerous.txt:1:02049eb8d8a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10584, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-dangerous.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-dangerous", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "caused widespread, unnecessary fear and prompted countries around the world to waste millions of dollars.

Even after the shelf-life of the drug was [extended from five to seven years](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLI244952), that huge stock of Tamiflu is now all expired, so the billions of dollars spent worldwide on Tamiflu during the avian and swine flu scares were wasted. Yet [Roche/Gilead](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/1999/10/roche-receives-fda-approval-of-tamiflu-first-pill-to-treat-the-most-common-strains-of-influenza-ab) happily pocketed most of that in profit that we as tax-payers paid for. To add another twist, [an article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/swine-flu/10756200/Tamiflu-drugs-given-for-swine-flu-were-waste-of-500m.html) in the U.K.'s respected newspaper, *The Independent* stated, \"The drug Tamiflu, given to tens of thousands of people during the swine flu pandemic, does nothing to halt the spread of influenza and the Government wasted nearly £500 million stockpiling it, a major study has found.\" The article continues, \"The review, authored by Oxford University, claims that Roche, the drug's Swiss manufacturer, gave a 'false impression' of its effectiveness and accuses the company of 'sloppy science.'\" And the [side effects nearly killed a number of children](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/11/swine-flu-tamiflu-andrew-castle). **Did you know that former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who was once chairman of the board at Gilead, personally made a [windfall of $5 million](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-donald-rumsfeld-makes-5-million-bird-avian-flu-drug-tamiflu-swine-flu) from sales of Tamiflu?** This was reported in the U.K.'s respected newspaper, *The Independent*, on March 12, 2006. Though there is certainly reason to be concerned, there are other reasons to suspect that the real risks from this coronavirus outbreak are being significantly exaggerated and people are being manipulated into a position of fear that actually benefits big Pharma and some politicians.

Created by the team behind what may be the most censored documentary ever - [*Plandemic*](https://banned.video/watch?id=5eb3062575314400169f3e6c) - this new documentary goes much further into the back story by following the money and providing an abundance of media news clips to back up the findings. *Plandemic*, first posted in early May and featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits, quickly went viral with countless millions of views and was banned on every major social media platform for questioning the official story about COVID-19. **This new, feature-length film has already been banned on facebook and may end up censored even more than *Plandemic*. What is it they don't want you to see?** *Indoctornation* is one of the most revelatory films on what is driving the vaccine agenda, the various roles of the WHO, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci and more. It beautifully connects the dots. Watch it free at the link below. [**https://plandemicseries.com**](https://plandemicseries.com) Should there be any problems with the above link, you can watch both *Indoctornation* and *Plandemic* and even download segments of *Indoctornation* for no charge on [this webpage](https://goldenageofgaia.com/2020/08/20/plandemic-indoctornation-world-premiere/). To watch an engaging video interview of Mikki Willis being interviewed by Brian Rose of [London Real](https://londonreal.tv/), see [this webpage](https://freedomplatform.tv/mikki-willis-director-of-plandemic-the-movie-follow-the-money-connect-the-dots-around-the-vaccine-agenda/). Willis discusses why he offered this documentary free of charge to the world and why he turned down offers of millions of dollars from those who want to support his work and has refused to commercialize it in any way. **Watch the interview and you will get a sense of the purity of heart of this courageous filmmaker.** **The story of how his life was changed by being part of the rescue effort on the day of 9/11 at the twin towers is particularly moving. ** Brian Rose explains in his discussion with Willis how this and other London Real interviews are being banned by almost every social media platform. Yet if you watch *Indoctornation*, you will be hard pressed to find what is being covered that is causing it be censored. There are some statements that can certainly be questioned, but is that worthy of the harsh censoring?

Meanwhile, the culture and information wars about COVID issues have generated ferocious argument, yet very little clarity about how we can engage with each other across the vast differences in the news we consume. The bedrock of democracy is the open flow of information and honest debate, which includes exploring what's left out of any single narrative or given piece of information. This is especially true for COVID issues. On one hand, the official COVID narrative promotes lockdown policies, vaccine mandates, and trusting our government agencies as the main source of information. On the other hand, a growing number of people are raising concerns about the devastating impacts of lockdown policies, the complex web of flawed studies and data integrity issues, deeper political agendas, lack of transparency, blatant censorship, and untold stories of vaccine injuries that are much more common than we might think. Now that some time has passed, many COVID-related concerns once discredited are no longer considered a \"conspiracy theory.\" For example, are COVID vaccine injuries rare? The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a [voluntary government reporting system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) that [only captures a portion of the actual injuries](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-electronic-support-public-healthvaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system). **Vaccine adverse event numbers are [made publically available](https://openvaers.com/), and currently show 1,630,913 COVID vaccine injury reports, 37,231 COVID Vaccine Reported Deaths, and 214,906 COVID Vaccine Reported Hospitalizations.** If accepting the official COVID story was indeed the most effective way to end the pandemic, a democratic and pro-science society would still seek to understand alternative perspectives pointing to harm and injustice. Many of these harms are only beginning to come to light.

Interestingly enough, the study required an ethical exemption by the Yale Institutional Review Board in order to run these experiments on humans, given that the whole experiment was about convincing people to take a vaccine that didn't even yet exist. **However, the results of the Yale study reveal how the most effective strategies to get people vaccinated wasn't a logical or scientific approach. It was a psychosocial, emotional one.** If vaccination was indeed the most effective way to end the pandemic, a democratic society would still seek to understand the questions and concerns people have about the vaccine first, as opposed to manipulating behaviors and emotional responses through sophisticated, persuasive messaging tactics that achieve certain political policy aims.

Who is profiting both financially and politically from this so-called pandemic? 4) Find the people in your life who can question WITH you what part of the narrative is being left out. 5) Practice self-care - any activity, hobby or way of eating that helps you remember your best self. We need to feel well in order to think well. 6) Physical distancing does *not* mean social distancing. Crisis brings out the humanity in us so that we are closer and more connected than ever. We are all in this together. 7) Recognize this is a powerful opportunity for learning and growth. And we always have a choice between fear and love.

We're learning how powerful and efficient something incredibly tiny can be when it resonates with a latent field. This tiny thing, in this case, is a virus. The latent field is fear - an immense, collective fear of the future: an ingredient and counterpart of turbo-capitalism on the edge of global collapse.** Things are happening today that no one else has been able to achieve - not the climate strikes or environmental actions of recent years, nor the UN in all its years of existence, nor all the efforts, threats, appeals, movements and scientists, nor the Pope or other authorities. Now we're seeing determined, rigorous action across all continents. Industry, tourism, education, sports... Large areas of public life in many countries of the world have been locked down. Humanity is on pause. And suddenly, the skies over China and northern Italy are clearing up again - air pollution is decreasing dramatically - people stay at home and finally have time for themselves, to reflect and contemplate, think about what is essential, be with their children and the people close to them. In Italy, they're singing to each other from windows and balconies. Who or what could cause this? Who has so much power? We've heard conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, but we deliberately don't deal with them here. If the new coronavirus was actually passed to humans from wildlife, we could see it as a measure of nature to help humanity to finally change our lives. **Regardless of whether the virus is man-made or natural, it shows us how fragile and vulnerable our globalized systems are and that humanity", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-learning-from.txt:0:7ea9b2f8b1d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10602, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-learning-from.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-learning-from", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Who or what could cause this?

If the new coronavirus was actually passed to humans from wildlife, we could see it as a measure of nature to help humanity to finally change our lives. **Regardless of whether the virus is man-made or natural, it shows us how fragile and vulnerable our globalized systems are and that humanity is capable of fundamentally changing its collective behavior, literally from one day to the next.** Let's take this forced pause to imagine how a healing transformation in our societies could come about! How will we supply ourselves? Who are the ones around us that we can cooperate with? What will we do when the global systems actually collapse? Perhaps later we will look back on the corona crisis as a great collective exercise in which we began to develop the decentralized community systems with which we could respond to the ecological and social crises. Fear and panic aren't good advisors. The qualities we need most at this time of radical change are trust, mutual support, responsibility for the whole, flexibility and openness in the face of the unpredictable. Something remains startling: the incredible power of the virus and its ability to show humanity that we're much more intimately connected than we thought. When a substance in our airways, which is only transmitted through direct contact, spreads around the world within a few weeks, we can say: We are indeed *one* breath. And that is good news. Why shouldn't we also be able to use this intimate unity of life on Earth to start a positive movement? What is possible through fear must also be possible through trust. From mouth to mouth, something quite different than a virus could then be shared. **Above all, there is a message of hope and certainty for the future: that we're part of a large community of people, animals, nature and divine beings who form a unified whole, who support, help, perceive, complement and love each other. The Earth and humanity can be healed, even at this stage, and in a short time, if we humans realize and accept our real task. Love and unity are the basic substance in the alliance of all living beings - that is the good news.** What do we need to make this good news spread just as quickly as the virus does now? We need to resonate with another collective field within us, one that is much deeper than fear - a field that is still hidden at the moment. It's the collective field of trust, the matrix of life, which [Dieter Duhm](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Matrix-Dieter-Duhm/dp/3927266167) refers to as the \"sacred matrix.\" For, despite all the suffering, all the horrors of the past and all the threats, life is still oriented", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-learning-from.txt:1:b4734ec002b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10603, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-learning-from.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-learning-from", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "need to make this good news spread just as quickly as the virus does now?

Whether it is germs, terrorists, or the next door neighbour, we seek to eliminate anything that doesn't agree with us rather than trying to maintain a healthy balance between desired and undesirable circumstances.\"** ~~ Derek Henry Dear friends, I cut my foot on a run today. I enjoy a 1 1/2 mile run in the hills barefoot almost every day. I've been running barefoot my whole life, as I know it's healthy for me to be in direct contact with the soil. It's a form of natural acupressure on the feet. And once every great while it's a form of natural acupuncture, as happened today. At the beginning of my run this afternoon, I came down on a small chip of wood with a very sharp point. Ouch!!! I checked the sole of my foot and it was bleeding. If it had been bleeding a lot (which thankfully has never happened), I would have carefully walked home and taken care of it. **As it only bled a couple drops, I decided to continue my run and trust that my body could heal the small cut by itself.** I was not worried that dirt on the cut would cause problems, as I've gotten small cuts like this dozens of times over the years and it has never gotten infected when I continue running. I have no doubt this helps to strengthen my immune system. And to be clear, I don't recommend this to others unless you've already had a lot of experience in challenging your body this way. I share this story because it relates beautifully to the purpose of this message and to the wonderful, thought-provoking essay I'd like to share below. From the beginning, something in my gut didn't feel right about the response to the growing number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus. The message almost always felt like it was packaged in an excessive level of fear. The underlying message paraded in the media thundered like an incessant drumbeat: Be afraid. The virus is going to kill millions. It might kill you and your loved ones, too. Be afraid of getting close to others. Stay home to be safe. **And beneath that sentiment was the message that we can't trust our own bodies when faced with something like this.** We must place our trust in the experts and government health officials to do the right thing in the face of this huge threat.

And what a magical coincidence to find it on the same day as I cut my foot. The article challenges us to consider the way we view life and disease on a very fundamental level. So much wisdom here. And it was written long before this age of the coronavirus. I invite you to read these thought-provoking words and see how they touch you. Here's the essay: **Is It The Germ Or The Terrain That Determines Our Health? By Derek Henry ** In the Western world, we are desperately obsessed with killing things off that we feel can threaten our livelihood. Whether it is germs, terrorists, or the next door neighbour, we seek to eliminate anything that doesn't agree with us rather than trying to maintain a healthy balance between desired and undesirable circumstances. **When it comes to our health, the Western world has largely adopted the germ theory, meaning we need to identify and destroy anything we deem as a foreign invader, as it is directly responsible for causing disease. However, there is another theory called the terrain theory, which believes that it is not the \"germ\" that determines disease, but rather, the state of our internal health and its ability to maintain homeostasis in the face of unfriendly organisms.** Let's look into each theory a bit further. **Germ Theory** The germ - or microbial - theory of disease was popularized by [Louis Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur) (1822 - 1895), the inventor of pasteurization. **This theory states that there are external germs which invade the body and are the direct cause of a variety of separate, definable diseases. If you truly want to get well, you need to kill whatever germ made you sick, **and do whatever possible to make sure that you never allow a microbe to enter your body in the first place. With this theory comes Western medicine and its tools and technology that treats the symptoms of an unfriendly microbe rooting itself in the internal environment, through things such as drugs, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Taking it a step further, in order to try and avoid an infection in the first place, various vaccines have been introduced to attempt to keep the disease from invading our body in the first place. The germ theory was partly shaped around Pasteur's idea that the human body is sterile, meaning it is a blank slate devoid of any germs. With this notion in mind we could conclude that we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental.txt:1:d8b7271c244b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10607, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "through things such as drugs, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Taking it a step further, in order to try and avoid an infection in the first place, various vaccines have been introduced to attempt to keep the disease from invading our body in the first place. The germ theory was partly shaped around Pasteur's idea that the human body is sterile, meaning it is a blank slate devoid of any germs. With this notion in mind we could conclude that we have to combat germs in every way possible, and that preventative measures through things like nutrition are basically useless. So, if you closely follow the germ theory, you need to be vigilant against various types of infections through prevention (like vaccinations), and destruction (antibiotics, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) of any external microbe that attempts to or succeeds in getting inside our body. **Terrain Theory** The terrain theory was initiated by [Claude Bernard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard) (1813 - 1878), and later built upon by [Antoine Bechamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Béchamp) (1816-1908). They believed that the \"terrain\" or \"internal environment\" determined our state of health. When the body is functioning in homeostasis and immunity and detoxification are operating well, they claimed there was a healthy terrain which could handle various pathogenic microorganisms that are inevitably thrown its way. In essence, they believed the quality of the terrain and the elements it faced determined an individual's susceptibility to disease. **Bernard, Bechamp, and their successors, believed that disease occurs to a large extent as a result of changes that take place when metabolic processes become imbalanced. Germs then become symptoms that stimulate the occurrence of more symptoms, which eventually culminate into disease.** A weak terrain is naturally more vulnerable to external threats, so it needs to be built up through nutrition, detoxification, and by maintaining a proper pH or acid/alkaline balance. For this and other reasons Bechamp argued vehemently against vaccines, asserting that \"the most serious disorders may be provoked by the injection of living organisms into the blood.\" [Many] researchers have agreed with him. **So, if you closely follow the terrain theory, you may make yourself aware of various external microbes that could be harmful to our health and the means to a gentle, non-toxic removal of them, but your focus is on building and maintaining the integrity of your inner terrain, so that any external microbe that manages to enter your body does not morph into anything with serious implications to your health.** This means nutrition, detoxification, and mindset are key factors you consider important in disease prevention and elimination. So when you are considering your health plan, strongly consider the results we are seeing in a germ theory dominated health care system. Then decide whether you want to take that road, or follow those who predominantly follow the terrain theory. **Final notes from Fred:** Just to be clear, I'm not trying to convince anyone of the terrain theory, which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental.txt:2:053fb9619355", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10608, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-questions-fundamental", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "to your health.** This means nutrition, detoxification, and mindset are key factors you consider important in disease prevention and elimination. So when you are considering your health plan, strongly consider the results we are seeing in a germ theory dominated health care system. Then decide whether you want to take that road, or follow those who predominantly follow the terrain theory. **Final notes from Fred:** Just to be clear, I'm not trying to convince anyone of the terrain theory, which I had never heard of before. I just offer this as food for thought and a different way of looking at health and disease that makes a lot of sense to me. Terrain theory sounds a lot like modern-day holistic medicine. And what may be best is to implement the best of both models. [Derek Henry](https://healingthebody.ca/derek-henry-founder-of-healing-the-body/), the author of this article, used nutrition, natural remedies, and a holistic lifestyle to naturally unravel 13 chronic disease conditions that conventional or alternative medical professionals couldn't help him resolve. As a result, he is now happier and healthier than he has ever been. I copied his article from [this webpage](https://healingthebody.ca/is-it-the-germ-or-the-terrain-that-determines-our-health/) of his website. The coronavirus has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. It is very serious. Yet you've probably noticed that nearly 90% of those who have died had underlying health issues, as reported in [this MSN article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/nearly-90percent-of-people-hospitalized-for-covid-19-have-underlying-conditions-says-cdc/ar-BB12pf0p). Clearly, we need to protect these people with weakened immune systems. Yet we are also seeing that a large percentage of the people who get the virus show no symptoms at all - asymptomatic. **What if instead of allowing fear and separation to dominate these intense times, we use this crisis as an opportunity to take a closer look at the germ theory and open to the possibility that some amount of germs and viruses can be good for us as long as we keep our bodies in a healthy homeostasis?** What if while protecting those with compromised immune systems, we spotlight the importance of cultivating and maintaining a healthy immune system by not overly avoiding germs and viruses, as I did by allowing dirt into the wound on my run today? I invite you to consider these matters seriously to see if there is any shift you might make to build a healthier body that lives in greater harmony with the surrounding environment. I wish you all the very best in moving through these most intense and challenging times. And remember, we're all in this together.

May you find ever greater health and happiness. *Resilience Guide for Coronavirus Times* 1) Check-in so you don't check-out - be mindful of when you feel afraid and overwhelmed and how that might affect your ability to balance your thinking with different perspectives. 2) Question what you read - don't fall for the old maxim \"if it bleeds, it leads!\" 3) Follow the money. Who is profiting both financially and politically from this so-called pandemic? 4) Find the people in your life who can question WITH you what part of the narrative is being left out. 5) Practice self-care - any activity, hobby or way of eating that helps you remember your best self. We need to feel well in order to think well. 6) Physical distancing does *not*** **mean social distancing. Crisis brings out the humanity in us so that we are closer and more connected than ever. We are all in this together. 7) Recognize this is a powerful opportunity for learning and growth. And we always have a choice between fear and love. Let us acknowledge any fear that arises, yet then choose love.

Yet what is the cost? Is the damage from these policies greater than the damage from the virus itself?** What would happen if governments continued these two policies indefinitely? If social distancing and lockdown policies were implemented permanently, many thousands of lives could be saved worldwide every year from decreased deaths due to the seasonal flu and other contagious diseases. **Yet is this really how we want to live our lives?** The vast majority of people would not likely be comfortable with making these policies permanent, even if they would save thousands of lives worldwide. The cost to humanity socially and spiritually would significantly outweigh the cost of those lives. Society as we know it would be drastically different and great freedoms would be lost. Not to mention the many deaths that would result from these policies due to suicide, domestic violence, poverty, and how many people's jobs and careers would be ruined or lost. This raises an important and profound question in these most challenging times. When is it beneficial to implement these policies? Are the economic and social damage caused by the lockdown greater than the damage caused by the virus itself? **How do we weigh the balance between the number of lives saved as a result of these policies and the number of deaths actually caused by the policies in addition to the suffering caused socially, economically, and spiritually?** A [*New York Times*article](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/09/us/09reuters-health-coronavirus-poverty.html) titled \"Coronavirus Crisis Could Plunge Half a Billion People Into Poverty\" states that according to an Oxfam report, \"Estimates show that, regardless of the scenario, global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990. This could throw some countries back to poverty levels last seen some three decades ago.\" David Beasley, the winner of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize and executive director of the World Food Program, [has stated](https://abcnews.go.com/International/literally-horrific-world-food-programme-nobel-peace-prize/story?id=73526556), \"At the beginning of this year [2020], 135 million people already faced starvation. Now, 270 million people are on the brink of starvation.\" If he is anywhere near accurate, this means well over 100 million people have been pushed to the brink of starvation not by the virus, but by the lockdown measures. Why are so many focused on deaths from the coronavirus and so few talking about the deaths from starvation, suicide, domestic violence, and much more due to lockdown policies that have already left over 100 million with not enough food to eat? These factors are being weighed seriously by the few countries not implementing shelter in place and lockdown policies. This despite intense pressure from the major media and governments worldwide. Notable examples are Sweden, the Netherlands, and Japan. The risk here is great. **Not implementing a lockdown will most", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-questions-statistics.txt:0:aa78642c6504", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10612, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-questions-statistics.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-questions-statistics", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "and so few talking about the deaths from starvation, suicide, domestic violence, and much more due to lockdown policies that have already left over 100 million with not enough food to eat?

Notable examples are Sweden, the Netherlands, and Japan. The risk here is great. **Not implementing a lockdown will most certainly result in more deaths. The question is: How many more deaths will there be? Will the number of excess virus deaths be outweighed by the number of deaths caused by the lockdown in the long run?** Is it worth it in the long term if say 25% more people die from the virus, but millions of businesses go bankrupt and millions die from poverty, suicide, and more? This certainly seems possible. I've been following three countries which have not instituted lockdowns to see how they compare with other countries which have. The countries are Sweden, Japan, and the Netherlands. **Sweden's top epidemiologist believes lockdown do more harm than good.** [This CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/europe/sweden-lockdown-turmp-intl/index.html) relates how \"life goes on as usual\" there, despite a relative high per capita rate of infection. Here's a quote from the article: Restaurants and bars are open in the Nordic country, playgrounds and schools too, and the government is relying on voluntary action to stem the spread of Covid-19. The Swedish government is confident its policy can work. Sweden's actions are about encouraging and recommending, not compulsion. Much of Sweden's focus has been to protect the elderly. Anyone aged 70 or older has been told to stay at home and limit their social contact as much as possible. Note the that media, which seems intent on painting Sweden in a negative light, regularly compares this Nordic country to its immediate neighbors Finland and Norway, who are doing much better than most countries. Yet unlike these two, **Sweden was hit hard in the beginning before any countries (other than China) locked down. It is much more reasonable to compare Sweden to Italy, Spain, and Belgium, which were also hit hard in the beginning. Sweden has less deaths per million than all of these, yet the media consistently fails to mention this. ** Then there is Japan. According to [this*Washington Post*article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/10/japans-coronavirus-response-is-too-little-too-late/): Tokyo's coronavirus \"state of emergency\" is as surreal as they come. Though the streets are noticeably quieter than normal, subways and buses are still jammed with commuters. Stock trading goes on as normal. Many bars, restaurants and cafes are abuzz. So are barbershops, beauty salons and home improvement centers. And this [Dec. 12, 2020 article](The Japanese authorities understood covid-19 better than most) in *The Economist* states: Japan has suffered just 18 deaths per million people ... by far the lowest in the G7, a club of big,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-questions-statistics.txt:1:38e8e23737fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10613, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-questions-statistics.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-questions-statistics", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "surreal as they come.

(Germany comes in second, at 239.) Most strikingly, Japan has achieved this success without strict lockdowns or mass testing-the main weapons in the battle against covid-19 elsewhere. The Netherlands is calling their policy an \"intelligent lockdown\" in which, according to [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeroenkraaijenbrink/2020/04/14/the-dutch-answer-to-covid-19-the-15-meter-economy/), \"only the most important sources that may spread the coronavirus are closed.\" In [my extensive research](https://www.wanttoknow.info/), I've been following the coronavirus number of deaths closely both globally and in eight countries, including these three. The number of cases reported is not very reliable, since testing in the U.S. and elsewhere has been highly inconsistent from place to place. The numbers of hospitalizations and deaths are a much more accurate measure of how the disease is progressing. As data comparing the number of hospitalizations per country is very difficult to find, I've been following the number of deaths very closely in these countries. **Many would expect these three countries with their more lax policies to experience a far greater increase in fatalities than most, if not all other countries. Yet this has not been the case. ** For a comparison, here's [an informative chart](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/) showing the rank of countries worldwide by deaths per million population from the coronavirus. As of July 2022, the U.S. is #15, the U.K. is ranked #26, Sweden is ranked #42, Netherlands is #66, while Japan is #97 out of 154 countries. **If lockdowns and mandatory social distancing made a big difference, we would expect these three countries to be at or at least near the top of the list of deaths per million.** They were willing to take the risk of more deaths, feeling that the social, economic, and emotional cost of these policies would be too great. And yet surprisingly, their death rates have been lower than many other key countries implementing these policies. Why isn't this being talked about at all in the media? ([Possible answer here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mediacorruption)) And what does this suggest about the effectiveness of the lockdowns? **With the great economic loss, many millions losing their jobs, and the rate of poverty, suicide and domestic violence rising all as a result of lockdown and social distancing policies, how wise is it to lock things down so tightly when the few countries which aren't doing this are showing lower death rates than many of the rest?

There are many important factors to consider here in addition to the numbers of people dying and being hospitalized by the virus. How much do we [give up our freedoms](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus-what-if) in the name of safety and security? How will the fear of germs and the fear of being close to others play out once the pandemic fades? And then there are the countless small and medium-sized businesses that have gone or will go bankrupt, with a high likelihood that - as in previous recessions - many will eventually be bought out by the wealthy elite for pennies on the dollar. And what about our children. Do we really want them to grow up afraid to hug and touch and play with each other? Do we want them to live in fear of disease and death. Children need in person socialization to grow into healthy adults. Why isn't anyone talking about this? **Many thousands of lives have been saved, yet how much emotional damage are the lockdowns causing to our children. And how many more jobs and lives will be damaged and lost in the long run as a result of these policies that infringe on our civil liberties? ** May calmer heads prevail as we face these huge challenges. And may we remember that we're all in this together, even when we may disagree sharply about how to go about doing this.

We need to feel well in order to think well. 6) Physical distancing does *not*** **mean social distancing. Crisis brings out the humanity in us so that we are closer and more connected than ever. We are all in this together. 7) Recognize that [crisis can be a powerful opportunity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shift-mind/201110/turning-crisis-opportunity) for learning and growth. And we always have [a choice between fear and love](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/love-fear). Let us acknowledge any fear that arises, yet then choose love.

Interestingly enough, **the study required an ethical exemption by the Yale Institutional Review Board in order to run these experiments on humans, given that *the whole experiment was about convincing people to take a vaccine that didn't even yet exist*.** Here were the public health message interventions used: Other: Baseline message 3/15 of the sample will be assigned to a control group with a message about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. Other: Personal freedom message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, **which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting people's personal freedom** and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its personal freedom. Other: Economic freedom message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, **which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting people's economic freedom** and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its economic freedom. Other: Self-interest message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, **which is a message that COVID-19 presents a real danger to one's health,** even if one is young and healthy. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to prevent oneself from getting sick. Other: Community interest message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about the dangers of COVID-19 to the health of loved ones. **The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the lower the risk that one's loved ones will get sick. **Society must work together and all get vaccinated. Other: Economic benefit message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this group, which is a message about how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the economy and **the only way to strengthen the economy is to work together to get enough people vaccinated.** Other: Guilt message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message. The message is about the danger that COVID-19 presents to the health of one's family and community. The best way to protect them is by getting vaccinated and society must work together to get enough people vaccinated. **Then it asks the participant to imagine the guilt they will feel if they don't get vaccinated and spread the disease.** Other: Embarrassment message 1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message.

Secondary desired outcomes included measuring the increase of: 1. vaccine confidence 2. willingness to persuade others to take the vaccine 3. the fear people have towards those who have not been vaccinated 4. the social judgment of those who do not vaccinate For people who believe that widespread vaccination is the most effective measure for mitigating the effects of COVID, this study is likely to be seen as part of a vital effort to deal with a deadly pandemic. If we're later told that this vaccine is safe and would save millions of lives a year, who wouldn't want to be vaccinated? Yet now, with much of the population being vaccinated, many are calling for a more nuanced discussion on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines.

Unfortunately, a great effort has been put in to censoring or discrediting any perspective that strays from the official narrative, even if some of these perspectives provide a deeper understanding of this complex public health issue. If vaccination was indeed the most effective way to end the pandemic, **a democratic society would still seek to understand the questions and concerns people have about the vaccine first, as opposed to manipulating behaviors and emotional responses through sophisticated, persuasive messaging tactics that achieve certain political policy aims.** For example, there are real concerns when it comes to the [growing number](https://react19.org/stories/) of injuries and deaths associated with the vaccine, questions about [COVID death counts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/13/covid-pandemic-deaths-hospitalizations-overcounting/) and [data integrity](https://www.projectcensored.org/covid-19-vaccine-safety-and-data-integrity-concerns/) with the vaccine trials, the [regulatory capture](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/how-the-cdc-abandoned-science) of our government agencies, and unprecedented levels of censorship that create the *impression* of a consensus that may not reflect the full reality. Now that some time has passed, we know that vaccination [does not prevent transmission](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/vaccines-never-prevented-transmission-covid-alex-gutentag) despite public health officials [falsely leading us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQNmD3RmJ8o) to believe this.

The bedrock of democracy is the open flow of debate and information, which includes the process of exploring what's left out of any single narrative or given piece of information. **Being truly informed arises from exploring multiple perspectives, and not buying into the either/or, black/white thinking that simplifies societal issues and reality itself.** While COVID dissent was labeled as an \"attack on science,\" it can also be perceived as an appropriate use of the precautionary principle. Nancy Myers from the Science and Environmental Health Network [defines](https://www.sehn.org/sehn/2020/1/16/debating-the-precautionary-principle) the precautionary principle as one that is \"based on the assumption that people have the right to know as much as possible about risks they are taking on, in exchange for what benefits, and to make choices accordingly.\" The Precautionary Principle reflects the reality of working with and within complex systems. We live in a fast-moving world where regulation does not always keep up with innovation ... Science doesn't necessarily move fast enough to protect us from potential risks, especially ones that shift harm elsewhere or take a long time to show up. **The Precautionary Principle forces us to ask a lot of difficult questions about the nature of risk, uncertainty, probability, the role of government, and ethics.** - [*The Precautionary Principle: Better Safe than Sorry?*](https://fs.blog/precautionary-principle-2/) **However, the results of the Yale study reveal how the most effective strategies to get people vaccinated wasn't a logical or scientific approach.

Gregory A. Huber, the Forst Family Professor of Political Science in Yale's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a co-author of the study [reported](https://news.yale.edu/2021/11/03/appeals-community-spirit-shame-most-likely-shift-vaccine-attitudes) that **\"emotional appeals, such as evoking embarrassment, motivate people to reach out to others. That effect is likely very important to increasing the vaccination rate.\"** **Psychological tactics to change public behavior have concerning implications regardless of where you stand in this polarized vaccine information war fueled by the media.** The [unethical use of \"nudge\" tactics](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/01/28/grossly-unethical-downing-street-nudge-unit-accused-scaring/) to inflate fear among the public prompted 40 psychologists in the UK to write a [letter](https://www.coronababble.com/post/the-dubious-ethics-of-nudging-we-urgently-need-an-independent-inquiry) to the Parliament's Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, saying it was \"highly questionable whether a civilised society should knowingly increase the emotional discomfort of its citizens as a means of gaining their compliance.\" The letter added: *Government scientists deploying fear, shame and scapegoating to change minds is an ethically dubious practice that in some respects resembles the tactics used by totalitarian regimes such as China, where the state inflicts pain on a subset of its population in an attempt to eliminate beliefs and behaviour they perceive to be deviant.* Stella Morabito, former CIA analyst who specialized in Soviet propaganda and disinformation methods, explains the power of gaining compliance through emotional manipulation tactics in her new book, *The Weaponization of Loneliness: How Tyrants Stoke Our Fear of Isolation to Silence, Divide, and Conquer*. Here's a striking passage from her book: *Even if the great majority of a population is not on board with an authoritarian agenda, a huge part of the agenda can be achieved through the power of mobs. Propagandized agendas can advance quickly when there's a good dose of agitation along with well-orchestrated media support for them. **This all serves to ignite the social contagion of high emotion.*** She explores the history of how powerful dictators, elite figures, and corporations exploit human nature, using the fear of loneliness and ostracization to gain and maintain authority, and marginalize dissent. *Revolutionary elites who push utopias are always a small minority.

Propagandized agendas can advance quickly when there's a good dose of agitation along with well-orchestrated media support for them. **This all serves to ignite the social contagion of high emotion.*** She explores the history of how powerful dictators, elite figures, and corporations exploit human nature, using the fear of loneliness and ostracization to gain and maintain authority, and marginalize dissent. *Revolutionary elites who push utopias are always a small minority. In order to get all of society on board, they must enlist mobs to promote the illusion of compliance with their visions. Mobs enforce the narrative, often through violence. They help censor any competing views through intimidation and various forms of book burning. The common denominator of such revolutions past, present, and future is the weaponization of loneliness. All its features pit people against one another. All were at work in various ways in past revolutions of modern history. **And all result in our further atomization, our further separation from one another. ** The most critical features are the forces of identity politics, political correctness, and mobs. Identity politics is clearly meant to divide us into hostile groups, such as oppressor and victim, based on race or sex or any other demographic grouping. Political correctness induces us to self-censor, which means we drive ourselves into further isolation by limiting our exchanges with others to avoid the risk of social rejection. Mobs then serve as agitation forces that push propaganda into action. **They intimidate others into silence and compliance and finally can cause any agenda-no matter how fringy-to become policy. ** Another way to think about the machinery is as a combustion engine that can't operate without ignited fuel. T**he fuel is our conformity impulse, and the spark is our fear. Without them, the machinery of loneliness simply can't operate. **So if we cannot shake off our conformity impulse and fear of isolation, we will remain self-silenced, isolated, and obedient to the mob. We will end up lonelier, more exhausted, and conditioned to repeat the cycle.* As French political and social scientist Jacques Ellul noted, \"Propaganda ends where simple dialogue begins.\" **CIA analyst Morabito asserted that we must rebuild civic society by developing parallel institutions that rewrite the stories of the underlying power structures corrupting our society. **This starts with understanding the inner workings of identity politics, how political correctness shuts us up, and how mobs operate. Along with this, she suggests we reach insights into other related topics, such as \"cult methods, gaslighting, censorship, mass movements, behavior modification or 'nudge' units in governments, coercive thought reform, and more.\" The [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) reveal how strongly a person's opinions are affected by people around them, even when it means denying their own intuition and sense of things. Yet interestingly enough, Morabito points out that \"partnering with a subject enormously reduced conformity in giving a false answer.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus-shaping-groupthink-and-conformity.txt:4:6286b7a95d33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10622, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus-shaping-groupthink-and-conformity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus-shaping-groupthink-and-conformity", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "operate.

Yet interestingly enough, Morabito points out that \"partnering with a subject enormously reduced conformity in giving a false answer. **Partnering even by just one person punctures the illusion that everyone has the same opinion.** And it has an effect on bystanders, even if they don't immediately chime in.\" We've all experienced groupthink or some form of social rejection. Morabito ends her book emphasizing the power of foregrounding personal stories and human exchanges to strengthen our resistance to conformity and social pressures. We can't make sense of our times alone. Hardwired for connection, we might find that open inquiry together about crucial societal issues is a necessity for democracy and collective survival.

In an attempt to fight the epidemic, the government has given its surveillance state apparatus - which boasts the most expansive and sophisticated surveillance system in the world - free rein. [Thermal scanners using artificial intelligence (AI) have been installed at train stations in major cities to assess body temperatures](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/china-ai-big-data-combat-coronavirus-outbreak-200301063901951.html) and identify anyone with a fever. [Facial recognition cameras and cell phone carriers track people's movements constantly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-surveillance/coronavirus-brings-chinas-surveillance-state-out-of-the-shadows-idUSKBN2011HO), reporting in real time to data centers that can be accessed by government agents and employers alike. And [coded color alerts (red, yellow and green) sort people into health categories](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html) that correspond to the amount of freedom of movement they're allowed: \"Green code, travel freely. Red or yellow, report immediately.\" Mind you, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese surveillance state had already been hard at work tracking its citizens through the use of some 200 million security cameras installed nationwide. Equipped with facial recognition technology, the cameras allow authorities to track so-called criminal acts, such as jaywalking, which factor into a person's social credit score. **Social media credit scores assigned to Chinese individuals and businesses categorize them on whether or not they are \"good\" citizens.** A real-name system - [which requires people to use government-issued ID cards to buy mobile sims, obtain social media accounts, take a train, board a plane, or even buy groceries](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/china-ai-big-data-combat-coronavirus-outbreak-200301063901951.html) - coupled with social media credit scores ensures that **those blacklisted as \"unworthy\" are [banned from accessing financial markets, buying real estate or travelling by air or train](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2186606/chinas-social-credit-system-shows-its-teeth-banning-millions). **Among the activities that can get you labeled unworthy are taking reserved seats on trains or causing trouble in hospitals. That same social credit score technology used to identify, track and segregate citizens is now one of China's chief weapons in its fight to contain the coronavirus from spreading. However, it is far from infallible and a prime example of the difficulties involved in navigating an autonomous system where disembodied AI systems call the shots. For instance, one woman, who has no symptoms of the virus but was assigned a red code based on a visit to her hometown, has been [blocked from returning to her home and job until her color code changes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html).

She has been stuck in this state of limbo for weeks with no means of challenging the color code or knowing exactly why she's been assigned a red code. **Fighting the coronavirus epidemic has given China the perfect excuse for unleashing the full force of its surveillance and data collection powers. The problem, as Eamon Barrett acknowledges in *Fortune *magazine, is what happens after: \"[Once the outbreak is controlled, it's unclear whether the government will retract its new powers](https://fortune.com/2020/03/01/coronavirus-china-surveillance-tracking/).\"** The lesson for the ages: once *any* government is allowed to expand its powers, it's almost impossible to pull back. Meanwhile, here in the U.S., the government thus far has limited its coronavirus preparations to missives advising the public to stay calm, wash their hands, and cover their mouths when they cough and sneeze. Don't go underestimating the government's ability to lock the nation down if the coronavirus turns into a pandemic, however. After all, the government has been [planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/13/pentagon-video-warns-of-unavoidable-dystopian-future-for-worlds-biggest-cities/). The building blocks are already in place for such an eventuality: the surveillance networks, fusion centers and government contractors that already share information in real time; the government's massive biometric databases that can identify individuals based on genetic and biological markers; the militarized police, working in conjunction with federal agencies, ready and able to coordinate with the federal government when it's time to round up the targeted individuals; **the courts that will sanction the government's methods, no matter how unlawful, as long as it's done in the name of national security; and the detention facilities, whether private prisons or FEMA internment camps, that have been built and are waiting to be filled.** Now all of this may sound far-fetched to you *now*, but we've already arrived at the dystopian futures prophesied by George Orwell's *1984*, Aldous Huxley's *Brave New *World, and Philip K. Dick's *Minority Report*. It won't take much more to push us over the edge into Neill Blomkamp's *Elysium*, in which the majority of humanity is relegated to an overpopulated, diseased, warring planet where the government employs technologies such as drones, tasers and biometric scanners to track, target and control the populace.

In other words, you're most likely already flagged in a government database somewhere. The government has the know-how. **Indeed, for years now, the FBI and Justice Department have conspired to acquire near-limitless power and control over biometric information collected on law-abiding individuals, millions of whom have never been accused of a crime**. Going far beyond the scope of those with criminal backgrounds, the FBI's Next Generation Identification database (NGID), a billion dollar boondoggle that is aimed at dramatically expanding the government's ID database from a fingerprint system to a vast data storehouse of iris scans, photos searchable with face recognition technology, palm prints, and measures of gait and voice recordings alongside records of fingerprints, scars, and tattoos. Launched in 2008, the NGID is a massive biometric database that contains more than 100 million fingerprints and 45 million facial photos gathered from a variety of sources ranging from criminal suspects and convicts to daycare workers and visa applicants, including millions of people who have never committed or even been accused of a crime. In other words, innocent American citizens are now automatically placed in a suspect database. For a long time, the government was required to at least observe some basic restrictions on when, where and how it could access someone's biometrics and DNA and use it against them.

The nation's courts are also doing their part to \"build\" the database, requiring biometric information as a precursor to more lenient sentences. And of course Corporate America (including Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) has made it so easy to use one's biometrics to access everything from bank accounts to cell phones. We've made it so easy for the government to target, identify and track us. **Add pre-crime programs into the mix with government agencies and corporations working in tandem to determine who is a *potential* danger and spin a sticky spider-web of [threat assessments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/the-new-way-police-are-surveilling-you-calculating-your-threat-score/2016/01/10/e42bccac-8e15-11e5-baf4-bdf37355da0c_story.html), behavioral sensing warnings, flagged \"words,\" and \"suspicious\" activity reports using automated eyes and ears, social media, [behavior sensing software](http://vator.tv/news/2013-04-13-google-picks-up-behavioral-sensing-company-behavio), and citizen spies, and you having the makings for a perfect dystopian nightmare.** This is the kind of oppressive [pre-crime](http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/whats-your-threat-score) and [pre-thought](http://truthinmedia.com/california-police-dept-determine-threat-score/) crime package foreshadowed by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Phillip K.

This is the creepy, calculating yet diabolical genius of the American police state: the very technology we hailed as revolutionary and liberating has become our prison, jailer, probation officer, Big Brother and Father Knows Best all rolled into one. It turns out that *we* are Soylent Green. The 1973 film of the same name, starring Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson, is set in 2022 in an overpopulated, polluted, starving New York City whose inhabitants depend on synthetic foods manufactured by the Soylent Corporation for survival. Heston plays a policeman investigating a murder, who discovers the grisly truth about the primary ingredient in the wafer, soylent green, which is the principal source of nourishment for a starved population. \"It's people. Soylent Green is made out of people,\" declares Heston's character. \"They're making our food out of people. Next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle for food.\" Oh, how right he was.

Without constitutional protections in place to guard against encroachments on our rights when power, technology and militaristic governance converge, it won't be long before we find ourselves, much like Edward G. Robinson's character in *Soylent Green*, looking back on the past with longing, back to an age where we could speak to whom we wanted, buy what we wanted, think what we wanted, and go where we wanted without those thoughts, words and movements being tracked, processed and stored by corporate giants such as Google, sold to government agencies such as the NSA and CIA, and used against us by militarized police with their army of futuristic technologies.

Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled \"COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data.\" From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19. She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States. After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared. Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same. \"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals,\" Briand said.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deaths-censorship-questions.txt:0:1a6b1d909726", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10668, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deaths-censorship-questions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deaths-censorship-questions", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "COVID-19.

In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same. \"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals,\" Briand said. Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths. These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States. This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception? To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward. Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia. \"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes,\" Briand pointed out. When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes. *COURTESY OF GENEVIEVE BRIAND * *Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.* This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years.

Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19. *COURTESY OF GENEVIEVE BRIAND * *Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19. * The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease. \"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary,\" Briand concluded. In an interview with The News-Letter, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases. \"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,\" Briand replied. In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning. Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States. Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture - death in general. The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.

According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society. During an interview with The News-Letter after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks. \"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant,\" Dharmasena said. When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population. **Below is an explanation from Johns Hopkins' about why the study was retracted.** Editor's Note: After The News-Letter published this article on Nov. 22, it was brought to our attention that our coverage of Genevieve Briand's presentation \"COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data\" has been used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic. We decided on Nov. 26 to retract this article to stop the spread of misinformation, as we noted on social media. However, it is our responsibility as journalists to provide a historical record. We have chosen to take down the article from our website, but it is available here as a PDF. In accordance with our standards for transparency, we are sharing with our readers how we came to this decision. The News-Letter is an editorially and financially independent, student-run publication. Our articles and content are not endorsed by the University or the School of Medicine, and our decision to retract this article was made independently. Briand's study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As assistant director for the Master's in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher. At her talk, she herself stated that more research and data are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S. Briand was quoted in the article as saying, \"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths.

Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers.\" This claim is incorrect and does not take into account the spike in raw death count from all causes compared to previous years. According to the CDC, there have been almost 300,000 excess deaths due to COVID-19. Additionally, Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic. This evidence does not disprove the severity of COVID-19; an increase in excess deaths is not represented in these proportionalities because they are offered as percentages, not raw numbers. Briand also claimed in her analysis that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may be incorrectly categorized as COVID-19-related deaths. However, COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with preexisting conditions, so those with those underlying conditions are statistically more likely to be severely affected and die from the virus. Because of these inaccuracies and our failure to provide additional information about the effects of COVID-19, The News-Letter decided to retract this article. It is our duty as a publication to combat the spread of misinformation and to enhance our fact-checking process. We apologize to our readers.

Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci ... and that will alarm every American - Democrat or Republican - who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children's health. ***The Real Anthony Fauci***** reveals how \"America's Doctor\" launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. **Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. **In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates' $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential.** Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:0:01d43f8feeb6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10673, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. **In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates' $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential.** Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy. *The Real Anthony Fauci* details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent. **#1 on AMAZON**, and a national bestseller in the *NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY *and *PUBLISHERS WEEKLY* \"RFK Jr.'s story of Fauci's failure as the government's AIDS coordinator is a highly disturbing prologue to his COVID mandate as head of NIAID.

Kennedy, Jr.* While the main title of Kennedy's new book bears the name of Fauci, one need only read as far as the subtitle to realize that this book is much more broadly about the global overthrow of constitutional democracy. Fauci and Gates get special naming in the title because they built what I will call the Global Pharma Machine. The climax of the book, however, covers the rise of the biosecurity state that hijacked this machine to turn it from a profiteering scheme into an overthrow of constitutional governance, with the major orchestrators being more behind-the-scenes members of the military-intelligence complex, with strong connections to the CIA. Nevertheless, Fauci and Gates even have a hand in that part. **What follows is not a critical review where I pull apart each of Kennedy's claims and check it against the evidence found in each of his 2,124 in-text citations. That's not to say that I didn't study the book carefully. **At the end, I include some personal reflections. Until then, I rely on the facts that Kennedy relays in the book to tell the story as I see it. . **The Titular Characters** Let's start by outlining the two main characters from the title of the book. Anthony Fauci Fauci has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for over 30 years. **With a yearly salary of $417,608, Fauci is the [highest-paid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/01/25/dr-anthony-fauci-the-highest-paid-employee-in-the-entire-us-federal-government/) of all approximately four million federal employees. He makes even more money than the president. Yet, this is just his base pay. ** NIH employees are allowed to earn royalties from patents held by the NIH. Each employee can earn up to $150,000 per year for each patent. Fauci has never disclosed to the public how many patents he earns royalties from (although analysis of US patents bearing his name", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:2:ed05abe76a0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10675, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "**With a yearly salary of $417,608, Fauci is the [highest-paid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/01/25/dr-anthony-fauci-the-highest-paid-employee-in-the-entire-us-federal-government/) of all approximately four million federal employees. He makes even more money than the president. Yet, this is just his base pay. ** NIH employees are allowed to earn royalties from patents held by the NIH. Each employee can earn up to $150,000 per year for each patent. Fauci has never disclosed to the public how many patents he earns royalties from (although analysis of US patents bearing his name suggests there are eight). This, of course, is to say nothing of speaking fees he earns from companies whose drugs he brokers the approval of. Fauci's public mandate as head of NIAID is to investigate and prevent not only infectious disease but allergic, autoimmune, and chronic disease. Since 1989, five years after he took over NIAID, asthma, eczema, food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and anaphylaxis have exploded. Autoimmune diseases like juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, and Crohn's disease were practically unheard of before Fauci took power and are now epidemics. Diagnosed autism is up 100-fold. Chronic illnesses afflicted 12.8 percent of children when Fauci took power in 1984, and now afflict 54 percent of children. Over the same period of time, America went from one of the healthiest industrialized nations to having the highest infant mortality and lowest life expectancy from among them, and American children lost seven points in IQ. By the end of the decade, obesity, diabetes, and pre-diabetes are on track to debilitate 85% of Americans. **While these data do not show that Fauci caused the decline in public health that occurred while he was in office, in any other sector he would be removed from office as a failure.** For example, if he were an elected official, his opponent would ask voters, \"do your kids have more allergies or fewer allergies than they did four years ago?\" and voters would get rid of him. If he were the CEO of a company that lost a dollar for each chronic illness and gained a dollar for each such illness averted, he'd be fired for poor performance. Fauci's tenure at NIAID only makes sense when we see him in a different light. Fauci as a Power Broker **Fauci is best seen as a power broker. By controlling the flow of research dollars, by cutting off research dollars to scientists who veer in unapproved directions, by censuring journalists that if they say the wrong thing they will lose access to scientists, and by allowing pharmaceutical companies to cut corners and get away with bad science when they are on his side, Fauci has an army of scientists, doctors, journalists, and companies who learn to play his game. If they do his bidding well, they get the research dollars or access to scientists they need. If they don't, they get shut out.** In 2010, Fauci told *New Yorker* writer Michael", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:3:4d92c5ad9cc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10676, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "if they say the wrong thing they will lose access to scientists, and by allowing pharmaceutical companies to cut corners and get away with bad science when they are on his side, Fauci has an army of scientists, doctors, journalists, and companies who learn to play his game. If they do his bidding well, they get the research dollars or access to scientists they need. If they don't, they get shut out.** In 2010, Fauci told *New Yorker* writer Michael Specter that his political playbook was *The Godfather* and that his favorite line from it was \"It's nothing personal, it's strictly business.\" [Verify in [this CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/dr-anthony-fauci-on-lesson-from-the-godfather-book-.html)] Fauci as An Authoritarian **Fauci's authoritarian tendencies are best demonstrated by his handling of AIDS, where he used his control of research funding and threats to journalists to quash dissent.** **His megalomaniacal June 9, 2021 declaration that \"[Attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fauci-interview-today-science-covid-b1862899.html),\" could be fully forecast by his entire handling of AIDS, in which he decided that he, and no one else, was the final arbiter of acceptable science.** Kennedy devotes four entire chapters to this topic. He does not take the position that HIV is not a cause of AIDS. \"For the record,\" he writes, \"I believe that HIV is a cause of AIDS, but... causation is more complex than the official theology.\" This is clear from the fact that only half of AIDS patients have HIV, that huge numbers of HIV-infected individuals never develop AIDS, and that non-HIV AIDS often occurs in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a connection never adequately followed up on. Kennedy takes no position on which of the alternative hypotheses are true, but describes a number that he believes clearly have enough merit to be investigated. These include the toxicity of nitrite \"poppers,\" heavily marketed by the pharmaceutical industry toward gays in the 1980s, the toxicity of AZT, used as a drug to treat HIV and supposedly delay the development of AIDS, other viruses such as human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), and mycoplasma. While Kennedy doesn't subscribe to the hypothesis that HIV is merely a free rider (maintained by Peter Duesberg), or that HIV is entirely generated from within human cells (maintained by Eleni Papadopulos and Val Turner), he believes these hypotheses should be acknowledged and considered. Fauci responded to these nuances of evidence and diversity of hypotheses by declaring HIV as the sole cause of AIDS and shutting down any dissent. Peter Duesberg, a Berkley molecular biologist and pioneer in cancer genetics, had been awarded every single NIH grant he had applied for prior to 1987. Ever since 1987 when he ran into loggerheads with Fauci, however, every single one of his 30 NIH proposals was rejected.

Ever since 1987 when he ran into loggerheads with Fauci, however, every single one of his 30 NIH proposals was rejected. Duesberg has been tarnished as an \"AIDS denialist,\" yet even Luc Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize in 2008 for his discovery of HIV, had stated at the San Francisco International AIDS Conference in 1990 that \"HIV might be benign.\" In fact, Fauci even cut off funding for HHV6 research, even though the HHV6 hypothesis was pioneered by Robert Gallo. Gallo had essentially stolen HIV from Montagnier. He was labeled as \"co-discoverer\" of it with Montagnier by agreement of the French and American governments, but rather than sharing the Nobel with Montagnier he was subject to two governmental ethics investigations. Gallo's research had been the basis of the Department of Health and Human Services (parent of NIH and the CDC) declaring that AIDS research would only receive funding if it conformed to the HIV hypothesis, yet even Gallo ran afoul of Fauci enough to have his HHV6 hypothesis consigned to history's dustbin of unfunded research. **In June of 1996, Fauci suddenly aborted a $16 million study involving about 100 independent scientists that was, in part, examining why many people with HIV never develop AIDS. The study was two years in, and *Newsweek* reported that Fauci abruptly cutting it off may have been retaliation for a group of younger scientists criticizing the NIH for only funding AIDS research centered on HIV.** Fauci doesn't just yank funding when people cross him. He wields his power over journalists too. In September, 1989, Fauci broadcast a threat to journalists who give a platform to Duesberg. \"Journalists who have made too many mistakes or who are sloppy,\" he threatened, \"are going to find that their access to scientists may diminish.\" **Kennedy alleges that Fauci cut off any funding that threatened his lucrative AIDS drug empire, built on using drugs like AZT to kill the HIV virus. Regardless of Fauci's ultimate motivations, Fauci transformed the practice of science - which should be about open-minded inquiry - into a process where he decided the boundaries of acceptable inquiry and scientists and journalists either fell in line or were cut off.** Fauci as Shrewd and Callous Toward Suffering Kennedy portrays Fauci as shrewd, calculating, and callous toward the suffering of others, especially children. If this is accurate, it would go a long way toward explaining how Fauci seems unphased by the mushrooming of chronic disease that has occurred during his tenure.

The most chilling example of this from among many given in the book is his experiments on orphans and foster kids. **Between 1998 and 2002, Fauci oversaw AIDS drug experiments conducted on HIV-positive foster children, most of whom were poor and Black or Latino, many of whom were orphans.** These occurred in New York City, New York State, and six other states. They were done under the auspices of NIAID with Fauci loyalists in charge of oversight. **Large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Genetech, and Chiron/Biocine sponsored them and paid the foster care centers for use of the children. **At least 465 children were involved in NYC, and more than two thirds of them were not even given an advocate, which is blatantly illegal. Later investigations revealed that many of the children were perfectly healthy and some weren't even shown to be infected with HIV. **The drugs used were known to be toxic to DNA, skin, internal organs, bone marrow, and the brain. If the children resisted the drugs, they were held down and force-fed. If they continued to resist, they were taken to the hospital and force-fed by stomach tube. At least 80 kids in the Manhattan experiments died and were reportedly buried in mass graves. **In one mass grave found in Hawthorne, NY, there was a large pit covered in AstroTurf in which there were about 100 haphazardly stacked coffins. Most of the coffins had more than one child in them. A [BBC documentary,*Guinea Pig Kids*](https://www.guineapigkids.com/), was made about these experiments. On March 8, 2004, the NIH rejected a Freedom of Information Act request for the adverse event reports from those trials on the grounds of \"trade secrets\" and \"privacy\" exemptions. Two subsequent investigations by FDA and the Office of Human Research Protections confirmed that the trials deprived the foster kids of legally mandated protections against research risks. In Kennedy's portrayal, **Fauci seems to regard disadvantaged children as fodder for a huge profiteering machine, which he has constructed by establishing himself as global science's preeminent power broker and with his authoritarian silencing of dissent.** Bill Gates **Bill Gates is about one thing: monopoly.** **He specializes in acquiring market share, no matter who he must screw over to get it.** Gates co-founded Microsoft in 1975 with Paul Allen, his closest boyhood friend.

Gates tried to buy him out of Microsoft at $5 a share, but he refused and later sold his stake when the company went public for a much higher price and left a billionaire. In May of 1998, the Department of Justice and twenty state attorneys general launched an anti-trust suit at Microsoft, aiming to break it up. After an appeal, the breakup ultimately failed and Gates was charged $800,000 for his anti-competitive practices. Gates Brings Monopoly to Public Health While this was a slap on the wrist for the world's richest man, Gates wanted to rehabilitate his image. Thus was born the Children's Vaccine Program with its first $100 million. That year Gates also donated a $500 million grant from the William H. Gates Foundation (founded in 1994, becoming the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation later in 2000) to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), founded two years earlier by the Rockefeller Foundation, launching a new global initiative to develop a vaccine that would erase AIDS from the face of the earth (no luck yet). **In 2000, Gates invited Fauci to a dinner party in his mansion, then took Fauci alone into the library and said to him, \"Tony, you run the biggest infectious disease institute of the world. And I want to be sure the money I spend is well spent. Why don't we really get to know each other? Why don't we be partners?\"** Gates went on to send seismic waves of influence through global public health policy over the next two decades, using his vast sums of money to buy influence, ranging from acting as a public health thought leader to using the bully pulpit and even seeming, in the eyes of some, to have hand-picked the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Effectively, Gates turned his penchant for monopoly from computer software to global public health. The legacy of his involvement in global public health is to have shifted international aid away from traditional priorities of economic development and access to basic medical devices, off-patent essential drugs, food, and clean water toward selling higher-priced, generally patented, drugs and vaccines. **Gates and his foundations own stock in drug and vaccine companies like Merck, GSK, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Novartis, Sanofi, Gilead, Biogen, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, and Inovio. So the money comes back around to Gates.** The most absurd example of how this is a complete derangement of priorities is the case of the polio vaccine.

So the money comes back around to Gates.** The most absurd example of how this is a complete derangement of priorities is the case of the polio vaccine. In 2011 and 2012 polio only affected between 200 and 300 people per year in India and only 2000 people a year globally. Gates used his own funds as well as his bully pulpit to rally public funds from rich and poor nations alike to obliterate these last cases of a mostly eradicated disease. Only **he used a cheap version of the vaccine containing live virus that itself became the major cause of polio across the globe. Incidence of diagnosed polio increased in India, and some Indian doctors blame the vaccine for additionally paralyzing almost half a million kids** from \"acute flaccid myelitis,\" a disease that used to be called \"polio\" but has been renamed to avoid counting polio vaccine-induced neurological side effects as \"polio.\" Meanwhile, in contrast to the ridiculously low yearly global incidence of polio, 840 million people don't have enough to eat, one billion lack clean water or access to sanitation, and one billion are illiterate. The diversion of international aid away from economic development and access to basic medical devices, basic medicines, food, and clean water may be killing a lot more people than it is saving. **Kennedy cites a [*Los Angeles Times*investigation](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-xpm-2007-dec-16-la-na-gates16dec16-story.html) finding that \"overall, child mortality improved more often in nations that received smaller than average GAVI [a Gates initiative] grants per capita. In seven nations that received greater than average funding, child mortality rates worsened.** Gates Values Monopoly Over Public Health That Gates is more interested in monopoly than saving lives is illustrated by his active defense of intellectual property when it comes into conflict with access to drugs and vaccines among poor countries. **He advocated for the side of patents at the WHO in the late 1990s when Nelson Mandela was trying to get locally produced generic AIDS drugs in South Africa, and even opposed later attempts to create fully voluntary intellectual property pools for AIDS drugs.** In mid-2020, there was a movement at the WHO to create a voluntary intellectual property pool around COVID vaccines called C-TAP. Gates undermined it by promoting the COVID Vaccine Capacity Connector, a program that would make sure patents stayed with their original owners during any sharing of technology. Thus, the overall role of Gates in global public health is to accrue monopoly power over public health institutions and drug and vaccine distribution ... possibly at the expense of increasing morbidity and mortality across the globe. **Anatomy of The Global Pharma Machine** Kennedy uses the familiar term \"Big", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:8:fac4f6f5f427", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10681, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "COVID vaccines called C-TAP.

Thus, the overall role of Gates in global public health is to accrue monopoly power over public health institutions and drug and vaccine distribution ... possibly at the expense of increasing morbidity and mortality across the globe. **Anatomy of The Global Pharma Machine** Kennedy uses the familiar term \"Big Pharma\" in his title. It seems to me, however, that over the course of nine chapters - chapters 2 through 10 - he maps out a global system that is far more concrete than simply being \"Big.\" I believe this system deserves a name, so I am tentatively christening it \"The Global Pharma Machine.\" What follows is the basic anatomy of this machine, as I glean it from those nine chapters. CDC and NIAID act as incubators for drugs and vaccines This model is generally true across agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that fund research. These include CDC as well as NIAID and the other NIH institutes. Here is a typical example of how this works. **NIAID funds the basic science for a new candidate pharmaceutical and patents it. Once the candidate appears promising, NIAID hands it over to a network of roughly 1,300 principal investigators (PIs) working for universities to conduct clinical trials on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies who will wind up selling the drug and who provide the lion's share of the funding. ** **The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the parent of both CDC and NIAID, then transfers a portion of the patent rights through its Office of Technology Transfer to the stakeholders: these may include public officials at the NIAID, the universities hosting the PIs' research, and the pharmaceutical companies. The universities may then share patent rights with the PIs.** Across NIAID, CDC, and the other agencies governed by HHS, 4,400 patents are owned. **Fauci's major role in this is to control $7.6 billion of NIAID funding per year that finds its way into patentable products, of which he appears to co-own eight. However, by acting as a confidante to six presidents, Fauci has brokered the flow of tens of billions more dollars than that figure suggests.** The PIs dominate the regulatory decisions Funding and intellectual property bind together the interests of NIAID/CDC, universities and their PIs, and pharmaceutical companies. **Typically, PIs work with a single pharmaceutical company. Thus, their first loyalty is to that company. However, the PI, university, and pharma company will all share loyalty toward the federal agency that provides them with incubated candidate drugs and vaccines and intellectual property.** These loyal PIs dominate the regulatory processes, populating committees such as the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and the CDC's Advisory", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:9:d4accea159d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10682, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "together the interests of NIAID/CDC, universities and their PIs, and pharmaceutical companies. **Typically, PIs work with a single pharmaceutical company.

As such, they ensure the dominance of the pharmaceutical industry's perspective throughout the regulatory process. The PIs, Pharma Dollars, and Gates run the press **From among these pharma-loyalist PIs are selected the handful that serve as television personalities, where they are branded as leading experts who deliver correct information and scorn \"misinformation.\"** **Fauci, of course, is the expert of all television experts: the one who is science himself.** **Meanwhile, the [pharmaceutical industry provides 75% of television advertising revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/953104/pharma-industry-tv-ad-spend-us/), meaning pharma literally pays large parts of the salaries of the anchors and everyone else on set.** Gates himself has spent at least $250 million to finance journalism, journalism training, and \"fact checking.\" The Gates Foundation regularly hosts \"strategic media partner\" meetings at its headquarters in Seattle aimed at improving the media narrative around the foundation's public health activities. (I would personally add here that the intelligence community also has their hand in \"fact-checking\" companies. For example, [NewsGuard](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1448370619091935232) is owned by a pharmaceutical PR firm and advised by the inventor of the NSA's warrantless wiretapping program.) Big Tech fits into this somewhere as well. Google, for example, through its parent company Alphabet, has lucrative relationships with all major pharmaceutical companies and outright owns several smaller vaccine companies. Follow the liability shield **Liability shields protect and incentivize the distribution of unsafe products, but from the pharmaceutical industry's perspective they protect their profits from being eaten away by lawsuits.** **Within the United States, a total liability shield for vaccines is provided by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act to any vaccine added to the CDC schedule for children or pregnant women. Once on the schedule for children or pregnant women, the liability shield applies to all Americans, even adult men.** **Liability protection is also given for drugs and vaccines developed during pandemics** declared by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act of 2005, so long as the emergency declared has no existing treatments that can be used early in the course of the disease. These liability shields are not in any way analogous to insurance underwriting. They are meant to provide liability for products that insurance companies would never agree to underwrite. In fact, **the 1986 Act was a response to the insurance markets for vaccines collapsing after a 1983 study finding that the DTP vaccine was killing one in every 300 babies that received it.** While", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:10:30387b0dcb23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10683, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "emergency declared has no existing treatments that can be used early in the course of the disease.

In fact, **the 1986 Act was a response to the insurance markets for vaccines collapsing after a 1983 study finding that the DTP vaccine was killing one in every 300 babies that received it.** While these acts protect US pharmaceutical companies from being sued by Americans, they don't guarantee liability protections for their products distributed abroad. The Alien Tort Claims Act would allow non-Americans to sue American companies regardless of the liability protections described above. This requires more creative solutions. For example, Pfizer distributes Depo-Provera in Africa through the Gates-funded PATH, a global organization that falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of the WHO. Using an international surrogate to distribute the shots allows Pfizer to exclude the FDA's black box warning about fatal bone loss without being sued by the survivors of anyone who dies of bone loss through the Alien Tort Claims Act. These liability shields greatly incentivize additions of vaccines to the CDC schedule, since these result in nearly universal vaccination of children yet complete protection from all liability. They also incentivize emergency use of drugs and vaccines under the PREP Act and creative dodging of liability in foreign countries. Gates controls the World Health Organization Gates distributes funding to the WHO through a collection of organizations. These include the Gates Foundation, UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund), GAVI (originally the \"Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations,\" now rebranded as \"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\"), SAGE (the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, which advises the WHO about vaccines), and Rotary International. **The total annual Gates funding comes to $1 billion, about 18% of the total WHO budget. **SAGE is also populated with Gates-funded experts, extending his influence on their vaccine policy even further. The election of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as WHO director general seemed to reflect Gates' power. He is the first person in that position with no medical degree, but was close to Gates when he served on the board of GAVI and was chair of the board of the Global Fund, both founded and funded by Gates. By establishing control over the World Health Organization, Gates massively redirected global public health policy toward drugs and vaccines that would be profitable to the pharmaceutical industry. GAVI redirects international aid toward locking poor countries into vaccine-related debt The Gates-founded and Gates-funded GAVI acts as an international bank that locks poor countries into vaccine-related debt. The WHO pressures the poor country to buy the vaccine with debt. GAVI cosigns the debt with funding provided by rich donor countries. Thus, GAVI accelerates the Gates-induced shift away from traditional forms of aid (cheap off-patent medicines, basic medical supplies,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:11:d06d6262f890", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10684, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "drugs and vaccines that would be profitable to the pharmaceutical industry.

Thus, GAVI accelerates the Gates-induced shift away from traditional forms of aid (cheap off-patent medicines, basic medical supplies, economic development, and access to food and clean water) toward more expensive drugs and vaccines, but focuses more specifically on locking these countries into vaccine-related debt. Outsource unethical trials and dump toxic pharmaceuticals into poor countries Pharmaceutical companies spend 90% of their R&D funds on phase III clinical trials, and these trials occur during the period the patent is active. As a result, anything that delays a clinical trial, such as an adverse event, eats into the length of time the patent can be used to sell high-priced products. **In the 1980s, these companies began moving clinical trials to poor countries, especially in Africa, where they could pay subjects less for participating and could lower their ethical standards and easily get away with violations.** Pharmaceuticals that are expired, defective, or too toxic to use in rich Western countries are often dumped into poor countries of Africa, Asia, and Central America. This has only accelerated as Gates' influence over the WHO has increased. WHO ties funding to poor countries based on vaccine uptake, which pressures the countries to act as release valves for the global stock of low-quality vaccines. This is the Global Pharma Machine in one broad stroke To put it all together: **HHS agencies such as CDC and NIAID act as incubators for drugs and vaccines. Their public officials profit from royalties on the patents. Fauci governs a huge chunk of the funding that facilitates this.** **Universities and often their PIs share in the patent royalties. The PIs dominate the regulatory approval and serve as experts in the press, with Fauci at their head.** **Pharma funding pays the salaries of everyone on TV, and Gates training refines the media narrative in his favor.** **Pharmaceutical companies use liability shields wherever they can to insulate themselves against lawsuits for unsafe products.** **Gates has moved global institutions toward hooking the entire world on high-cost vaccines and drugs, often at the expense of basic necessities, and in some cases locking them into vaccine-related debt.** **Testing drugs and vaccines in poor countries reduces the costs associated with the research, often at the expense of ethical standards and subject safety, and extends the useful life of patents. These countries then act as a release valve to absorb stocks of expired, defective, or unsafe drugs and vaccines that could not be distributed in developed countries.** **Rise of the Biosecurity State** We are in the midst of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:12:a7eb27f9c4f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10685, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "basic necessities, and in some cases locking them into vaccine-related debt.** **Testing drugs and vaccines in poor countries reduces the costs associated with the research, often at the expense of ethical standards and subject safety, and extends the useful life of patents.

However, the rollout of lockdowns, speech suppression, social distancing, forced masking, and track-and-tracing has a clear origin in two decades of \"scenario planning\" simulation that were first applied to infectious diseases shortly before 9/11 and dramatically accelerated in the year leading up to COVID. These simulations often involved familiar names like Fauci, Gates, Johns Hopkins, and the Rockefeller Foundation. **Former CIA officer and whistleblower Kevin Schipp described these scenario planning simulations as \"brainwashing exercises\" in which \"thousands of public health and law enforcement officials . . . participate in blowing up the US Bill of Rights.\"** Two architects of this scenario planning deserve special mention: Peter Schwartz and Robert Kadlec. Peter Schwartz Peter Schwartz has deep connections to both the CIA and the technology world. In 1972, Schwartz joined the Stanford Research Initiative and later rose to run it at a time when it was hosting the CIA's MKUltra project to study psychological warfare techniques that included propaganda, mind control, and torture. Then he left to become head of Scenario Planning for the oil and gas company Shell. Scenario planning simulations were first used by the military in World War II, but entered the corporate world in the 70s and 80s. Schwartz pioneered scenario planning at Shell and then cofounded the Global Business Network in 1987 to use the process for Shell and other corporate clients. This overlapped with the period where Shell had major oil holdings in Nigeria and the Nigerian government harassed environmental activists opposed to Shell's activities and even executed one by military tribunal. In the early 1990s, Schwartz tried recruiting Ken McCarthy, an entrepreneur who played a major role in commercializing the Internet, to a research project that involved \"weakening tribal and family structures\" in a West African country \"on behalf of a federal government.\" McCarthy found the proposal disturbing and declined involvement. In 1993, **Schwartz played a major role in the founding of *Wired* magazine.** Its seed funding came from Nicholas Negroponte, whose brother John was later named by George W. Bush the first Director of National Intelligence, a position so powerful even the Director of the CIA directly reports to it. ***Wired***** copied the look and feel of *Mondo 2000*, the original tech and culture magazine of the San Francisco Bay Area.

However, it shifted the attitude away from progressive idealism toward glorification of military, intelligence, and corporate achievements.** Timothy Leary called it \"the CIA's answer to *Mondo 2000*,\" and many speculated it was a CIA front operation meant to infiltrate the minds and hearts of the technology community. Indeed, *Wired* shot to prominence around the year 2000, when the CIA founded In-Q-Tel, an investment firm that allowed it to infiltrate tech startups. CEOs who accepted In-Q-Tel contracts became among the estimated 4.8 million Americans subject to \"State Secret Contracts\" who can be sent to jail for twenty years and have their property seized for so much as talking about the contract. **Schwartz seemed to be stunningly good at predicting things. In the year 2000, he was involved in a Senate study where he suggested \"the horrifying possibility of terrorists flying planes into the World Trade Center.\"** Schwartz would later go on to serve as the author of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded 2010 \"Lock Step\" simulation. Robert Kadlec Robert Kadlec is a physician and retired colonel in the US Air Force. Kadlec became an advocate for military strategy defense against bioweapons in the 1990s. From that time onward, he was generally surrounded by and working with people from the intelligence community. Kadlec started scenario planning for smallpox with the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies and the Department of Health and Human Services in 1999. Tara O'Toole, who had been a director of the CIA's In-Q-Tel, was a co-founder of the Johns Hopkins Center, a senior fellow, and became its second director. Its third director was Tom Inglesby. Inglesby, O'Toole, and Johns Hopkins would be found repeatedly in scenario planning events further down the road. Kadlec was the lead organizer of the Pentagon's 2001 Dark Winter simulation, which featured heavy CIA involvement. Many scenario planning simulations followed this over the next twenty years, and CIA involvement was a major feature of all of them.

Trump appointed him as Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response from August 2017 to January 2021. This put him in the lead position to manage the COVID-19 response when that time came. **At least as far back as Kadlec's 1999 smallpox simulation at Johns Hopkins, the focus was mask and vaccine mandates, lockdowns, track-and-tracing, and censorship. Kadlec's career is thus remarkable for having managed COVID-19 under Trump, yet having promoted these types of responses more than twenty years earlier.** Two Decades of Scenario Planning Kennedy outlines 16 specific scenario planning events. These include the Kadlec/Johns Hopkins simulation of 1999, TOPOFF (2000), Dark Winter (2001), Atlantic Storm (2003), TOPOFF 2 (2003), Global Mercury (2003), Atlantic Storm (2005), TOPOFF 3 (2005), SCL Simulation (2005), TOPOFF 4 (2007), Lock Step (2010), MARS (2017), SPARS (2017), Clade X (2018), Crimson Contagion (2019), and Event 201 (2019). **I strongly encourage you to read the entire last chapter of the book if you read nothing else, where these are covered in detail.** Here are a few highlights: **The TOPOFF simulations pioneered \"stay-at-home\" orders in response to simulated bioweapons attacks.** They started in 2000 with the Department of Justice, FBI, and FEMA. As they progressed, however, they recruited more and more state and local officials and even foreign governments. They grew to include 250 federal, state, and local agencies, businesses, and volunteer groups, and 23,000 participants. The second simulation in 2003 brought in the Canadian government, and the third in 2005 coordinated with Canada and the UK. The SCL 2005 simulation was a private sector event at a UK annual military technology showcase. It featured scientists who could see the signs that a smallpox epidemic was threatening, but knew they wouldn't be able to convince the population to comply with a lockdown on that basis alone. A media company steps in to save the day with a disinformation campaign to spread a lie that a cloud of toxic chemicals has been unleashed. This then leads the population to comply. In **Schwartz's 2010 Rockefeller-funded \"Lock Step\" simulation**, **a novel strain of influenza leads world leaders to impose mandatory masks and temperature checks. And then this chilling paragraph: \"Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified.

In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems-from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty-leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power.\"** The MARS 2017 simulation expanded the scenario planning to a global scale. The Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, World Bank, WHO, and the Robert Koch Institute collaborated to lead ministers from the G20 (the European Union and the 19 richest nations outside the EU) through a simulation with a \"mountain-associated respiratory virus\" (MARS) as the culprit. The SPARS 2017 simulation was convened by Gates at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. **Among those present were two people from the CIA's In-Q-Tel, and Matthew Shearer of Johns Hopkins who later was the one to find the first COVID cases in Seattle.** **SPARS was a novel coronavirus, and its simulated pandemic lasted three years, finally ending with vaccine mandates.** Blacks, alternative medicine advocates, and a rapidly growing anti-vaccine movement say the vaccine hasn't been adequately tested. Media and government cooperate to silence dissent and to scorn the vaccine-hesitant. Mid-pandemic, it turns out that the virus is not as deadly as CDC had initially predicted, which further endangers the vaccine. CDC and FDA join forces to use scare tactics to induce vaccination. After a year of appearing safe, the vaccine begins to generate severe neurological side effects. However, these are rare enough to be marginalized. Gates encouraged this to be seen as \"preparing for war.\" The **Clade X 2018 simulation was hosted at Johns Hopkins and featured an otherwise harmless parainfluenza virus that was genetically engineered to be more deadly by a group advocating depopulation, and leaked from a lab on purpose. Attendees included representatives from the CIA, FDA, CDC, and media. One of them was Susan Brooks, who had introduced a bill, The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014, to establish a Social Media Bureau within the Department of Homeland Security that would facilitate censorship of social media during emergencies.** In May of 2018, Gates, with the WHO and World Bank, created the **Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, to solidify the lessons of the simulations so that the lockdowns, forced masking, stay-at-home orders, disinformation campaigns, and vaccine mandates could be easily deployed on a global scale.

The purpose was to evangelize the state and local bureaucracies with the lessons of the scenario planning simulations. It included 100 centers, 19 federal departments and agencies, 12 states, 15 tribal nations and pueblos, 74 local health departments and coalitions, 87 hospitals, and over 100 health care organizations. **A novel influenza virus from China was the culprit, and it appeared remarkably predictive of the COVID crisis right down to the number of deaths.** **Event 201 was held two months later, in October 2019.** This was three weeks after the first COVID cases are now thought to have started circulating, but before they were clearly recognized in the media. It was five months before the WHO declared a pandemic. It was organized by Gates and included a former CIA and NSA director, representatives of the World Bank, World Economic Forum, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the CDC, Chinese government, Johnson and Johnson and other pharmaceutical companies, and corporate PR firms. **The culprit was a novel coronavirus. One of the aims was to censor claims that it had leaked from a lab. **Another was to censor people who blamed the pharmaceutical industry. **Among the ideas circulated were tracking social media posts betraying \"negative beliefs,\" withholding data about infections and fatalities, and arresting dissidents for spreading \"fake news.\"** **After reading about these, there should be nothing surprising about how quickly the world fell into \"lock step\" in its response to COVID. Architects of the biosecurity state had been training leaders of government, community, media, and business to respond like this for over twenty years.** **Given how uniformly the world fell into \"lock step,\" the words from Schwartz's Rockefeller-funded report bearing that name are even more chilling:** **\"Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems-from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty-leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power.**\" Cashing in on COVID Set against this backdrop, the Global Pharma Machine was ready in place to profit from COVID, and the biosecurity state had been preparing for twenty years to use such a crisis for its ascent.

Fauci had been recruited to the service of the biosecurity state by this time, and Gates had risen to the status of a chief architect. **Vaccines and drugs followed the pattern of the Global Pharma System like clockwork:** **HIV trials in Africa were quickly repurposed to become COVID vaccine trials.** **Federal agencies put in money and manpower to hand off intellectual property and profits to Big Pharma.** **Gates stepped in to make sure intellectual property didn't get pooled, so that poor countries would be charged top dollar (with some charitable freebies and discounts) for the vaccines.** **All potential treatments were initially shunned so that the vaccines could gain liability shield status under the PREP Act.** **The one exception was remdesivir. Fauci had given $6 million to Ralph Baric, of gain-of-function fame, to develop remdesivir as a treatment for coronaviruses in 2017. Gates has a $6.5 million stake in Gilead, the company that makes it. It costs $10 a pop to produce, and is administered for $3,000-5,000 a pop, quite the markup. Remdesivir could be used because as a late-stage injectable for severe cases, it didn't interfere with the vaccines' liability shield. Only effective early treatment would have interfered.** **Off-patent drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were shunned to make way for newly patented drugs that would be released once the vaccine liability shield was no longer an issue.** **The vaccine is pushed on children as quickly as possible so that the liability shield can be transferred to the 1986 Act. Once children are on the CDC schedule, the liability shield of the PREP Act is no longer needed, and early treatment drugs are fair game.** **Merck's patent for ivermectin ran out in 1996. As a result, ivermectin costs 40 cents per dose and must be shunned. Molnupiravir, originally developed to treat horses for equine encephalitis, is based on the same mechanism of action as ivermectin and will take its place, since it costs $700 per dose.** **In 2020, workers lost $3.7 trillion, while billionaires gained $3.9 trillion. 493 new billionaires were minted, while 8 million new people were plunged into poverty.** **Gates alone grew his wealth by $23 billion.** There are many other examples of profiteers looting the COVID crisis given in this book.

The lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, propaganda campaigns, forced masking, social distancing, vaccine mandates, and censoring and shaming of the vaccine hesitant were quickly borrowed from the two decades of scenario planning and swiftly deployed. But exactly who is cashing in on this power grab? To where does it lead? **The scenario planning simulations were all highly enriched with CIA associates. Peter Schwartz, with connections to MKUltra, played a significant role in their architecture. In 1960, research done under the auspices of MKUltra by Lawrence Hinkle of Cornell had identified *social isolation* as the most promising of all mind-control techniques. They found it had similar effects as beating someone, starving them, or depriving them of sleep.** Given the role of seeing faces in social connection, one cannot help but wonder if masking is simply an extension of social isolation. I must repeat for the third time here, Schwartz's chilling statement from his 2010 Lock Step simulation: \"Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems-from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty-leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power.\" While Kennedy does not cover Central Bank Digital Currencies in his book, I do believe that totalitarian behavioral economics tied to every aspect of our finances is the next step in this \"firmer grip on power,\" for reasons I outlined [in this video](https://youtu.be/6Da4rlB7QM4). **Regardless of exactly what direction the \"firmer grip on power\" takes, Kennedy correctly identifies this as a \"march towards a global police state\" and calls on us to stop it \"by calling on our moral courage.\"** Some Personal Reflections I applaud Kennedy's courage and integrity in writing this book. He is risking a lot in doing this, and to me he is a hero. I wrote this review not as a critical analysis, but as a means of digesting for myself and presenting to you what I had learned from it. This book was a herculean task written when time is of the essence. I cannot imagine every fact in the book or that every fact I restated here is correct. No book is written without errors.

I do intend, as time allows, to publish followup posts where I examine some of the claims with a critical eye, starting with those I have the most expertise in, on the biological front. As I wrote at the outset, this review represents the world as I see it when I look through the lens of Kennedy's book. I believe the explanatory lens of this book is of critical value and that it is absolutely necessary to spread it far and wide. There are many things that never made sense to me before, that only Kennedy is able to make sense. For example, the reasons for pushing the vaccine so hard on children: this makes no medical sense for a disease that primarily impacts old people and that has never killed a single child who didn't have serious preexisting health conditions. But it makes *perfect* sense once you realize it shifts the liability shield from the PREP Act to the 1986 Act so that the $700-a-dose ivermectin mimetic can be released. One thing that had been puzzling me for the last year: how did the whole world suddenly embrace masks on a dime? This just became more and more puzzling as I learned that **pre-COVID there were [nine randomized controlled trials](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/full) suggesting masks don't prevent transmission of the flu.** When Fauci's emails came out and cast him as genuinely believing masks were useless at the start of the pandemic, this made me even more puzzled. How did he so quickly adopt the opposite opinion when only the weakest of evidence was emerging to support it? It was starting to seem to me that someone must have tapped him on the shoulder and said, \"We're doing masks now.\" Now I have my answer: **there were two decades of scenario planning simulations done by the intelligence community and biosecurity state advocates using forced masking as universal parts of pandemic response. It was planned *twenty years in advance.***** In fact, this book even puts into much sharper relief the relation between the COVID response and the militaristic attack on raw milk and \"private food\" that occurred during the Obama administration. I knew these were connected somehow, but I had no idea how systematic the scenario planning of the rising biosecurity state had been. **The fact that the scenario planning spanned the George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump years with a coherent and consistent approach to using militaristic authoritarianism as a general response to the threat of microbes suddenly made it all make sense.** Undoubtedly, many will not make it past the title of this review because Kennedy is labeled an \"anti-vaxxer\" and a \"conspiracy theorist.\" While both of these have become overused words of dismissal and therefore are non-responses,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:20:54320c171aa6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10693, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "biosecurity state had been. **The fact that the scenario planning spanned the George W.

I cannot see that as Kennedy's motivation. Rather, **I see Kennedy's advocacy for vaccine safety and liability as a natural extension of his longstanding opposition to the capture of regulatory agencies by big industries. He explains it like this:** **\"My 40-year career as an environmental and public health advocate gave me a unique understanding of the corrupting mechanisms of 'regulatory capture,' the process by which the regulator becomes beholden to the industry it's meant to regulate. I spent four decades suing the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other environmental agencies to expose and remedy the corrupt sweetheart relationship that so often put regulators in bed with the polluting industries they regulated. ** **Among the hundreds of lawsuits I filed, perhaps a quarter were against regulatory officials making illegal concessions to Big Oil, King Coal, and the chemical and agricultural polluters that had captured their loyalties. I thought I knew everything about regulatory capture and that I had armored myself with an appropriate shield of cynicism. But I was wrong about that. ** **From the moment of my reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate in 2005, I was astonished to realize that the pervasive web of deep financial entanglements between Pharma and the government health agencies had put regulatory capture on steroids.\"** This strikes me as a completely honest description of his motivations. As to conspiracy theories, Kennedy has the correct approach to them in his book. That approach is to consider them like any other theory: be open-minded, but skeptical; consider the evidence; judge their plausibility and their likelihood of truth based on that evidence. For example, Kennedy asks why elected African leaders died of COVID at seven times the rate that would be expected based on their demographics. \"I do not endorse the theory that these men were murdered,\" he writes, \"nor do I dismiss such speculation out of hand.\" He considers a long history of Western intelligence agencies assassinating African leaders, and the extensive research the CIA put into assassination agents that would mimic natural deaths. He leaves the question open. **Since conspiracies are real and conspiracy theories can be true or false, \"conspiracy theory\" cannot be used in the context of a rational discussion as a term of dismissal.** **I heartily endorse Kennedy's even-handed approach to conspiracy theories.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt:21:e742656f0849", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10694, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-deception-fauci-gates-biosecurity-state", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "writes, \"nor do I dismiss such speculation out of hand.\" He considers a long history of Western intelligence agencies assassinating African leaders, and the extensive research the CIA put into assassination agents that would mimic natural deaths.

Almost 9% of total working hours were lost last year when compared with the levels of employment at the end of 2019, before the pandemic shuttered the economy, according to a separate report from the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency. That's the equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs lost across the globe, or about four times greater than the impact from the Great Recession of 2009. **The world's poorest could take a decade to regain their financial footing. Oxfam describes the pandemic's impact as \"the greatest rise in inequality since records began.\" The International Labour Organization said the crisis has been the most severe on work since the Great Depression in the 1930s.** \"Its impact is far greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009,\" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.

They were from a Dec. 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19**. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory. Dr. Kory is part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives. At the December hearing, he presented evidence regarding the use of ivermectin, a cheap and widely available drug that treats tropical diseases caused by parasites, for prevention and early treatment of Covid-19. He described a just-published study from Argentina in which about 800 health-care workers received ivermectin and 400 didn't. **Not one of the 800 contracted Covid-19; 58% of the 400 did. **Before being removed from YouTube and other websites, Dr. Kory's opening statement had been viewed by more than eight million people. Unfortunately, government health agencies don't share that interest in early treatment. A year into the pandemic, NIH treatment guidelines for Covid patients are to go home, isolate yourself and do nothing other than monitor your illness.

The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. Dr. Fauci played an important role in promoting the work. In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses ... bringing the total to $7.4 million. [One] phase of the project [included] gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. According to Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University,** the project ... would enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells and laboratory animals using techniques of genetic engineering. ****SARS-CoV-2, the virus now causing a global pandemic, is believed to have originated in bats.

Sweden also has a lower number of coronavirus deaths per million than those countries, all of which have gone under strict lockdowns during the pandemic. **Note:** The media has consistently compared Sweden to its immediate neighbors Finland and Norway, which have done much better than Sweden, but were not hit hard in the beginning as Sweden was.

The answer is obvious. You would want to protect against the worst cases. But that's not how the companies testing three of the leading coronavirus vaccine candidates, Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca ... are approaching the problem. **According to the protocols for their studies ... a vaccine could meet the companies' benchmark for success if it lowered the risk of mild Covid-19, but was never shown to reduce moderate or severe forms of the disease, or the risk of hospitalization, admissions to the intensive care unit or death**. To say a vaccine works should mean that most people no longer run the risk of getting seriously sick. That's not what these trials will determine. Influenza vaccines ... reduce the risk of mild disease in healthy adults. But there is no solid evidence they reduce the number of deaths. In fact, significant increases in vaccination rates over the past decades have [not been associated](https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.3.265) with reductions in deaths. Moderna and Pfizer acknowledge their vaccines appear to induce side effects that are similar to the symptoms of mild Covid-19.

They've watched helplessly as their meager savings dwindled away, as they were confined to their homes-prohibited from interacting with friends, attending church, temple or music and sporting events due to restrictions enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This resulted in a profound impact on the mental health and emotional well-being of people-leading to a significant increase in cases of anxiety, depression and deaths by suicide. The CDC conducted a survey of 5,412 people between June 24 and 30 and the collected data on suicides is alarming. **Roughly 25% percent of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 say they've [considered suicide](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/cdc-mental-health-pandemic-394832) because of the pandemic**. About 30.9% of the respondents said that they \"had symptoms of anxiety or depression\" and about 26.3% reported trauma and stress-related disorders caused by the outbreak. Over 13% said that they have used alcohol, prescription and/or illegal drugs to deal with their pandemic-induced stress and anxiety. The amount of Americans reporting anxiety symptoms is triple the number of this time last year. The CDC reported that [11% of adults surveyed](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/health/young-people-suicidal-ideation-wellness/index.html) had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days. The study showed \"19% of Hispanics reported suicidal ideation\" and \"15% of Blacks reported suicidal thoughts.\" **As it relates to young adults, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, said, \"We're seeing, sadly, [far greater suicides now](https://www.buckinstitute.org/covid-webinar-series-transcript-robert-redfield-md/) than we are deaths from [Covid-19].\"** **Note:** What this article glaringly failed to mention is that the large majority of these tragic problems are not caused by the virus, but rather by the lockdown policies.

Economists Bruce Meyer from the University of Chicago and James Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame found that the poverty rate increased by 2.4 percentage points during the latter half of 2020 as the U.S. continued to suffer the economic impacts of COVID-19. That percentage-point rise is nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s. This means an additional 8 million people nationwide are now considered poor. Moreover, the poverty rate for Black Americans is estimated to have jumped by 5.4 percentage points, or by 2.4 million individuals.

Ferguson has been criticised in the past for making predictions based on allegedly faulty assumptions which nevertheless shaped government strategies. **He was behind disputed research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease ... which ultimately led to the deaths of more than six million cattle, sheep and pigs.

The first was a viral pandemic that killed about one in 500 Americans-typically, a person over 75 suffering from other serious conditions. The second, and far more catastrophic, was a moral panic that swept the nation's guiding institutions. **Instead of keeping calm and carrying on, the American elite flouted the norms of governance, journalism, academic freedom-and, worst of all, science.** They misled the public about the origins of the virus and the true risk that it posed. Ignoring their own carefully prepared plans for a pandemic, they claimed unprecedented powers to impose untested strategies, with terrible collateral damage. **As evidence of their mistakes mounted, they stifled debate by vilifying dissenters, censoring criticism, and suppressing scientific research.** If, as seems increasingly plausible, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, it is the costliest blunder ever committed by scientists. Whatever the pandemic's origin, the response to it is the worst mistake in the history of the public-health profession. We still have no convincing evidence that the lockdowns saved lives, but lots of evidence that they have already [cost lives](https://www.city-journal.org/death-and-lockdowns) and will prove deadlier in the long run than the virus itself. **One in three people worldwide lost a job or a business during the lockdowns, and half saw their earnings drop, according to a [Gallup poll](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-global-workers/one-in-two-people-globally-lost-income-due-to-the-pandemic-gallup-idUSKBN2CK0BX).** Children, never at risk from the virus, in many places essentially lost a year of school.

They've promised to deploy these strategies again in the future, and they might even succeed in doing so-unless we begin to understand what went wrong. The panic was started, as usual, by journalists. As the virus spread early last year, they highlighted the most alarming statistics and the scariest images: the estimates of a fatality rate ten to 50 times higher than the flu, the chaotic scenes at hospitals in Italy and New York City, the predictions that national health-care systems were about to collapse. The full-scale panic was set off by the [release in March 2020](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) of a computer model at the Imperial College in London, which projected that-unless drastic measures were taken-intensive-care units would have 30 Covid patients for every available bed and that America would see 2.2 million deaths by the end of the summer. The British researchers announced that the \"only viable strategy\" was to impose draconian restrictions on businesses, schools, and social gatherings until a vaccine arrived. This extraordinary project was swiftly declared the \"consensus\" among public-health officials, politicians, journalists, and academics. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, endorsed it and became the unassailable authority for those purporting to \"follow the science.\" **What had originally been a limited lockdown-\"15 days to slow the spread\"-became long-term policy across much of the United States and the world.** A few scientists and public-health experts objected, noting that an extended lockdown was a novel strategy of unknown effectiveness that had been rejected in previous plans for a pandemic. It was a dangerous experiment being conducted without knowing the answer to the most basic question: Just how lethal is this virus? **The most prominent early critic was John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Stanford, who published an [essay for STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/) headlined \"A Fiasco in the Making?** As the Coronavirus Pandemic Takes Hold, We Are Making Decisions Without Reliable Data.\" While a short-term lockdown made sense, he argued, an extended lockdown could prove worse than the disease, and scientists needed to do more intensive testing to determine the risk. **The article offered common-sense advice from one of the world's most frequently cited authorities on the credibility of medical research, but it provoked", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:1:1645f9348af7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10716, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "epidemiologist at Stanford, who published an [essay for STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/) headlined \"A Fiasco in the Making?** As the Coronavirus Pandemic Takes Hold, We Are Making Decisions Without Reliable Data.\" While a short-term lockdown made sense, he argued, an extended lockdown could prove worse than the disease, and scientists needed to do more intensive testing to determine the risk. **The article offered common-sense advice from one of the world's most frequently cited authorities on the credibility of medical research, but it provoked a furious backlash on Twitter from scientists and journalists.** The fury intensified in April 2020, when Ioannidis followed his own advice by joining with Jay Bhattacharya and other colleagues from Stanford to gauge the spread of Covid in the surrounding area, Santa Clara County. After testing for Covid antibodies in the blood of several thousand volunteers, they estimated that the fatality rate among the infected in the county was about 0.2 percent, twice as high as for the flu but considerably lower than the assumptions of public-health officials and computer modelers. The researchers acknowledged that the fatality rate could be substantially higher in other places where the virus spread extensively in nursing homes (which hadn't yet occurred in the Santa Clara area). But **merely by reporting data that didn't fit the official panic narrative, they became targets**. Other scientists lambasted the researchers and claimed that methodological weaknesses in the study made the results meaningless. A statistician at Columbia wrote that the researchers \"owe us all an apology.\" A biologist at the University of North Carolina said that the study was \"horrible science.\" A Rutgers chemist called Ioannidis a \"mediocrity\" who \"cannot even formulate a simulacrum of a coherent, rational argument.\" A year later, Ioannidis still marvels at the attacks on the study (which was [eventually published](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/50/2/410/6146069) in a leading epidemiology journal). \"Scientists whom I respect started acting like warriors who had to subvert the enemy,\" he says. \"Every paper I've written has errors-I'm a scientist, not the pope-but the main conclusions of this one were correct and have withstood the criticism.\" Mainstream journalists piled on with hit pieces quoting critics and accusing the researchers of endangering lives by questioning lockdowns. *The Nation* called the research a \"black mark\" for Stanford. The cheapest shots came from BuzzFeed, which devoted thousands of words to a series of trivial objections and baseless accusations. The article that got the most attention was BuzzFeed's breathless [revelation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/stanford-coronavirus-neeleman-ioannidis-whistleblower) that an airline executive opposed to lockdowns had contributed $5,000-yes, five *thousand *dollars!-to an anonymized fund at Stanford that had helped finance the Santa Clara fieldwork. The notion that a team of prominent academics, who were not paid for their work in the study, would risk their reputations by skewing results for the sake of a $5,000 donation was absurd on its face-and even more ludicrous, given that Ioannidis, Bhattacharya, and the lead investigator, Eran Bendavid, said that they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:2:00cf4d0ad293", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10717, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "[revelation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/stanford-coronavirus-neeleman-ioannidis-whistleblower) that an airline executive opposed to lockdowns had contributed $5,000-yes, five *thousand *dollars!-to an anonymized fund at Stanford that had helped finance the Santa Clara fieldwork. The notion that a team of prominent academics, who were not paid for their work in the study, would risk their reputations by skewing results for the sake of a $5,000 donation was absurd on its face-and even more ludicrous, given that Ioannidis, Bhattacharya, and the lead investigator, Eran Bendavid, said that they weren't even aware of the donation while conducting the study. But **Stanford University was so cowed by the online uproar that it subjected the researchers to a two-month fact-finding inquiry by an outside legal firm. The inquiry found no evidence of conflict of interest, but the smear campaign succeeded in sending a clear message to scientists everywhere: Don't question the lockdown narrative.** In a brief interlude of journalistic competence, two veteran science writers, Jeanne Lenzer and Shannon Brownlee, published an [article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-covid-science-wars1/) in *Scientific American* decrying the politicization of Covid research. They defended the integrity and methodology of the Stanford researchers, noting that some subsequent studies had found similar rates of fatality among the infected. (In his latest [review of the literature](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eci.13554), Ioannidis now estimates that the average fatality rate in Europe and the Americas is 0.3 to 0.4 percent and about 0.2 percent among people not living in institutions.) Lenzer and Brownlee lamented that the unjust criticism and ad hominem vitriol had suppressed a legitimate debate by intimidating the scientific community. Their editors then proceeded to prove their point. Responding to more online fury, ***Scientific American* repented by publishing an [editor's note](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ioannidis-affair-a-tale-of-major-scientific-overreaction/) that essentially repudiated its own article. The editors printed BuzzFeed's accusations as the final word on the matter, refusing to publish a [rebuttal](https://jeannelenzer.com/scientific-american-scandal) from the article's authors or a supporting letter from Jeffrey Flier, former dean of Harvard Medical School. *Scientific American*, long the most venerable publication in its field, now bowed to the scientific authority of BuzzFeed.** Editors of research journals fell into line, too. **When Thomas Benfield, one of the researchers in Denmark conducting the first large randomized controlled trial of mask efficacy against Covid, was asked why they were taking so long to publish the much-anticipated findings, he promised them as \"as soon as a journal is brave enough to accept the paper.\" ** After being [rejected](https://www.berlingske.dk/videnskab/professor-stort-dansk-maskestudie-afvist-af-tre-top-tidsskrifter) by *The* *Lancet*, *The* *New England Journal of Medicine*, and *JAMA*, the study finally [appeared](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817) in the *Annals of Internal Medicine*, and the reason for the editors' reluctance became clear:** the study showed that a mask did not protect the wearer,** which contradicted claims by the Centers for Disease Control and other health authorities. **Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins with 350 publications to his name, submitted a critique of lockdowns to more than ten journals and finally gave up-the \"first time in my career that I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:3:9bd1d1492615", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10718, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Medicine*, and *JAMA*, the study finally [appeared](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817) in the *Annals of Internal Medicine*, and the reason for the editors' reluctance became clear:** the study showed that a mask did not protect the wearer,** which contradicted claims by the Centers for Disease Control and other health authorities. **Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins with 350 publications to his name, submitted a critique of lockdowns to more than ten journals and finally gave up-the \"first time in my career that I could not get a piece placed anywhere,\" he said. ** Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist at Harvard, had a similar experience with his article, early in the pandemic, arguing that resources should be focused on protecting the elderly. \"Just as in war,\" Kulldorff wrote, \"we must exploit the characteristics of the enemy in order to defeat it with the minimum number of casualties. Since Covid-19 operates in a highly age specific manner, mandated counter measures must also be age specific. If not, lives will be unnecessarily lost.\" It was a tragically accurate prophecy from one of the leading experts on infectious disease, but Kulldorff couldn't find a scientific journal or media outlet to accept the article, so he ended up [posting it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-counter-measures-should-age-specific-martin-kulldorff/) on his own LinkedIn page. **\"There's always a certain amount of herd thinking in science,\" Kulldorff says, \"but I've never seen it reach this level. Most of the epidemiologists and other scientists I've spoken to in private are against lockdowns, but they're afraid to speak up.\"** **To break the silence, Kulldorff joined with Stanford's Bhattacharya and Sunetra Gupta of Oxford to issue a plea for \"focused protection,\" called the [Great Barrington Declaration](https://gbdeclaration.org/).** They urged officials to divert more resources to shield the elderly, such as doing more tests of the staff at nursing homes and hospitals, while reopening business and schools for younger people, which would ultimately protect the vulnerable as herd immunity grew among the low-risk population. They managed to attract attention but not the kind they hoped for. **Though tens of thousands of other scientists and doctors went on to sign the declaration, the press caricatured it as a deadly \"let it rip\" strategy and an \"ethical nightmare\" from \"Covid deniers\" and \"agents of misinformation.\" Google initially [shadow-banned](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-cant-we-talk-about-the-great-barrington-declaration) it **so that the first page of search results for \"Great Barrington Declaration\" showed only criticism of it (like an article calling it \"the work of a climate denial network\") but not the declaration itself.

The Stanford faculty senate overwhelmingly [voted](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/11/20/faculty-senate-condemns-actions-hoover-fellow-scott-atlas/) to condemn Atlas's actions as \"anathema to our community, our values and our belief that we should use knowledge for good.\" Several professors from Stanford's medical school [demanded](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2776293?guestAccessKey=77eb5356-69c2-463e-92fc-58d64f69dcda&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=020421) further punishment in a *JAMA* article, \"When Physicians Engage in Practices That Threaten the Nation's Health.\" The article, which [misrepresented](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/02/atlas-mugged/)Atlas's views as well as the evidence on the efficacy of lockdowns, urged professional medical societies and medical-licensing boards to take action against Atlas on the grounds that it was \"ethically inappropriate for physicians to publicly recommend behaviors or interventions that are not scientifically well grounded.\" **But if it was unethical to recommend \"interventions that are not scientifically well grounded,\" how could anyone condone the lockdowns?** \"It was utterly immoral to conduct this society-wide intervention without the evidence to justify it,\" Bhattacharya says. \"The immediate results have been disastrous, especially for the poor, and the long-term effect will be to fundamentally undermine trust in public health and science.\" The traditional strategy for dealing with pandemics was to isolate the infected and protect the most vulnerable, just as Atlas and the Great Barrington scientists recommended. The CDC's pre-pandemic [planning scenarios](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm) didn't recommend extended school closures or any shutdown of businesses even during a plague as deadly as the 1918 Spanish flu. Yet Fauci [dismissed](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=73623859&cid=social_twitter_abcn#73627869)the focused-protection strategy as \"total nonsense\" to \"anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases,\" and his verdict became \"the science\" to leaders in America and elsewhere. Fortunately, a few leaders followed the science in a different way. Instead of blindly trusting Fauci, they listened to his critics and adopted the focused-protection strategy-most notably, in Florida. Its governor, Ron DeSantis, began to doubt the public-health establishment early in the pandemic, when computer models projected that Covid patients would greatly outnumber hospital beds in many states. Governors in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan were so alarmed and so determined to free up hospital beds that they directed nursing homes and other facilities to admit or readmit Covid patients-with deadly results. But DeSantis was skeptical of the hospital projections-for good reason, as [no state](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-americas-hospitals-survived-the-first-wave-of-the-coronavirus?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20Daily%20Health%20Policy%20Report&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=89534068&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ScZ5cfM_EdBiyP4jwWFycBvCn8JtmInnkxl0EQRlG5qsZADhpXleMqNI__2mSgqtsmLu3tSFHb1xe9BYu1uHhcdo3IA&utm_content=89534068&utm_source=hs_email) actually ran out of beds-and more worried about", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:5:1180054178d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10720, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "doubt the public-health establishment early in the pandemic, when computer models projected that Covid patients would greatly outnumber hospital beds in many states.

He forbade long-term-care centers to admit anyone infected with Covid and ordered frequent testing of the staff at senior-care centers. After locking down last spring, he reopened businesses, schools, and restaurants early, rejected mask mandates, and ignored protests from the press and the state's Democratic leaders. Fauci [warned](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/518577-fauci-says-new-coronavirus-actions-by-florida) that Florida was \"asking for trouble,\" but DeSantis went on seeking and heeding advice from Atlas and the Great Barrington scientists, who were astonished to speak with a politician already familiar with just about every study they mentioned to him. \"DeSantis was an incredible outlier,\" Atlas says. \"He dug up the data and read the scientific papers and analyzed it all himself. In our discussions, he'd bounce ideas off me, but he was already on top of the details of everything. He always had the perspective to see the larger harms of lockdowns and the need to concentrate testing and other resources on the elderly. And he has been proven correct.\" **If Florida had simply done no worse than the rest of the country during the pandemic, that would have been enough to discredit the lockdown strategy.** The state effectively served as the control group in a natural experiment, and no medical treatment with dangerous side effects would be approved if the control group fared no differently from the treatment group. But the outcome of this experiment was even more damning. **Florida's mortality rate from Covid is lower than the national average among those over 65 and also among younger people, so that the state's age-adjusted Covid [mortality rate](https://alachuachronicle.com/yes-the-covid-mortality-rate-is-higher-in-california-than-florida/) is lower than that of all but ten other states. ** **And by the most important measure, the overall rate of \"[excess mortality](https://www.usmortality.com/excess)\" (the number of deaths above normal), Florida has also done better than the national average. Its rate of excess mortality is significantly lower than that of the most restrictive state, California, particularly among younger adults, many of whom died not from Covid but from causes related to the lockdowns: cancer screenings and treatments were delayed, and there were sharp increases in deaths from drug overdoses and from heart attacks not treated promptly.** If the treatment group in a clinical trial were dying off faster than the control group, an ethical researcher would halt the experiment. But the lockdown proponents were undeterred by the numbers in Florida, or by [similar results](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) elsewhere, including", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:6:27aa41ca8f67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10721, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "among younger adults, many of whom died not from Covid but from causes related to the lockdowns: cancer screenings and treatments were delayed, and there were sharp increases in deaths from drug overdoses and from heart attacks not treated promptly.** If the treatment group in a clinical trial were dying off faster than the control group, an ethical researcher would halt the experiment. But the lockdown proponents were undeterred by the numbers in Florida, or by [similar results](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) elsewhere, including a comparable natural experiment involving European countries with the least restrictive policies. Sweden, Finland, and Norway rejected mask mandates and extended lockdowns, and they have each [suffered significantly less](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker) excess mortality than most other European countries during the pandemic. **A nationwide analysis in Sweden [showed](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/9/e2020834118) that keeping schools open throughout the pandemic, without masks or social distancing, had little effect on the spread of Covid,** but school closures and mask mandates for students continued elsewhere. Another Swedish researcher, Jonas Ludvigsson, [reported](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2026670) that **not a single schoolchild in the country died from Covid in Sweden and that their teachers' risk of serious illness was lower than for the rest of the workforce**-but these findings provoked so many online attacks and threats that Ludvigsson [decided to stop researching](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n489) or discussing Covid. Social-media platforms continued censoring scientists and journalists who questioned lockdowns and mask mandates. YouTube [removed](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/state/2021/04/12/governor-ron-desantis-blasts-youtube-over-coronavirus-video/7187306002/) a video discussion between DeSantis and the Great Barrington scientists, on the grounds that it \"contradicts the consensus\" on the efficacy of masks, and also [took down](https://www.aier.org/article/youtube-censors-white-house-health-advisor/) the Hoover Institution's interview with Atlas. Twitter locked out Atlas and Kulldorff for scientifically accurate challenges to mask orthodoxy. A peer-reviewed [German study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00112-021-01133-9) reporting harms to children from mask-wearing was suppressed on Facebook (which [labeled](https://www.city-journal.org/facebook-and-its-fact-checkers-spread-misinformation) my *City Journal* [article](https://www.city-journal.org/masking-children-unnecessary-and-harmful) \"Partly False\" because it cited the study) and also at ResearchGate, one of the most widely used websites for scientists to post their papers. ResearchGate refused to explain the censorship to the German scientists, telling them only that the paper was removed from the website in response to \"reports from the community about the subject-matter.\" The social-media censors and scientific establishment, aided by the Chinese government, succeeded for a year in suppressing the lab-leak theory, depriving vaccine developers of potentially valuable insights into the virus's evolution. It's understandable, if deplorable, that the researchers and officials involved in supporting the Wuhan lab research would cover up the possibility that they'd unleashed a Frankenstein on the world. What's harder to explain is why journalists and the rest of the scientific community so eagerly bought that story, along with the rest of the Covid narrative. Why the elite panic?

He had espoused the theory, so they assumed it must be wrong. And since he disagreed at times with Fauci about the danger of the virus and the need for lockdowns, then Fauci must be right, and this was such a deadly plague that the norms of journalism and science must be suspended. Millions would die unless Fauci was obeyed and dissenters were silenced. But neither the plague nor Trump explains the panic. **Yes, the virus was deadly, and Trump's erratic pronouncements contributed to the confusion and partisanship, but the panic was due to two preexisting pathologies that afflicted other countries, too. The first is what I have [called](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313665/the-power-of-bad-by-john-tierney-and-roy-f-baumeister/) the Crisis Crisis, the incessant state of alarm fomented by journalists and politicians.** It's a longstanding problem-humanity was supposedly doomed in the last century by the \"population crisis\" and the \"energy crisis\"-that has dramatically worsened with the cable and digital competition for ratings, clicks, and retweets. To keep audiences frightened around the clock, journalists seek out Cassandras with their own incentives for fearmongering: politicians, bureaucrats, activists, academics, and assorted experts who gain publicity, prestige, funding, and power during a crisis. **Unlike many proclaimed crises, an epidemic is a genuine threat, but the crisis industry can't resist exaggerating the danger, and doomsaying is rarely penalized. Early in the 1980s AIDS epidemic, the *New York Times* reported the [terrifying possibility](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/06/us/family-contact-studied-in-transmitting-aids.html) that the virus could spread to children through \"routine close contact\"-quoting from a study by Anthony Fauci. ** ***Life* magazine wildly exaggerated the number of infections in a [cover story](https://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2005/06/life-july-1985-now-no-one-is-safe-from.html), headlined \"Now No One Is Safe from AIDS.\" It cited a study by Robert Redfield, the future leader of the CDC during the Covid pandemic, [predicting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/04/17/heterosexual-aids-risk-studied/542d14b3-8868-494f-baf5-40bf428c51ca/) that AIDS would soon spread as rapidly among heterosexuals as among homosexuals. Both scientists were absolutely wrong, of course, but the false alarms didn't harm their careers or their credibility.** Journalists and politicians extend professional courtesy to fellow crisis-mongers by ignoring their mistakes, such as the previous [predictions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/neil-ferguson-scientist-convinced-boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised/) by Neil Ferguson. His team at Imperial College [projected](https://lockdownsceptics.org/the-imperial-model-and-its-role-in-the-uks-pandemic-response/) up to 65,000 deaths in the United Kingdom from swine flu and 200 million deaths worldwide from bird flu. The death toll each time was in the hundreds, but never mind: when Ferguson's team projected millions of American deaths from Covid, that was considered reason enough to follow its recommendation for extended lockdowns. And when the modelers' assumption about the fatality rate proved too high, that mistake was ignored, too. **Journalists", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:8:b04545036394", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10723, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "by Neil Ferguson.

And when the modelers' assumption about the fatality rate proved too high, that mistake was ignored, too. **Journalists kept highlighting the most alarming warnings, presented without context. They needed to keep their audience scared, and they succeeded.** For Americans under 70, the probability of surviving a Covid infection was about [99.9 percent](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892.pdf), but fear of the virus [was higher](https://fee.org/articles/why-young-adults-are-the-most-frightened-of-covid-even-though-they-are-the-least-at-risk/) among the young than among the elderly, and polls showed that people of all ages vastly [overestimated](https://fee.org/articles/americans-are-wildly-misinformed-about-the-risk-of-hospitalization-from-covid-19-survey-shows-here-s-why/) the risk of being hospitalized or dying. **The second pathology underlying the elite's Covid panic is the politicization of research**-what I have termed the [Left's war on science](https://www.city-journal.org/html/real-war-science-14782.html), another long-standing problem that has gotten much worse. Just as the progressives a century ago yearned for a nation directed by \"expert social engineers\"-scientific high priests unconstrained by voters and public opinion-today's progressives want sweeping new powers for politicians and bureaucrats who \"believe in science,\" meaning that they use the Left's version of science to justify their edicts. Now that so many elite institutions are political monocultures, progressives have more power than ever to enforce groupthink and suppress debate. Well before the pandemic, they had mastered the tactics for demonizing and silencing scientists whose findings challenged progressive orthodoxy on issues such as IQ, sex differences, race, family structure, transgenderism, and climate change. \"The less educated lost jobs so that professionals at minimal risk could feel safer as they kept working at home on their laptops.\" And then along came Covid-\"God's gift to the Left,\" in Jane Fonda's words. Exaggerating the danger and deflecting blame from China to Trump offered not only short-term political benefits, damaging his reelection prospects, but also an extraordinary opportunity to empower social engineers in Washington and state capitals. Early in the pandemic, Fauci [expressed doubt](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-hnk-intl-01-24-20/index.html) that it was politically possible to lock down American cities, but he underestimated the effectiveness of the crisis industry's scaremongering. **Americans were so frightened that they surrendered their freedoms to work, study, worship, dine, play, socialize, or even leave their homes. Progressives celebrated this \"paradigm shift,\" calling it a \"blueprint\" for dealing with climate change.** This experience should be a lesson in what not to do, and whom not to trust. Do not assume that the media's version of a crisis resembles reality. Do not count on mainstream journalists and their favorite doomsayers to put risks in perspective. Do not expect those who follow \"the science\" to know what they're talking about. **Science is a process of discovery and debate, not a faith to profess", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt:9:aad53a4b7304", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10724, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-pandemic-panic", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "shift,\" calling it a \"blueprint\" for dealing with climate change.** This experience should be a lesson in what not to do, and whom not to trust.

Do not expect those who follow \"the science\" to know what they're talking about. **Science is a process of discovery and debate, not a faith to profess or a dogma to live by. **It provides a description of the world, not a prescription for public policy, and specialists in one discipline do not have the knowledge or perspective to guide society. They're biased by their own narrow focus and self-interest. Fauci and Deborah Birx, the physician who allied with him against Atlas on the White House task force, had to answer for the daily Covid death toll-that ever-present chyron at the bottom of the television screen-so they focused on one disease instead of the collateral damage of their panic-driven policies. \"The Fauci-Birx lockdowns were a sinful, unconscionable, heinous mistake, and they will never admit they were wrong,\" Atlas says. Neither will the journalists and politicians who panicked along with them. **They're still portraying lockdowns as not just a success but also a precedent-proof that Americans can sacrifice for the common good when directed by wise scientists and benevolent autocrats. But the sacrifice did far more harm than good, and the burden was not shared equally. ** **The brunt was borne by the most vulnerable in America and the poorest countries of the world.** Students from disadvantaged families suffered the most from school closures, and children everywhere spent a year wearing masks solely to assuage the neurotic fears of adults. The less educated lost jobs so that professionals at minimal risk could feel safer as they kept working at home on their laptops. **Silicon Valley (and its censors) prospered from lockdowns that bankrupted local businesses.** Luminaries united on Zoom and YouTube to assure the public that \"we're all in this together.\" But we weren't. When the panic infected the nation's elite-the modern gentry who profess such concern for the downtrodden-it turned out that they weren't so different from aristocrats of the past. They were in it for themselves. *[John Tierney](https://www.city-journal.org/contributor/john-tierney_912) is a contributing editor of *City Journal*, a [contributing science columnist](https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-tierney) for the *New York Times*, and coauthor of *[The Power of Bad: How the Negativity Effect Rules Us and How We Can Rule It](https://amzn.to/3e2HYsl). **Note:** The original of this article can be found on [this webpage](https://www.city-journal.org/panic-pandemic).

Oxfam typically releases a report on global inequality at the start of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. That event usually sees thousands of corporate and political leaders, celebrities, campaigners, economists and journalists gather in the Swiss ski resort for panel discussions, drinks parties and schmoozing. However for the second year running, the meeting (scheduled for this week) will be online-only after the emergence of the Omicron variant derailed plans to return to an in-person event. Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB's chief executive, said the charity timed the report each year to coincide with Davos to attract the attention of economic, business and political elites. \"This year, what's happening is off the scale,\" he said. **\"There's been a new billionaire created almost every day during this pandemic, meanwhile 99% of the world's population are worse off because of lockdowns, lower international trade, less international tourism, and as a result of that, 160 million more people have been pushed into poverty.\"** \"Something is deeply flawed with our economic system,\" he added. **Note:**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news.txt:0:14a9bc4854d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10727, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to coincide with Davos to attract the attention of economic, business and political elites. \"This year, what's happening is off the scale,\" he said. **\"There's been a new billionaire created almost every day during this pandemic, meanwhile 99% of the world's population are worse off because of lockdowns, lower international trade, less international tourism, and as a result of that, 160 million more people have been pushed into poverty.\"** \"Something is deeply flawed with our economic system,\" he added. **Note:** BBC sadly fails to mention **it is not the pandemic that has caused all of this, but the lockdowns.** 21,000 a day, which is one million every 50 days, died as a result of the lockdowns. 160 million humans fell into poverty a result of these lockdowns, not to mention the huge increase in suicides, murders, domestic abuse, shuttered small businesses, and more.

But, for researchers who were testing Pfizer's vaccine at several sites in Texas during that autumn, speed may have come at the cost of data integrity and patient safety. A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told *The BMJ* that **the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events** reported in Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. **After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. **Jackson has provided *The BMJ* with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. Jackson has told *The BMJ* that, during the two weeks she was employed at Ventavia in September 2020, she repeatedly informed her superiors of poor laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. **Note:** Yet every major media proudly announces \"[brought to you by Pfizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=hlARrmWhHXo).\" Learn about [Brianne Dressen, Ph.D](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-defender-brianne-dressen-media-censoring-vaccine-injury-stories/)., a volunteer for early COVID vaccines clinical trials who ended up with serious adverse effects the evening of the shot and was later hospitalized, yet then the study", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news.txt:1:9df0da162ac3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10728, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-questions-in-news", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "emails.

They were from a Dec. 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19**. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory. Dr. Kory is part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives. At the December hearing, he presented evidence regarding the use of ivermectin, a cheap and widely available drug that treats tropical diseases caused by parasites, for prevention and early treatment of Covid-19. He described a just-published study from Argentina in which **about 800 health-care workers received ivermectin and 400 didn't. Not one of the 800 contracted Covid-19; 58% of the 400 did. **Before being removed from YouTube and other websites, Dr. Kory's opening statement had been viewed by more than eight million people. Unfortunately, government health agencies don't share that interest in early treatment. A year into the pandemic, NIH treatment guidelines for Covid patients are to go home, isolate yourself and do nothing other than monitor your illness. The censors at YouTube have decided for all of us that the American public shouldn't be able to hear what senators heard. **Note:** You can access the entire article free of charge on [this webpage](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2021/2/youtube-cancels-the-u-s-senat). **Can it be any more blatant that facebook is in cahoots with big Pharma in not wanting cheap, effective treatments for COVID-19? **Watch an excellent, eye-opening [14-minute interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UzFTAeEzJ8) with a facebook insider revealing how censorship works.

That particular FDA doctor was referring to two recent developments inside the agency. **First, how, with no solid clinical data, the agency authorized COVID [vaccines for infants and toddlers](https://nypost.com/2022/07/09/few-toddlers-getting-covid-19-vax-in-the-big-apple/), including those who already had COVID. And second, [how] the FDA bypassed its external experts to authorize booster shots for young children**. That doctor is hardly alone. At the NIH, doctors and scientists complain to us about low morale and lower staffing: The NIH's Vaccine Research Center has had many of its senior scientists leave over the last year, including the director, deputy director and chief medical officer. The CDC has experienced a similar exodus. \"There's been a large amount of turnover. Morale is low,\" one high level official at the CDC told us. **\"Things have become so political, so what are we there for?\"** Another CDC scientist told us: \"I used to be proud to tell people I work at the CDC. Now I'm embarrassed.\" Why are they embarrassed? First, they demanded that young children be [masked in schools](https://nypost.com/2021/10/20/cdc-says-keep-school-mask-mandates-as-kids-get-covid-vaccine/). On this score, the agencies were wrong. Compelling studies later found schools that masked children had no different rates of transmission. Next came [school closures](https://nypost.com/2021/12/17/nyc-shuts-down-three-schools-in-one-day-over-new-covid-cases/). The agencies were wrong - and catastrophically so. Poor and minority children suffered learning loss with an 11-point drop in math scores alone and a 20% drop in math pass rates. Then they ignored natural immunity.

The country has so far resisted going into lockdown, unlike the rest of Europe, even during the peak of its second wave over Christmas. Sweden may be faring comparably better in terms of excess deaths - those greater than the usual number of deaths expected in a certain time period. Experts say excess deaths can indicate whether policies intended to combat the pandemic have unintended consequences, such as delaying treatment for other ailments and is an important measure of the overall efficacy of policy. While still performing worse than other Nordic countries on [data from Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20210216-2), the official European Union statistics agency, and the University of Oxford, shows that **Sweden recorded 7.9% excess deaths last year compared to the years 2016-19, according to the independent health news site Dagens Medicin. That means that the country had the 23rd lowest annual excess deaths out of 30 European countries - lower than the U.K. (15.1%), France (10.4%) and Spain (18.9%)**.

On Sunday, **Dr Nabarro appealed to world leaders to stop \"using lockdowns as your primary control method\", insisting that such drastic measures can have a dire impact on global poverty rates**. **The British doctor stated: \"We in the World Health Organisation do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus.** The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganise, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we'd rather not do it.\" Dr Nabarro went on to say that developing economies had been indirectly affected by lockdown measures, adding: \"Look what's happened to smallholder farmers all over the world -- look what's happening to poverty levels. \"It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year.

Further, more than 550,000 additional children each month are being struck by what is called wasting,** according to the U.N. - malnutrition that manifests in spindly limbs and distended bellies. Over a year, that's up 6.7 million from last year's total of 47 million. Wasting and stunting can permanently damage children physically and mentally, transforming individual tragedies into a generational catastrophe.

This is a scandal so overwhelming that there is only one good place to start: the evidence as it stands**. In accordance with pro-lockdown theory, if stay at home orders worked, you might have expected to see daily deaths spike 3-4 weeks after such measures were implemented.

When that study concluded, a Pfizer spokesperson [said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-says-covid-19-booster-sparked-immune-response-against-omicron-in-children-ages-5-to-11-11649933284) it did not determine the efficacy of the booster in the 5-to-11-year-olds. But that didn't matter to the CDC**. Seemingly hoping for a different answer, the agency put the matter before its own kangaroo court of curated experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Committee members ... emphasized the importance of a universal booster message that applies to all age groups. Most remarkably, it didn't seem to matter to the CDC that 75.2 percent of children under age 11 already have natural immunity, according to a [CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7117e3.htm?s_cid=mm7117e3_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM80513&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2071%2C%20April%2026%2C%202022&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM80513). Natural immunity is certainly much more prevalent today, given the ubiquity of the Omicron variant since February. CDC data from New York and California demonstrated that natural immunity was 2.8 times more effective in preventing hospitalization and 3.3 to 4.7 times more effective in preventing COVID infection compared to vaccination during the Delta wave. These findings are consistent with dozens of other clinical studies. Yet natural immunity has consistently and inexplicably been dismissed by the medical establishment. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on coronavirus vaccines](https://www.wanttoknow.info/coronavirus-vaccine-problemsnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **The Sweden experiment: how no lockdowns led to better mental health, a healthier economy and happier schoolchildren** **2021-08-22, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/08/22/sweden-experiment-no-lockdo...](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/08/22/sweden-experiment-no-lockdowns-led-better-mental-health-healthier/) Sweden's decision to eschew lockdown and leave pubs, restaurants, shopping centres and primary schools open throughout the pandemic generated furious discussion internationally.

That is not to say the virus has not taken its toll - nearly 15,000 people have died in total, around 1,450 per million. But that death rate is lower than the average for the European Union as a whole (1,684), and well below those of France, Spain, Italy and the UK. Some now concede Sweden has not become the cautionary tale many predicted. \"Many times I would have thought that the situation would have gone a different way, but it worked for Sweden,\" said Samir Bhatt, professor of Public Health at the University of Copenhagen, and one of the team at Imperial College who pushed the UK's lockdown strategy. **\"They achieved infection control; they managed to keep infections relatively low and they didn't have any health care collapse.\" The real benefits of Sweden's radical policy, however, can be seen in the economy, the psychological impact, and in schools. In the end, GDP shrank by just 2.8 per cent, significantly lower than the EU average of 6 per cent**. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on the coronavirus](https://www.wanttoknow.info/coronavirusnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **Massive 1-Year Rise In Homicide Rates Collided With The Pandemic In 2020** **2021-01-06, NPR** [https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953254623/massive-1-year-rise-in-homicide-rate...](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953254623/massive-1-year-rise-in-homicide-rates-collided-with-the-pandemic-in-2020) At the end of 2020, Chicago police reported more than 750 murders, a jump of more than 50% compared with 2019. By mid-December, Los Angeles saw a 30% increase over the previous year with 322 homicides. There were 437 homicides in New York City by Dec. 20, nearly 40% more than the previous year. New Orleans-based data consultant Jeff Asher studied crime rates in more than 50 cities and says the crime spikes aren't just happening in big cities. With the numbers of homicides spiking in many places, Asher expects the final statistics for 2020 to tell a startlingly grim story. **\"We're going to see, historically, the largest one-year rise in murder that we've ever seen,\" he says. Asher says it has been more than a half-century since the country saw a year-to-year murder rate that jumped nearly 13%**. \"We have good data that the rise in murder picked up in the early stages of the summer,\" Asher says, \"and we also have good data that the rise of murder picked up again in September and October as some of the financial assistance started to wear off.\" Chicago minister the Rev.

They've watched helplessly as their meager savings dwindled away, as they were confined to their homes-prohibited from interacting with friends, attending church, temple or music and sporting events due to restrictions enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This resulted in a profound impact on the mental health and emotional well-being of people-leading to a significant increase in cases of anxiety, depression and deaths by suicide. The CDC conducted a survey of 5,412 people between June 24 and 30 and the collected data on suicides is alarming. **Roughly 25% percent of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 say they've [considered suicide](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/cdc-mental-health-pandemic-394832) because of the pandemic**. About 30.9% of the respondents said that they \"had symptoms of anxiety or depression\" and about 26.3% reported trauma and stress-related disorders caused by the outbreak. Over 13% said that they have used alcohol, prescription and/or illegal drugs to deal with their pandemic-induced stress and anxiety. The amount of Americans reporting anxiety symptoms is triple the number of this time last year.

The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. Dr. Fauci played an important role in promoting the work. In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses ... bringing the total to $7.4 million. [One] phase of the project [included] gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. According to Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University,** the project ... would enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells and laboratory animals using techniques of genetic engineering. ****SARS-CoV-2, the virus now causing a global pandemic, is believed to have originated in bats.

The seven-day average test positivity stands at 7.13%. In December, Massachusetts Department of Public Health officials [released a study](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-covid-breakthrough-case-study/2595320/) that found that 97% of breakthrough cases in the state did not become severely ill and rarely led to deaths, especially among young people. Massachusetts' COVID metrics, tracked on the Department of Public Health's interactive [coronavirus dashboard](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting), have been trending downward after spiking to heights not seen since previous surges, a peak thought to be driven at least in part by the omicron variant. **Note:** As of Jan. 31, 2022, Massachusetts had a total of 21,546 COVID deaths as reported above. Their first COVID death was on Mar. 20, 2020. So over the 97 weeks since the start of the pandemic, they averaged 222 deaths a week. Yet in the last week of January 2022, this NBC article reports 290 breakthrough deaths.

Little-known tech firm Genvis Pty Ltd said on a website for its software that New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, home to Sydney, Melbourne and more than half of Australia's 25 million population, were trialling its facial recognition products. The Perth, Western Australia-based startup developed the software in 2020 with WA state police to help enforce pandemic movement restrictions. South Australia state began trialling a similar, non-Genvis technology last month, sparking warnings from privacy advocates around the world about potential surveillance overreach. The involvement of New South Wales and Victoria, which have not disclosed that they are trialling facial recognition technology, may amplify those concerns. Under the system being trialled, **people respond to random check-in requests by taking a 'selfie' at their designated home quarantine address. If the software, which also collects location data, does not verify the image against a \"facial signature\", police may follow up with a visit to the location to confirm the person's whereabouts**. While the recognition technology has been used in countries like China, no other democracy has been reported as considering its use in connection with coronavirus containment procedures. **Note:** **On Sept. 21st, thousands of citizens took to the streets to protest policies like this in Melbourne alone, as shown in [this revealing video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=981896615987768). **The police are responding almost like they are at war, as show in [this video](https://www.facebook.com/ahmet.g.oruc/posts/10221967287945142).

Their Offense? Treating Covid Patients Early and Having Success The Imperial Valley is a place most Californians are only vaguely aware of. Many residents of the big coastal cities might be hard pressed to even find it on a map. It is a farming region tucked into the southeastern corner of the state, smack dab on the border with Mexico. And **in the early months of 2020, it turned into a Covid-19 hot zone. More cases, more hospitalizations, more deaths-adjusted for population-[than any other county in California](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/coronavirus/counties-with-the-highest-covid-19-death-rate-in-california/).** Enter two physicians, Dr. Brian Tyson and Dr. George Fareed, whose extraordinary success in treating Covid-19 patients in the early stages of their illness has generated [national](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU21eGO0ukg) and [international](https://www.thedesertreview.com/news/local/dr-fareed-addresses-italian-senate-at-covid-summit/article_75ef29c2-16ff-11ec-9560-1b32c7c0d4a0.html) attention-but also censorship, medical establishment scorn, and attacks on their reputation and [license](https://hopepressworks.org/f/the-miracle-of-the-imperial-valley-george-fareed) to practice medicine. **\"I've practiced ER and ICU medicine for many years,\" says Tyson, an urgent care physician who heads up [three urgent care clinics](https://allvalleyurgentcare.business.site/) in El Centro and two other cities in Imperial Valley. \"And never in my life did I expect to encounter such hostility. Never.\"** Twitter has [banned](https://covid19.onedaymd.com/2022/01/dr-george-fareed-and-dr-brian-tyson.html) him. YouTube has taken down videos posted by him and his colleague Fareed, a 77-year-old family medicine specialist and graduate of Harvard Medical School who has also taught at that university. (Not to be outdone, the two have reposted the videos.) When [Tyson spoke on the steps of the Supreme Court](https://www.thedesertreview.com/news/dr-brian-tyson-speaks-at-america-s-frontline-doctors-in-washington-dc/article_4bd9aae0-11fb-11eb-a470-dbd980aa27bd.html) in the fall of 2021 with a group of other physicians advocating for early Covid treatment, the video generated 200,000 views on Facebook.

That is their clinical track record.*** And of the seven who died under their care, all were very ill when they arrived at the clinics, and all of them only began to be treated in the second week after they contracted the virus. **\"When we start treatment before Day Seven, not a single patient of ours has died. Not a single one,\" says Tyson. \"Of those we lost, they all presented after Day Seven. It just shows how important it is to treat people early.\"** One of their Covid success stories was 106 years old. Another was a woman two months pregnant. Over the past two years a river of humanity-nursing home residents and their caregivers, migrant farmworkers, meat packing plant workers, prison guards, Border Patrol agents, teachers, doctors, nurses, sheriffs, hundreds of members of a local Baptist church-has poured into the clinic and outside in the parking lot where they set up tents to handle the overflow. All needed help, and all got it. This is why some have dubbed Tyson's and Fareed's work \"the miracle of Imperial Valley,\" although both men would concede it's not a miracle at all. It's a practical affirmation of an almost banal medical truism: catching a disease or illness early is the best way to fight it.** In the beginning of Covid they administered an early treatment protocol of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and antibiotics, the so-called \"HCQ cocktail.\" Since then they have added Ivermectin to the mix** and fine-tuned other elements based on what they have learned from their patients and the reports and experiences from other front-line physicians around the world. \"We would not accept there was no early outpatient treatment available,\" says Tyson. \"When people got sick they went to the hospital. Then they were told to go home and wait without being offered treatment. Then when they can't breathe anymore and they're in crisis, they'd come back to the hospital in a panic. To me it's absolutely criminal.\" He adds, not mincing his words: **\"This has been the biggest public health failure in the history of medicine. The decisions are not being made in the best interests of health, but in the best interests of power and money.\"** **The overall [mortality rate](https://medicalfreedom.substack.com/p/censorship-of-dr-brian-tyson?utm_source=url&s=r)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt:1:1303cfd85adf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10745, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "they were told to go home and wait without being offered treatment.

At his urgent care clinics where early treatment is the rule, the rate is .04 percent. **Some claim that the stark difference in the success rate is owing to the fact that they see healthier patients-a criticism Tyson dismisses. \"The argument that we're not taking care of the sickest patients like the hospital does, it's just not true. Same population, same demographics. We have no exclusion criteria whatsoever.\" From the height of the pandemic when they were seeing 300 patients a day, the clinics have seen a recent drop-off in Covid cases. \"Omicron burnt through the valley like a wildfire out here,\" he reports. Although the crisis may be backing off somewhat, for the moment, Tyson himself is not. Last month he announced his [candidacy](https://drbriantyson.com/) for the 25th District of the U.S. Congress to represent the Imperial Valley region in Washington. Tyson and his wife Fabiola, a nurse-practitioner, have seven children-two from his previous marriage, two from hers, and three they adopted together. One night while the two of them were watching TV she gave him a piece of advice that he took to heart. \"Stop yelling at the TV because they can't hear you,\" she told him. \"Do something about it or shut up.\" Tyson is doing something about it. And clearly, he is not going to stay quiet about it either. Dr. Tyson tending to a patient.

This was (and is) a stunning collection, widely read and reproduced on many websites. When you read it, you are astounded to learn that **all the U.S. (and many international) public health agencies took many different actions that led to increased deaths and destruction from COVID and prolonged the pandemic.** \"Avoiding the Trump drug\" served as a great cover story.

But they hushed it up.** Five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. scientists (employed by the U.S. government), along with three Canadian government scientists, in 2005 published a [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115318/) showing chloroquine was an effective drug against SARS coronaviruses. European scientists [showed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15351731/) the same thing in 2004. The CDC paper concluded: \"... chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-COV infection ... suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\" Chloroquine looked very promising for both prevention and treatment of the first SARS. After all, it has been used for many decades to prevent and treat malaria. (I took it for prevention, and later for treatment, 50 years ago). Nine years later, in 2014, scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - the agency run by [Dr. Anthony Tony Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) - published a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/) showing the same thing. Moreover, the NIAID study revealed that not only did chloroquine work in vitro against the MERS coronavirus, but dozens of existing drugs, which could have been tested in patients as soon as the pandemic started, were also effective against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. This is what the NIAID authors wrote: \"Here we found that 66 of the screened drugs were effective at inhibiting either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection in vitro and that 27 of these compounds were effective against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These data demonstrate the efficiency of screening approved or clinically developed drugs for identification of potential therapeutic options for emerging viral diseases, and also provide an expedited approach for supporting off-label use of approved therapeutics.\" Just in case you think these papers were flukes, two unrelated groups of European scientists found essentially the same thing. This [2014 European paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24841269/) was published back-to-back with the NIAID paper. I have cited the 2004 European [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15351731/) elsewhere, and these citations can also be found in Robert F.

This has to be investigated and justice obtained, to prevent such crimes from happening to patients ever again. The \"Why?\" and \"How could this be?!!\" requires people to take a huge leap, in order to understand the world we live in. Many people don't have the fortitude to dissect their worldview and rebuild it in accord with the facts that have spilled out over the last two years. But I am about to present some more facts that I hope you can assimilate into your understanding of the world. It might require a stiff drink, or perhaps some chocolate. Whatever it takes, read on. It might save your life or someone else's. **Ivermectin sales explode** [Ivermectin](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/preventive-ivermectin-reduced-covid-mortality/) was not identified in the studies I mentioned above as a potentially useful coronavirus drug. But some people knew it was likely to work in early 2020, because the French [MedinCell](https://www.medincell.com/en/) company, working with Monash University and supported by [Bill Gates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-the-real-anthony-fauci-bill-gates/), was developing an injectable version (which would be able to be patented). MedinCell issued a [press release](https://www.medincell.com/en/2020/04/06/medincell-has-launched-a-covid-19-research-initiative-based-on-its-experience-to-formulate-long-acting-injectable-ivermectin/) about this on April 6, 2020, and an [informational paper](https://invest.medincell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PR_MedinCell_Adapt-and-overcome-in-response-to-the-Covid19-crisis_EN.pdf) on April 23, 2020. There was a brief run on the veterinary drug at this time in the U.S., according to a [warning](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fda-letter-stakeholders-do-not-use-ivermectin-intended-animals-treatment-covid-19-humans) issued April 10, 2020, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), indicating some people knew it might be an effective COVID treatment and were acquiring veterinary versions. But there was not a lot of buzz and sales did not take off at that time.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) held a Senate hearing that was focused on ivermectin's benefits for COVID. Intensive care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory, originally a New Yorker, gave a particularly [compelling speech](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Kory-2020-12-08.pdf). People began paying attention to the drug. YouTube then removed Kory's speech - censoring a Senate hearing! I think the authorities were initially scared to repeat the same tricks with ivermectin they had used to beat down the chloroquine drugs. And because ivermectin has efficacy late in the disease as well as at the start, and is not toxic at several times the normal dose, some of the tricks used against chloroquine (giving it too late in the disease course or overdosing patients) simply would not work with ivermectin. The U.S. authorities kept quiet. South Africa was the trial balloon. On Christmas Eve 2020, South African authorities banned the importation of ivermectin. However, several local organizations mounted legal actions, and they won. Within several months ivermectin was back on the shelves. Thanks in great measure to the [Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance](https://covid19criticalcare.com/), ivermectin's popularity gradually began to explode. Then the CDC published a [report](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp) in late August 2021, showing ivermectin prescriptions had quadrupled in a month, and the drug was now selling at 25 times the pre-COVID rate. [Business Insider reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/ivermectin-prescriptions-surged-24-fold-unproven-coronavirus-cure-2021-8), \"More than 88,000 prescriptions for the drug were filled by pharmacies in the week ending August 13, the CDC said in a report published August 26.\" Apparently, this terrified the powers that be. What if the pandemic got wiped out with ivermectin? It worked too well! Would that be the end of [vaccine mandates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/states-challenge-vaccine-mandates-healthcare-workers/), [boosters](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/eu-regulators-who-end-covid-boosters/), [vaccine passports](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/corporate-vaccine-mandates-passports-blackrock-vanguard/) and digital IDs? The end of the [Great Reset](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/russell-brand-vandana-shiva-great-reset-bill-gates/)? **Targeting doctors** Something had to be done and fast. It had to be big. It had to be effective. Public health officials couldn't simply take the drug off the market - that would require a long process and would leave a paper trail. What to do? There was probably only one option: Scare the pants off doctors. Loss of license is the very worst thing you can do to a doctor. Threaten their licenses and they will immediately fall into line.

The Philippines Department of Health [tested](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1411421/doh-doctors-prescribing-ivermectin-as-covid-19-cure-risk-losing-license) the strategy. The powers that be could also scare the pharmacies. This required stealth - no paper trail. It required intimidation, backed by a one-two punch: actually suspending doctors' (and maybe pharmacists') licenses. You couple that with a huge media offensive, and threats from an industry of medical \"nonprofits.\" You invent \"misinformation\" as a medical misdemeanor, studiously failing to define it. You make people think the legal prescribing of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine is a crime, even though off-label prescribing is entirely legal under the [Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act). Did Fauci give the order? Was it CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky? Maybe it was acting FDA Commissioner [Dr. Janet Woodcock](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-pfizer-covid-kids-pharma/)? It was probably some combination, plus the public relations professionals managing the messaging and the media. **Here's what happened ... ** **1.** Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), along with several other senators, [introduced the \"Health Misinformation Act](https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-klobuchar-introduce-legislation-to-hold-digital-platforms-accountable-for-vaccine-and-other-health-related-misinformation/)\" in July 2021, because \"misinformation was putting lives at risk,\" Lujan said. A huge supporter of COVID vaccinations, the 49-year-old senator [suffered a stroke](https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-statement-on-hospitalization/) on Feb. 1. **2.** The pharmacies suddenly could not get ivermectin from their wholesalers. No reason was given except \"supply and demand.\" But it seemed the supply was cut off everywhere. Ivermectin was dribbled out by the wholesalers, a few pills a week per pharmacy, not enough to supply even one prescription weekly. Some powerful entity presumably ordered the wholesalers to make the drug (practically) unavailable - with no shortages announced. I called the main manufacturer in the U.S., Edenbridge, and was told they were producing plenty of ivermectin. Hydroxychloroquine had been restricted in a variety of ways, determined by each state, since early 2020. It had also been restricted by certain manufacturers and pharmacy chains in 2020. Suddenly, in September 2021, it became considerably harder than it already was to obtain. **3.** In late August 2021, the CDC sent out a [major warning](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp) about ivermectin but provided only two examples of anyone having a problem with the drug: One person overdosed on an animal version, and one overdosed on ivermectin bought on the internet. This should not have been news. However, pharmacists and doctors read between the lines and knew this was code for \"verboten.\" Almost all of them stopped dispensing ivermectin at that time.

It should be of interest to everyone that our health agencies now speak in coded messages to doctors and pharmacies, presumably to avoid putting their threats on paper and being accountable for them. What a way for government to do business. **4.** Also in August 2021, various \"nonprofit\" medical organizations started issuing warnings, in concert, regarding doctors prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, and spreading misinformation - especially about COVID vaccines. These organizations included the [Federation of State Medical Boards](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-misinformation-medical-license-u-s-boards-warn-physicians/) (FSMB), the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Pharmacists Association and several specialty boards. Here is an example of the [AMA's language](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/leadership/flow-damaging-covid-19-disinformation-must-end-now): \"A handful of doctors spreading disinformation have fostered belief in scientifically unvalidated and potentially dangerous \"cures\" for COVID-19 while increasing vaccine hesitancy ...\" These organizations told doctors they could lose their licenses or board certifications for such behaviors. Mind you, none of these so-called nonprofit organizations has any regulatory authority. Nor do I believe they have any authority to claw back a board certification. They were blowing smoke. And they were probably paid to do so. Who paid them? **5.** Over the course of three days at the end of August 2021, national media reported on four doctors in three states whose boards were investigating them for the use of ivermectin. Hawaii's Medical Board [went after](https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2021/08/board-files-complaints-against-maui-health-officer-physician/) Hawaii's chief medical officer: \"The Hawaii Medical Board has filed complaints against Maui's top health official and a Valley Isle physician following reports that they backed COVID-19 treatments that state and federal health agencies advise against.\" They really wanted to make an example by going after the state's chief medical officer, who had the guts to treat COVID patients. Clearly, the orders are coming from high up on the food chain. Here were some of the other August headlines I collected about doctors who legally prescribed a fully approved drug off-label: **6.** The FSMB is an organization that assists 71 state and territorial medical boards with policies, training, etc. Members pay dues and the organization accepts donations. FSMB has its own foundation, too. Its president [earns $777,255/year](https://nonprofitlight.com/tx/euless/federation-of-state-medical-boards-of-the-united-states-inc) - not bad for a backwater administrative job at an organization headquartered in Euless, Texas. After the FSMB instructed its members that misinformation was a crime, somewhere between eight and 15 of its member boards began to take action. ([Media](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/964643) have reported that eight, 12 or 15 boards of its 71-member boards did so, according to the FSMB, which is closely monitoring the results of its calumny.) **7.** On Feb. 7, 2022, the U.S. Department", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt:7:709a66da1edf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10751, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "too.

Mass casualty attacks and other acts of targeted violence conducted by lone offenders and small groups acting in furtherance of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances pose an ongoing threat to the nation.\" Thus it appears that misinformation and disinformation have been selected to play an important role in a newly developing narrative, as the pandemic restrictions and accompanying narratives become long in the tooth. **8.** I presume the majority of the 71 medical boards' attorneys knew something about the U.S. Constitution, knew that every American has an inalienable right to freedom of speech, and simply ignored the FSMB's exhortation to go after misinformation spreaders. The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine, however, went along. Three doctors in Maine, including me, recently had their licenses suspended or threatened for writing waivers for COVID vaccines, \"spreading misinformation\" and/or prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (all of which are legal activities for doctors). But boards have broad powers to intervene in the practice of medicine, and their members are shielded from liability as agents of the state. And so they went after a chronic Lyme doctor several years ago, who found, as expected, it would be too onerous to fight back, so he gave up his license. **9.** Here is what the Maine Board [claims](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article257335847.html) about me: \"The board noted that Ivermectin isn't Food and Drug Administration \"authorized or approved\" as a treatment for COVID-19 in the suspension order ... \"The board said that her continuing to practice as a physician 'constitutes an immediate jeopardy to the health and physical safety of the public who might receive her medical services, and that it is necessary to immediately suspend her ability to practice medicine in order to adequately respond to this risk.'\" I am 70 years old, and my medical practice was set up as a service so that everyone could access COVID drugs who wanted", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt:8:b8a231718ea5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10752, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "in the suspension order ... \"The board said that her continuing to practice as a physician 'constitutes an immediate jeopardy to the health and physical safety of the public who might receive her medical services, and that it is necessary to immediately suspend her ability to practice medicine in order to adequately respond to this risk.'\" I am 70 years old, and my medical practice was set up as a service so that everyone could access COVID drugs who wanted them. My fee was $60 per patient for all the COVID care they needed. I am sure the Maine Board had calculated that given all the above, I would not challenge the board's suspension and would simply surrender my license as it would probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight the board's actions in court. However, I was surprised to find that on the day my license was suspended, there was massive national publicity about my case. The story was on [The Associated Press wire](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-maine-misinformation-35903ae03fc023cf9b52ac089cd19aa3) and covered from the San Francisco Chronicle to the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article257335847.html). And for some reason, it was not behind the usual paywall. [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/589379-board-temporarily-suspends-license-of-doctor-accused-of-spreading-false), [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/doctors-medical-license-suspended-over-accusations-spreading-covid-misinformation-1668679), the Daily Beast and many other publications all ran hit pieces about me. I gathered that my situation was bigger than just a renegade Maine medical board: I had been selected to serve as an example to physicians nationwide who might be prescribing early treatment for COVID. Once I realized I was being used as a poster child in a national fear campaign designed to purge doctors who think independently, I decided to fight back. Fortunately, [Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/) is helping with my legal expenses, which is what allows me to mount a strong attack against the bulldozing of free speech, patient autonomy and choice, and the doctor-patient relationship. There is a lot riding on the outcome. https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/how-governments-suppressed-effective-covid-treatments/ **How NIH Got Forbes to Cancel Me After I Wrote About Fauci [Adam Andrzejewski](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/adam-andrzejewski/) March 10, 2022** *In January 2021, Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpenTheBooks.com, wrote a factual article about Dr. Anthony Fauci in which he pointed out that Fauci is the highest-paid U.S. government employee.

When I published our original reporting at Forbes, here is what happened. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fauci's employer, loaded an artillery shell in their big gun and fired it at the C-suite at Forbes. Quickly, Forbes folded and my column was terminated. **Background** At OpenTheBooks.com, we believe transparency revolutionizes U.S. public policy and politics. As a regular contributor to Forbes since May 2014, I [published](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/?sh=6434cf005f81) 206 investigations while writing an estimated quarter-million words on the platform. In May 2018, Forbes upgraded my title to senior policy contributor. Over this nearly eight-year period, my articles were a-political and used hard data to fact check Republicans, Democrats and unelected bureaucrats. Since 2019, I published 112 articles for 13,031,558 views - an average of 116,353 views per investigation. Here are three examples of our original reporting: The Biden Administration [left behind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/08/23/staggering-costs--us-military-equipment-left-behind-in-afghanistan/?sh=22f91e9a41db) up to 600,000 weapons, 75,000 military vehicles and 16,000-night vision devices in their hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. No, President Donald Trump [didn't drain the swamp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/09/27/the-federal-administrative-state-grew--even-under-president-donald-trump/?sh=a6a16a7688d9) - the swamp grew by 50,000 executive agency positions during his four years. In 2004, [Dr. Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) [received a permanent pay adjustment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/10/20/dr-anthony-faucis-little-known-biodefense-work--its-how-he-became-the-highest-paid-federal-employee/?sh=76e528f86081) for his biodefense work. In other words, Fauci was the top-paid federal employee precisely because he was paid to stop a pandemic. In 2020, I published 36 investigations at Forbes and the editors chose 26 for special showcase on the platform, a designation called \"Editors' Pick.\" The first [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/01/25/dr-anthony-fauci-the-highest-paid-employee-in-the-entire-us-federal-government/?sh=3d610378386f) I published in 2021 broke national news that Fauci was the [most highly compensated](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/anthony-fauci-highest-paid-federal-employee/) federal employee and even out-earned the president, four-star generals and 4.3 million colleagues. That piece alone has 900,000+ views. However, none of the 56 articles I published during 2021-2022 received an \"Editors' Pick\" designation. Something changed at Forbes after I wrote about [Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804). **Peak moment** The controversy surrounding Fauci's finances reached a fever pitch in January of this year, and my column at Forbes was right in the middle of it. In the Senate hearing on Jan. 11, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), cited my Forbes article in his [questioning of Fauci's salary and his financial disclosures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf84NrE81G0). First, Fauci claimed his financials were \"public knowledge,\" then, the hot mic caught the doctor calling the senator a \"moron.\" It was Fauci's code red moment and one of the top national news stories of the day. As reported by The Washington Post, when Fauci went back to NIH, he [admitted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/01/27/fauci-pandemic-threats/), \"Maybe the senator has a point. Maybe my financial investments, though disclosed and available, should be much easier to see.\" In fact, Fauci's financials were not available and I had firsthand", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt:10:778997f6409a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10754, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "claimed his financials were \"public knowledge,\" then, the hot mic caught the doctor calling the senator a \"moron.\" It was Fauci's code red moment and one of the top national news stories of the day.

Immediately, I published the evidence behind the lack of transparency at Forbes on Jan. 12: [No Fauci's Records Aren't Available. Why Won't NIH Immediately Release Them?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2022/01/12/no-faucis-records-arent-available-online-why-wont-nih-immediately-release-them/?sh=561f098646bd) During an entire year, NIH had refused to produce Fauci's job contract, job description, non-disclosure agreement, conflict of interest, financial disclosures, ethics agreements and royalties subject to our OpenTheBooks FOIA request. In October 2021, we [sued NIH with Judicial Watch](https://www.openthebooks.com/judicial-watch-sues-on-behalf-of-openthebookscom-for-fauci-financial-disclosure-records-and-royalties-paid-to-nih-employees/) and we still hadn't received the 1,200 pages promised by the agency. PolitiFact fact-checked Sen. Marshall and Fauci on their statements during the hearing, [Fauci said all you have to do is ask](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/13/fauci-said-all-you-have-do-ask-his-financial-discl/) for his financial disclosure. Yes, but it could take a while. PolitiFact cited my Forbes column as \"Primary Source Material\" for their Truth-O-Meter analysis. In one of the top national news stories of the week, the fact-checkers used my original reporting to hold both sides accountable in the heated U.S. Senate hearing. **Beginning of the end of my column at Forbes** Rather than putting the full weight of Forbes behind obtaining the 1,200 pages of unreleased Fauci financials, Forbes went after my column. On Jan. 12, Sen. Marshall [wrote a demand letter](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-sends-letter-to-dr-fauci-demanding-copies-of-financial-disclosure/) to NIH for Fauci's unredacted ethics/financial disclosures. In the letter, Marshall included footnotes that referenced my Fauci-Forbes columns. On Friday, Jan. 14 at 5:00 p.m. EST, NIH [produced Fauci's unredacted ethics/financial disclosures](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Anthony-Fauci-Financial-Disclosures-for-2020-and-2019.pdf) from 2019 and 2020 subject to Sen. Marshall's [demand letter](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-sends-letter-to-dr-fauci-demanding-copies-of-financial-disclosure/). The 2020 disclosures had never been released and only heavily redacted 2019 disclosures were previously released. Working through the night, I dug through the 178 pages of disclosure and published the breaking investigation at Forbes on Saturday, Jan. 15 at 3:03 p.m. EST: [Disclosures Show Dr. Fauci's Household Made $1.7 Million In 2020, Including Income, Royalties, Travel Perks And Investment Gains](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2022/01/15/disclosures-released-dr-fauci-household-profits-exceeded-17-million-in-2020--included-income-royalties-travel-perks-and-investment-gains/?sh=6fdc6e057d5f).

However, Justice Louis Brandeis said it best, \"There is no great writing, only great rewriting.\" A regular editor at Forbes suggested some language and style edits and identified a typo - a number that was right in the title and wrong in the text. Quickly, the edits were incorporated while the article had less than 350 views. (Today, the column has 120,000+ views and is the definitive analysis of Fauci's fiscal year (FY) 2020 financial disclosures, the latest available.) Then at 4:22 p.m. EST, I received an email from Caroline Howard, the executive editor at Forbes - a person who I had never spoken to or met during my nearly eight years as a contributor: Let's break down the executive editor's email above. \"I see this is your third article on Fauci in 3 weeks. Huh.\" Each article on Fauci from Dec. 28 through Jan. 15 published original journalism and broke national news. Each article added substantial context to the national discussion. The first article estimated Fauci's $350,000 [golden-parachute retirement pension](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/12/28/dr-anthony-faucis-retirement-pay-will-exceed-350000-per-year--the-largest-in-us-federal-government-history/?sh=342eb360609c) as the highest in U.S. federal history (Dec.28, 2021). Articles two and three (Jan. 12 and 15, 2022) resulted from the surprisingly heated Senate hearing on Fauci's finances (discussed above). Only six of my 56 published pieces at Forbes during 2021-2022 were on Fauci. But, again, each column was original reporting with important national implications. \"... the tone of your posts straying into advocacy ...\" I am a transparency advocate and it is one reason why Forbes chose me to contribute. Currently, there is a war on transparency at NIH with 633 FOIA [requests past due](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2021/12/24/national_institutes_of_health_slow_walks_633_foia_requests_-_during_a_pandemic_808490.html) triggering 33 lawsuits from various parties in federal court. Good journalism holds the agency accountable. In fact, since my appointment in May 2014 at Forbes, I only wrote about government transparency and accountability. All 206 investigations followed the money and properly cited the original research of our auditors at OpenTheBooks.com. \"Everyone who publishes on the Forbes platform must steer clear ...\" The rest of the emailed insinuations are hyperbole and borne out by the fact that Forbes [kept my author archive live](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/?sh=156f72635f81) even after my column was terminated. **National Institutes of Health pressured Forbes** On Sunday, Jan. 16 at 12:43 p.m. EST, six top communications, government relations and public affairs officers at NIH wrote a \"corrections\" email to Randall Lane, the chief content officer and editor of Forbes and me. As you can see, the email did not contain any substantial corrections. Let's break down the NIH \"corrections\" email above. Fauci [disclosed receiving](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Anthony-Fauci-Financial-Disclosures-for-2020-and-2019.pdf)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt:12:dfbc1cd20c1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10756, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "the fact that Forbes [kept my author archive live](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/?sh=156f72635f81) even after my column was terminated. **National Institutes of Health pressured Forbes** On Sunday, Jan. 16 at 12:43 p.m. EST, six top communications, government relations and public affairs officers at NIH wrote a \"corrections\" email to Randall Lane, the chief content officer and editor of Forbes and me. As you can see, the email did not contain any substantial corrections. Let's break down the NIH \"corrections\" email above. Fauci [disclosed receiving](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Anthony-Fauci-Financial-Disclosures-for-2020-and-2019.pdf) honoraria and gifts valued at $8,100 on his FY2020 ethics form. Therefore, it is fair to characterize Fauci as \"collecting\" those gifts. Fauci himself [reported those items](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Anthony-Fauci-Financial-Disclosures-for-2020-and-2019.pdf) on his ethics form in the \"gift\" section. The requested edit from NIH was a difference without a distinction. I quickly updated the piece by replacing the word \"collecting\" with \"reported.\" NIH also gave further background into Fauci's board position at McGraw-Hill and travel reimbursements, which was also incorporated. (This was the purpose of my request for comment to NIH - additional context for the reader and fairness to the subject.) NIH found nothing wrong with the major facts and analysis in my article: the Fauci household's entire cash compensation, benefit, royalty and investment portfolio. In other words, all substantive findings remained intact and validated. **Cancellation** Of course, the real purpose of the NIH's email wasn't to correct my work. Two directors, two bureau chiefs and two top PR officers didn't send an email to the Forbes' chief on a Sunday morning because they wanted to correct the record about Fauci's travel reimbursements. They sent that email to subliminally send a message: We don't like Andrzejewski's oversight work, and we want you to do something about it. Unfortunately, Forbes folded quickly. Within 24 hours of the NIH email to Randall Lane, my regular Forbes editor called and announced new rules. Forbes barred me from writing about Fauci and mandated pre-approval for all future topics. Then, Forbes went silent and terminated my column roughly 10 days later on Jan. 28. On the day Forbes canceled me, the editors bent the knee. A new piece on Fauci published: \"[Fauci's Portrait Will Soon Hang In The Smithsonian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2022/01/28/fauci-portrait-smithsonian/?sh=4873bf1c1770).\" Of course, the article was designated an Editors' Pick. Note: Forbes and NIH didn't respond to requests for comment.

More alarming yet, **she relates how fellow doctors who were seeing similar results were unwilling to share their experiences for fear of the potential backlash**.

I am fully vaccinated for Covid-19, but **my experience this year with treating patients in a busy ICU does not comport with claims made by federal health authorities regarding the safety of Covid-19 vaccines.** I am a licensed physician practicing in the state of California. I obtained my medical degree from the University of Southern California and received my postgraduate training from Georgetown University and Harvard-affiliated hospitals. **I have been a doctor for more than twenty years and I have never witnessed so many vaccine related injuries until this year.** As a fully vaccinated doctor, it hurts me to admit this. But I am conscientiously compelled to set the facts when I see them on the front lines. Below are some vivid examples of damage related to the Covid-19 vaccination that I have observed firsthand. While causality is difficult to clearly prove, my clinical judgment is that each of these injuries was caused by a Covid-19 vaccine because **there was no plausible explanation for these injuries other than the fact that the patients had recently been vaccinated.** I had a direct doctor-patient relationship with each of the patients listed below and have removed all personal data. To further assure patient anonymity, certain medical but inconsequential details have been withheld or changed to ensure the absence of any PII [personally identifiably information]. An otherwise healthy patient under 40 developed lower back pain and an episode of urinary incontinence after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. **The day after the second dose, the patient felt numbness and tingling down one leg. **The symptoms progressed rapidly, so that a few days later the patient was admitted to the hospital for bilateral leg paralysis. MRI showed transverse myelitis. Weekly follow-up imaging showed that the process continued to worsen and ascend, despite maximum medical therapy. **Eventually the patient became quadriplegic, blind and had a tracheostomy placed.** The patient developed autonomic dysfunction (irregular heart rate and hypotension) and became cognitively impaired. A generally healthy patient in the early seventies with no history of smoking or any previous lung disease received a Covid-19 vaccine and developed a general malaise with loss of appetite and a new cough. According to the spouse, the patient lost more than 15 pounds during that period. The cough worsened over the next month and the patient was hospitalized. The CT scan of the chest showed bilateral diffuse frosted glass opacities typical of COVID pneumonia. However, the patient was COVID negative on repeated tests.

The patient has deteriorated clinically and has had to be intubated. **Bronchoscopy with alveolar lavage was positive for Pneumocystis Pneumonia, a rare opportunistic infection which typically only affects severely immunocompromised patients such as AIDS or transplant patients. Patient developed multi-organ system failure.** A generally healthy patient in the early seventies was given a Covid-19 vaccine. The patient then developed vague gastrointestinal complaints and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus colitis, which was refractory to outpatient therapy. **Over the next several weeks, patient was repeatedly admitted to hospital for inpatient treatment. Despite maximum medical therapy, patient developed disseminated CMV and CMV viraemia, usually seen only in immunocompromised patients.** Two women in their early fifties presented to the hospital after developing acute abdominal catastrophes. **Both families reported that the women had developed vague GI complaints shortly following their Covid-19 vaccine, which then progressed to acute surgical abdomen on the day of admission.** Both women were taken to the operating room for examination, where several segments of the infarcted bowel were resected. As the ischemic and thrombotic process appeared to be on-going, **both patients had to have their abdomens left open in the next several days for frequent re-exploration and repeated resections** totaling more than five exploratory laparotomies each. Neither woman had a smoking history. Neither woman had any condition predisposing them to a hypercoagulable state. All of their work-ups were negative. A man in his early sixties received the Covid-19 vaccine and developed dizziness that got worse over time. He had no history of smoking and was otherwise healthy. On the day of hospital admission, patient experienced sudden neurological deterioration and required intubation for airway protection. **Imaging studies of the head showed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.** CVST is a very rare type of stroke, estimated by Johns Hopkins to be 5 per million per year, with a female to male ratio of 3: 1. Over 85% of patients had at least one identifiable risk factor, such as B. prothrombotic condition, use of oral contraceptives, malignancy or infection. **My patient had zero risk factors, other than the fact that he had been vaccinated against Covid-19.** **In my ICU, I have observed a recent increase in obstetric complications.

Those who survived are struggling with long-term sequelae and a diminished quality of life.** I understand that the above report reflects the experience of an individual health care professional. However it appears statistically improbable that any one physician should witness this many Covid-19 vaccine injuries if the federal health authority's claims regarding Covid-19 vaccine safety were accurate.** I have spoken with colleagues who have also had similar experiences in treating patients. While some seem willing to accept these vaccine injuries as unavoidable collateral damage in a mass vaccination program, many do express dismay. None of them would speak publicly about their experience,** with the former not wanting to fuel vaccine hesitancy and the latter fearing potential backlash. Hence, I am writing this letter to share my experience. **I can no longer silently accept the serious harm being caused by the Covid-19 vaccines.** It is my sincere hope that the response to this letter will not be to focus on me, but rather focus on addressing the serious safety issues with these products that, without doubt, you have either missed or are choosing to ignore. On a related note, I work with a number of frontline workers that have seen these harms firsthand. They courageously worked through the pandemic and some have already had Covid-19. Many of them have not received the Covid-19 vaccines and these excellent health workers are badly needed in every hospital, yet they plan to quit or be discharged rather than receive this Covid-19 vaccine. I can't afford to lose these members of my team. **Furthermore, in light of the foregoing, it is unethical to have a blanket Covid-19 vaccine mandate without regards to each individual's the medical risk-benefit profile.** So I'm asking you to lift the state Covid-19 vaccine mandate and encourage the state of California to do the same. We must return to the practice of obtaining informed consent, born out of a private discussion between a doctor and a patient, without third‐party intrusion. **Lastly, on behalf of the patients and their families who have suffered so much at the hands of this vaccine, and on behalf of my frontline health colleagues who have born witness to these indescribable sufferings, I respectfully request that you at least acknowledge their pain and injury.****** Denying them the truth of their experience only adds deep insult to their injury.

Because that is a perspective widely covered, our main mission at [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) is to investigate challenging views and issues that continue to remain in the shadows of public awareness. Our intentions are not to vilify or discredit any side, but to educate those who seek perspectives beyond official narratives. We invite you to explore this long-form essay about the latest revelations regarding COVID vaccine injuries, the rise of COVID vaccine-related lawsuits, examining Big Pharma corruption, and media censorship (including vaccine giant Moderna's new disinformation department). Hey WantToKnow.info readers, 37 year-old O'Brian Pastrana was a dedicated firefighter for the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) for almost a decade. In the wake of the [COVID vaccine mandates](https://nypost.com/2023/02/06/eric-adams-lifts-covid-19-mandate-for-nyc-workers/) for NYC workers, he got vaccinated. His first Pfizer shot landed him in the emergency room three times due to severe allergic reactions. Complying with the city wide mandate, he got his second Pfizer dose which landed him in the hospital again. A few months later, Pastrana was nearly in heart failure. He was diagnosed with myocarditis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the cardiac muscle. Now suffering from permanent heart damage, he was told he could never be a firefighter again, and was forced to retire. He was given a non-line-of-duty pension, which pays out less than half of his salary plus overtime. Pastrana is currently undergoing a legal process for accidental disability pension benefits. In the meantime, he has been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety due to the damages from the COVID vaccine and government mandate. He is unable to play catch with his 12-year-old daughter or help his wife around the house. President of the FDNY Uniformed Firefighter Association Andrew Ansbro expressed solidarity with Pastrana. The city \"held his job over his head and forced him to choose between a vaccine that he did not want, and feeding his family,\" he told [*The New York Post*](https://nypost.com/2023/11/25/metro/fdny-vet-sues-for-disability-pension-after-covid-vax-reax/). Pastrana's tragic story is part of a growing call for a nuanced discussion on the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines. This includes the vaccine mandates that followed its rollout, where those questioning vaccine safety were punished and ridiculed on a massive scale. **Whether or not the COVID vaccines saved lives and regardless of where each of us stand on the subject of vaccines, a real science-based approach would be to follow the evidence wherever it leads. Undisclosed safety risks and harms must be investigated, even if those investigations produce inconvenient findings.** This is especially important in a time where top leaders", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption.txt:0:0098b0ba2be8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10765, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "includes the vaccine mandates that followed its rollout, where those questioning vaccine safety were punished and ridiculed on a massive scale. **Whether or not the COVID vaccines saved lives and regardless of where each of us stand on the subject of vaccines, a real science-based approach would be to follow the evidence wherever it leads.

Currently, there is minimal mainstream dialogue about the harms and injuries associated with the COVID vaccine. Instead, we're told that vaccine injuries are rare. Yet public backlash against the COVID vaccine, including landmark lawsuits, is beginning to emerge. More importantly, the people speaking out aren't [MAGA conspiracy theorists](https://theconversation.com/white-supremacist-and-far-right-ideology-underpin-anti-vax-movements-172289). They're also not \"vaccine misinformation superspreaders,\" a derogatory label for the \"12 people behind most vaccine hoaxes on social media,\" as [NPR claims](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes). **Those speaking out are a growing number of everyday people who stepped up to get the COVID vaccine, suffered serious injuries and deaths, and were abandoned by the medical and media systems. **Mainstream media portrayals of COVID vaccine harm ignore the growing mountain of evidence supporting dissenting views. According to a [recent Rasmussen Reports poll](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/public_surveys/killer_jab_24_say_someone_they_know_died_from_covid_19_vaccine), \"24% of American Adults say they know someone personally who died from side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.\" The numbers speak for themselves. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a [voluntary government reporting system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) that [only captures a portion of the actual injuries](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-electronic-support-public-healthvaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system). **Vaccine adverse event numbers are [made publically available](https://openvaers.com/), and currently show 2,543,974 COVID vaccine injury reports, 36,501 COVID Vaccine Reported Deaths, and 211,257 COVID Vaccine Reported Hospitalizations. ** **Recent findings by *The BMJ,* a renowned medical journal, reveal that the VAERS system [presents an incomplete and incorrect picture of vaccine injuries](https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2582). ** The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) ... collects reports of symptoms, diagnoses, hospital admissions, and deaths after vaccination. VAERS is supposed to be user friendly, responsive, and transparent. However, investigations by The BMJ have uncovered that it's not meeting its own standards. Not only have staffing levels failed to keep pace with the unprecedented number of reports since the rollout of covid vaccines but there are signs that the system is overwhelmed. In the face of an unprecedented 1.7 million reports since the rollout of covid vaccines, VAERS's staffing was likely not commensurate with the demands of reviewing the serious reports submitted, including reports of death. **While other countries have acknowledged deaths that were \"likely\" or \"probably\" related to mRNA vaccination, the CDC-which says that it has reviewed nearly 20,000 preliminary reports of death using VAERS (far more than other countries)-has not acknowledged a single death linked to mRNA vaccines. **In November 2022, React19, an", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption.txt:1:69172da26597", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10766, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-vaccine-injuries-lawsuits-big-pharma-corruption", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of an unprecedented 1.7 million reports since the rollout of covid vaccines, VAERS's staffing was likely not commensurate with the demands of reviewing the serious reports submitted, including reports of death. **While other countries have acknowledged deaths that were \"likely\" or \"probably\" related to mRNA vaccination, the CDC-which says that it has reviewed nearly 20,000 preliminary reports of death using VAERS (far more than other countries)-has not acknowledged a single death linked to mRNA vaccines. **In November 2022, React19, an advocacy group of some 30,000 people who have experienced prolonged illness after covid vaccination, reviewed 126 VAERS reports among its ranks. 22% had never been given a permanent VAERS ID number and 12% had disappeared from the system entirely.** The BMJ has found that the FDA and CDC essentially maintain two separate VAERS databases: a public facing database, containing only initial reports; and a private, back end system containing all updates and corrections-such as a formal diagnosis, recovery, or death.** Albert Benavides is a VAERS researcher who recently wrote a [comprehensive Substack piece](https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/the-bmj-investigates-the-broken-system) investigating the corruption and dysfunction of the VAERS system, including how the VAERS system even deleted dead Pfizer Trial patients: Interviews with more than a dozen VAERS users by The BMJ-all of whom were trying to file reports of a serious nature-revealed a patchy and frustrating experience. Some users heard back from clinical reviewers months after making their first report, while others never heard anything. Some of those making reports were told conflicting information about updating their report or were discouraged from making a report altogether. Those people include Patrick Whelan, a rheumatologist and researcher at the University of California Los Angeles, who in 2022 reported how one of his patients, a 7 year old boy, had a cardiac arrest after covid vaccination. The patient was intubated when Whelan filed a VAERS report, and he expected a prompt follow-up call from a CDC investigator. **\"I assumed that, since it was a catastrophic event, the safety committee would want to hear about it right away,\" he says. But, to his knowledge, nobody called or requested medical records. ** James Gill has been a medical examiner and forensic pathologist for 25 years and is currently chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut. In June 2021 he made the first VAERS report of his career. It was for a 15 year old boy who died suddenly days after getting a second jab-what Gill concluded on autopsy was \"stress cardiomyopathy following second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 vaccine.\" Gill, who has appointments at Yale University and the University of Connecticut, can't recall getting any calls from VAERS after he filled out the online form, and he still has only a temporary \"e-report\" number.

After he published the case reports in the Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine in February 2022, however, the CDC did respond-in the form of a letter to the editor contesting Gill's findings. A week after Whelan filed the VAERS report for his young patient in Los Angeles, he had cause to update it. The boy's condition didn't improve, and the decision was made to terminate life support. But \"there was no mechanism for [updating] it,\" he tells The BMJ. \"The only option I had was to make a new VAERS report.\" **Today, however, that VAERS report still shows the child as having been admitted to hospital. \"I made the false assumption that that conversation would result in an adjustment in the publicly reported case,\" says Whelan. \"Think of all the people who are using VAERS data as a means to assess what's happening with the vaccines-except in this case you'd be left with the false impression that the child had had a serious adverse event,\" rather than seeing that he'd died. ** Current and former FDA advisers and academics [recently asked the FDA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-we-tried-improve-covid-vaccine-labeling--fda-said-no-thanks) to make critical changes to official COVID vaccine product labels, citing a range of significant adverse events and injuries post vaccination. This included multiple autopsy studies on lethal vaccination-associated myocarditis, multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), pulmonary embolism, sudden cardiac death, neuropathology and autonomic disorders, decreased sperm concentration, heavy menstrual bleeding and detection of vaccine mRNA in breast milk. Four months later, the agency denied almost every request. While former CDC director Rochelle Walenksy claimed that the US government had not seen any reports of myocarditis, [internal CDC emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23977570-israeli-warning-and-cdc-emails) obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request reveal multiple threads discussing myocarditis, including a [US government memorandum](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23977568-us-government-memorandum-on-early-postvaccination-myocarditis-cases) from March 2021 that acknowledged there were cases of myocarditis reported in the US VAERS system. This memo was a response to an email from the Israeli Ministry of Health, who addressed the CDC and FDA in concern about a large number of reports of myocarditis following the Pfizer vaccine, particularly in young people. As journalist Alex Gutentag [writes in a Substack piece](https://public.substack.com/p/cdc-covered-up-covid-vaccine-myocarditis), **\"The CDC has not released complete, updated data on myocarditis.

The plaintiffs blame the COVID vaccine for causing a wide range of ailments including Bell's palsy, blood clots in the brain, vertigo, vascular inflammation, chronic fatigue syndrome, small fiber neuropathy, heart palpitations and more. Currently, the CICP is the only avenue through which those with a COVID-19 vaccine injury can seek compensation. **Currently, 12,233 Covid-19 claims have been filed with the CICP**. More than 9,000 of those allege Covid-19 vaccines were involved in injuries or deaths. While only a small fraction of Countermeasure Program's Covid claims have been addressed, the overwhelming majority of those-1,235-have been denied. Most missed a filing deadline. **The program has deemed 32 claims eligible for compensation; only 6 have resulted in compensation. ** \"There's probably a large number of injured people, and the more negative outcomes that are realized through the CICP, I think you'll have more frustrated individuals,\" [past president of the Vaccine Injured Petitioners Bar Association Christina ] Ciampolillo said. The CICP essentially shields drugmakers from lawsuits. But [attorney David] Carney said that given there's \"not a sufficient legal forum to adjudicate\" Covid-19 injury claims and that the CICP isn't \"a suitable alternative to civil tort litigation,\" it is arguable that pharmaceutical companies could be next in line to be sued. \"Very soon, we're going to see people sue the vaccine manufacturers,\" Carney said. - \"[Covid Vaccine Injury Suit May Fuel Federal Overhaul, Litigation](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/covid-vaccine-injury-suit-may-fuel-federal-overhaul-litigation),\" *Bloomberg Law * In the UK, a [legal landmark case](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-jab-was-defective-claims-landmark-legal-case) alleges significant injuries and damages from the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine.

Kim Witczak, an FDA advisory committee member who reviews new drugs coming to market, began investigating the US drug safety system after her husband unexpectedly took his own life while taking the antidepressant Zoloft. What she found was industry-wide corruption and compromised regulatory agencies. Corporate profits were put ahead of science. Drug safety and clinical trial integrity suffered as a result: If you haven't heard of Zoloft, you've certainly heard of one of its many competitors-Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac-each one a blockbuster product that brought in billions of dollars for drug makers. When I began looking into the history of these medications,** I was shocked to learn that the FDA first held hearings on Prozac and the links to violent behavior and suicide in 1991-twelve years before Woody began taking Zoloft. Physicians advising the FDA concluded there was no link between Prozac and suicide, but many of these experts had a financial link to antidepressant drug makers. **Nonetheless, the FDA told Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, to study the issue of suicidality. But Eli Lilly never did the studies, and the FDA never followed up. It wasn't until 2004, the year after Woody took his own life, that the FDA was forced to investigate the suicide issue. And the agency only did this after the UK came out with warnings for children.

If vaccination was indeed the most effective way to end the pandemic, a democratic and pro-science society would still seek to understand the risks of the COVID vaccines. Many of these risks are only beginning to come to light. The bedrock of democracy is the open flow of debate and information, which includes the process of exploring what's left out of any single narrative. Censorship is a tool to hide exploitation and injustice. The suppression of dissent creates the \"[illusion of consensus](https://www.illusionconsensus.com/p/exclusive-interview-with-dr-joseph#details)\" in medicine, leading to a society that unquestioningly trusts official narratives at the expense of countless injuries and deaths. What gives Big Government, Tech, and Pharma the right to censor and ridicule information that opposes their interests? What are we to do about what some consider \"misinformation\" today, but not on examination later? **If there is any risk to these medicines and vaccines, there must be choice and informed consent-not harsh mandates, censorship, medical gaslighting, and cancel culture.** The silencing of alternative narratives weakens our collective muscles to collaborate and solve problems across our differences. I believe in a better version of humanity than that. And I know most of us do too.

For the first time in history medical treatment, protocols are not being formulated based on the experience of the physicians treating the largest number of patients successfully, but rather individuals and bureaucracies that have never treated a single patient-including Bill Gates, EcoHealth Alliance, state public health officers and hospital administrators.[[23](#ref23),[38](#ref38)] The media (TV, newspapers, magazines, etc), medical societies, state medical boards and the owners of social media have appointed themselves to be the sole source of information concerning this \"pandemic\". **Websites have been removed, highly credentialed and experienced clinical doctors and scientific experts in the field of infectious diseases have been demonized, careers have been destroyed and all dissenting information has been labeled \"misinformation\" and \"dangerous lies\", even when sourced from top experts in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, pulmonary critical care, and epidemiology. ** These blackouts of truth occur even when this information is backed by extensive scientific citations from some of the most qualified medical specialists in the world.[[23](#ref23)]** Incredibly, even individuals, such as [Dr. Michael Yeadon](https://www.aier.org/article/an-education-in-viruses-and-public-health-from-michael-yeadon-former-vp-of-pfizer/), a retired ex-Chief Scientist, and vice-president for the science division of Pfizer Pharmaceutical company in the UK, who charged the company with making an extremely dangerous vaccine, is ignored and demonized. **Further, he, along with other highly qualified scientists have stated that no one should take this vaccine. **[Dr. Peter McCullough](https://thetexan.news/cardiologist-offers-guidance-on-early-treatment-of-covid-19/), one of the [most cited experts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzqEaOkAAAAJ&hl=en) in his field, who has successfully treated over 2000 COVID patients by using a protocol of early treatment (which the so-called experts completely ignored), has been the victim of a particularly vicious assault by those benefiting financially from the vaccines.** He has published his results in peer reviewed journals, reporting an 80% reduction in hospitalizations and a 75% reduction in deaths by using early treatment.[[44](#ref44)] Despite this, he is under an unrelenting series of attacks by the information controllers, none of which have treated a single patient. **Neither Anthony Fauci, the CDC, WHO nor any medical governmental establishment has ever offered any early treatment other than Tylenol, hydration and call an ambulance once you have difficulty breathing.** **This is unprecedented in the entire history of medical care as early treatment", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:1:8516eb21484b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10775, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "an 80% reduction in hospitalizations and a 75% reduction in deaths by using early treatment.[[44](#ref44)] Despite this, he is under an unrelenting series of attacks by the information controllers, none of which have treated a single patient. **Neither Anthony Fauci, the CDC, WHO nor any medical governmental establishment has ever offered any early treatment other than Tylenol, hydration and call an ambulance once you have difficulty breathing.** **This is unprecedented in the entire history of medical care as early treatment of infections is critical to saving lives and preventing severe complications.** Not only have these medical organizations and federal lapdogs not even suggested early treatment, they attacked anyone who attempted to initiate such treatment with all the weapons at their disposal-loss of license, removal of hospital privileges, shaming, destruction of reputations and even arrest.[[2](#ref2)] A good example of this outrage against freedom of speech and providing informed consent information is the recent suspension by the medical board in Maine of Dr. Meryl Nass' medical license and the ordering of her to undergo a psychiatric evaluation for prescribing Ivermectin and sharing her expertise in this field.[[9](#ref9),[65](#ref65)] I know Dr, Nass personally and can vouch for her integrity, brilliance and dedication to truth. Her scientific credentials are impeccable. This behavior by a medical licensing board is reminiscent of the methodology of the Soviet KGB during the period when dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric gulags to silence their dissent. OTHER UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS **Another unprecedented tactic is to remove dissenting doctors from their positions as journal editors, reviewers and retracting of their scientific papers from journals, even after these papers have been in print.** Until this pandemic event, I have never seen so many journal papers being retracted- the vast majority promoting alternatives to official dogma, especially if the papers question vaccine safety. Normally a submitted paper or study is reviewed by experts in the field, called peer review. These reviews can be quite intense and nit picking in detail, insisting that all errors within the paper be corrected before publication. So, unless fraud or some other major hidden problem is discovered after the paper is in print, the paper remains in the scientific literature. **We are now witnessing a growing number of excellent scientific papers, written by top experts in the field, being retracted from major medical and scientific journals weeks, months and even years after publication.** A careful review indicates that in far too many instances the authors dared question accepted dogma by the controllers of scientific publications-especially concerning the safety, alternative treatments or efficacy of vaccines.[[12](#ref12),[63](#ref63)] **These journals rely on extensive advertising by pharmaceutical companies for their revenue.** Several instances have occurred where powerful pharmaceutical companies exerted their influence on owners of these journals to remove articles that in any way question these companies' products.[[13](#ref13),[34](#ref34),[35](#ref35)] Worse still is the actual designing of medical articles for promoting drugs and pharmaceutical products that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:2:455f1720222e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10776, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "far too many instances the authors dared question accepted dogma by the controllers of scientific publications-especially concerning the safety, alternative treatments or efficacy of vaccines.[[12](#ref12),[63](#ref63)] **These journals rely on extensive advertising by pharmaceutical companies for their revenue.** Several instances have occurred where powerful pharmaceutical companies exerted their influence on owners of these journals to remove articles that in any way question these companies' products.[[13](#ref13),[34](#ref34),[35](#ref35)] Worse still is the actual designing of medical articles for promoting drugs and pharmaceutical products that involve fake studies, so-called ghostwritten articles.[[49](#ref49),[64](#ref64)] Richard Horton is quoted by the Guardian as saying** \"journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry.\"**[[13](#ref13),[63](#ref63)] Proven fraudulent \"ghostwritten\" articles sponsored by pharmaceutical giants have appeared regularly in top clinical journals, such as JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine-never to be removed despite proven scientific abuse and manipulation of data.[[49](#ref49),[63](#ref63)] Ghostwritten articles involve using planning companies whose job it is to design articles containing manipulated data to support a pharmaceutical product and then have these articles accepted by high-impact clinical journals, that is, the journals most likely to affect clinical decision making of doctors. Further, they supply doctors in clinical practice with free reprints of these manipulated articles. **[The Guardian found 250 companies](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/20/drug-companies-ghost-writing-journalism) engaged in this ghostwriting business. **The final step in designing these articles for publication in the most prestigious journals is to recruit well recognized medical experts from prestigious institutions, to add their name to these articles. These recruited medical authors are either paid upon agreeing to add their name to these pre-written articles or they do so for the prestige of having their name on an article in a prestigious medical journal.[[11](#ref11)] Of vital importance is the observation by experts in the field of medical publishing that nothing has been done to stop this abuse. Medical ethicists have lamented that because of this widespread practice \"you can't trust anything.\" While some journals insist on disclosure information, most doctors reading these articles ignore this information or excuse it and several journals make disclosure more difficult by requiring the reader to find the disclosure statements at another location. Many journals do not police such statements and omissions by authors are common and without punishment. As concerns the information made available to the public, **virtually all the media is under the control of these pharmaceutical giants or others who are benefitting from this \"pandemic\".** Their stories are all the same, both in content and even wording. Orchestrated coverups occur daily and massive data exposing the lies being generated by these information controllers are hidden from the public. All data coming over the national media (TV, newspaper and magazines), as well as the local news you watch every day, comes only from \"official\" sources-most of which are lies, distortions or completely manufactured out of whole cloth-all aimed to deceive the public. **Television media receives the majority of its advertising budget", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:3:48c4c7e76823", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10777, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "same, both in content and even wording.

That buys a lot of influence and control over the media. World famous experts within all fields of infectious diseases are excluded from media exposure and from social media should they in any way deviate against the concocted lies and distortions by the makers of these vaccines. In addition, these pharmaceutical companies spend tens of millions on social media advertising, with Pfizer leading the pack with $55 million in 2020.[[14](#ref14)] While these attacks on free speech are terrifying enough, **even worse is the virtually universal control hospital administrators have exercised over the details of medical care in hospitals. These hirelings are now instructing doctors which treatment protocols they will adhere to and which treatments they will not use, **no matter how harmful the \"approved\" treatments are or how beneficial the \"unapproved\" treatments are.[[33](#ref33),[57](#ref57)] **Never in the history of American medicine have hospital administrators dictated to its physicians how they will practice medicine and what medications they can use.** The CDC has no authority to dictate to hospitals or doctors concerning medical treatments. Yet, most physicians complied without the slightest resistance. **The federal Care Act encouraged this human disaster by offering all US hospitals up to 39,000 dollars for each ICU patient they put on respirators, despite the fact that early on it was obvious that the respirators were a major cause of death among these unsuspecting, trusting patients. In addition, the hospitals received 12,000 dollars for each patient that was admitted to the ICU-explaining, in my opinion and others, why all federal medical bureaucracies (CDC, FDA, NIAID, NIH, etc) did all in their power to prevent life- saving early treatments.**[[46](#ref46)] Letting patients deteriorate to the point they needed hospitalization, meant big money for all hospitals. A growing number of hospitals are in danger of bankruptcy, and many have closed their doors, even before this \"pandemic\".[[50](#ref50)] Most of these hospitals are now owned by national or international corporations, including teaching hospitals.[[10](#ref10)] **It is also interesting to note that with the arrival of this \"pandemic\" we have witnessed a surge in hospital corporate chains buying up a number of these financially at-risk hospitals**.[[1](#ref1),[54](#ref54)] It has", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:4:d4548af9419f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10778, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "to the point they needed hospitalization, meant big money for all hospitals.

Physicians expelled from their hospitals are finding it difficult to find other hospitals staffs to join since they too may be owned by the same corporate giant. As a result, vaccine mandate policies include far larger numbers of hospital employees. For example, **Mayo Clinic fired 700 employees for exercising their right to refuse a dangerous, essentially untested experimental vaccine**.[[51](#ref51),[57](#ref57)] Mayo Clinic did this despite the fact that many of these employees worked during the worst of the epidemic and are being fired when the Omicron variant is the dominant strain of the virus, has the pathogenicity of a common cold for most and the vaccines are ineffective in preventing the infection. In addition, it has been proven that the vaccinated asymptomatic person has a nasopharyngeal titer of the virus as high as an infected unvaccinated person. If the purpose of the vaccine mandate is to prevent viral spread among the hospital staff and patients, then it is the vaccinated who present the greatest risk of transmission, not the unvaccinated. The difference is that a sick unvaccinated person would not go to work, the asymptomatic vaccinated spreader will. What we do know is that major medical centers, such as Mayo Clinic, receive tens of millions of dollars in NIH grants each year as well as monies from the pharmaceutical makers of these experimental \"vaccines\". In my view, that is the real consideration driving these policies. If this could be proven in a court of law the administrators making these mandates should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sued by all injured parties. **The hospital bankruptcy problem has grown increasingly acute due to hospitals vaccine mandates and resulting large number of hospitals staff, especially nurses, refusing to be forcibly vaccinated.[[17](#ref17),[51](#ref51)] This is all unprecedented in the history of medical care.** Doctors within hospitals are responsible for the treatment of their individual patients and work directly with these patients and their families to initiate these treatments. Outside organizations, such as the CDC, have no authority to intervene in these treatments and to do so exposes the patients to grave errors by an organization that has never treated a single COVID-19 patient. When this pandemic started, hospitals were ordered", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:5:272b4ee31cd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10779, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "be forcibly vaccinated.[[17](#ref17),[51](#ref51)] This is all unprecedented in the history of medical care.** Doctors within hospitals are responsible for the treatment of their individual patients and work directly with these patients and their families to initiate these treatments. Outside organizations, such as the CDC, have no authority to intervene in these treatments and to do so exposes the patients to grave errors by an organization that has never treated a single COVID-19 patient. When this pandemic started, hospitals were ordered by the CDC to follow a treatment protocol that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of patients, most of whom would have recovered had proper treatments been allowed.[[43](#ref43),[44](#ref44)] The majority of these deaths could have been prevented had doctors been allowed to use early treatment with such products as Ivermectin, hydroxy-chloroquine and a number of other safe drugs and natural compounds. **It has been estimated, based on results by physicians treating the most covid patients successfully, that of the 800,000 people that we are told died from Covid, 640,000 could have not only been saved, but could have, in many cases, returned to their pre-infection health status had mandated early treatment with these proven methods been used. This neglect of early treatment constitutes mass murder. **That means 160,000 would have actually died, far less than the number dying at the hands of bureaucracies, medical associations and medical boards that refused to stand up for their patients. According to studies of early treatment of thousands of patients by brave, caring doctors, seventy-five to eighty percent of the deaths could have been prevented.[[43](#ref43),[44](#ref44)] Incredibly, these knowledgeable doctors were prevented from saving these Covid-19 infected people. It should be an embarrassment to the medical profession that so many doctors mindlessly followed the deadly protocols established by the controllers of medicine. One must also keep in mind that this event never satisfied the criteria for a pandemic. The World Health Organization changed the criteria to make this a pandemic. To qualify for a pandemic status the virus must have a high mortality rate for the vast majority of people, which it didn't (with a 99.98% survival rate), and it must have no known existing treatments-which this virus had-in fact, a growing number of very successful treatments. **The draconian measures established to contain this contrived \"pandemic\" have never been shown to be successful, such as masking the public, lockdowns, and social distancing. A number of carefully done studies during previous flu seasons demonstrated that masks, of any kind, had never prevented the spread of the virus among the public.**[[60](#ref60)] In fact, some very good studies suggested that the masks actually spread the virus by giving people a false sense of security and other factors, such as the observation that people were constantly breaking sterile technique by touching their mask, improper removal and by leakage of infectious aerosols around the edges of the mask.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:6:a763dd580ac9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10780, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "number of carefully done studies during previous flu seasons demonstrated that masks, of any kind, had never prevented the spread of the virus among the public.**[[60](#ref60)] In fact, some very good studies suggested that the masks actually spread the virus by giving people a false sense of security and other factors, such as the observation that people were constantly breaking sterile technique by touching their mask, improper removal and by leakage of infectious aerosols around the edges of the mask. In addition masks were being disposed of in parking lots, walking trails, laid on tabletops in restaurants and placed in pockets and purses. Within a few minutes of putting on the mask, a number of pathogenic bacteria can be cultured from the masks, putting the immune suppressed person at a high risk of bacterial pneumonia and children at a higher risk of meningitis.[[16](#ref16)] A study by researchers at the University of Florida cultured over 11 pathogenic bacteria from the inside of the mask worn by children in schools.[[40](#ref40)] **It was also known that children were at essentially no risk of either getting sick from the virus or transmitting it.** In addition, it was also known that wearing a mask for over 4 hours (as occurs in all schools) results in significant hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high CO2 levels), which have a number of deleterious effects on health, including impairing the development of the child's brain.[[4](#ref4),[72](#ref72),[52](#ref52)] We have known that brain development continues long after the grade school years. A recent study found that children born during the \"pandemic\" have significantly lower IQs-yet school boards, school principals and other educational bureaucrats are obviously unconcerned.[[18](#ref18)] TOOLS OF THE INDOCTRINATION TRADE The designers of this pandemic anticipated a pushback by the public and that major embarrassing questions would be asked. To prevent this, the controllers fed the media a number of tactics, one of the most commonly used was and is the \"fact check\" scam. With each confrontation with carefully documented evidence, the media \"fact checkers\" countered with the charge of \"misinformation\", and an unfounded \"conspiracy theory\" charge that was, in their lexicon, \"debunked\". **Never were we told who the fact checkers were or the source of their \"debunking\" information-we were just to believe the \"fact checkers\".

Fauci will insist on the covid vaccine for small children and even babies. Vaccine passports will be required to enter a business, fly in a plane, and use public transportation **There will be internment camps for the unvaccinated (as in Australia, Austria and Canada)** The unvaccinated will be denied employment. There are secret agreements between the government, elitist institutions, and vaccine makers Many hospitals were either empty or had low occupancy during the pandemic. The spike protein from the vaccine enters the nucleus of the cell, altering cell DNA repair function. **Hundreds of thousands have been killed by the vaccines and many times more have been permanently damaged.** Early treatment could have saved the lives of most of the 700,000 who died. Vaccine-induced myocarditis (which was denied initially) is a significant problem and clears over a short period. Special deadly lots (batches) of these vaccines are mixed with the mass of other Covid-19 vaccines **Several of these claims by those opposing these vaccines now appear on the CDC website-most still identified as \"myths\". Today, extensive evidence has confirmed that each of these so-called \"myths\" were in fact true. **Many are even admitted by the \"saint of vaccines\", Anthony Fauci. For example, we were told, even by our cognitively impaired President, that once the vaccine was released all the vaccinated people could take off their masks. Oops! We were told shortly afterward- the vaccinated have high concentrations (titers) of the virus in their noses and mouths (nasopharynx) and can transmit the virus to others in which they come into contact-especially their own family members. On go the masks once again- in fact double masking is recommended. **The vaccinated are now known to be the main superspreaders of the virus and hospitals are filled with the sick vaccinated and people suffering from serious vaccine complications**.[[27](#ref27),[42](#ref42),[45](#ref45)] Another tactic by the vaccine proponents is to demonize those who reject being vaccinated for a variety of reasons.

This is hard to conceptualize. This level of cruelty is terrifying, and signifies the collapse of a moral, decent, and compassionate society. It is bad enough for the public to sink this low, but the media, political leaders, hospital administrators, medical associations and medical licensing boards are acting in a similar morally dysfunctional and cruel way. LOGIC, REASONING, AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS DISAPPEARED IN THIS EVENT Has scientific evidence, carefully done studies, clinical experience and medical logic had any effect on stopping these ineffective and dangerous vaccines? Absolutely not! The draconian efforts to vaccinate everyone on the planet continues (except the elite, postal workers, members of Congress and other insiders).[[31](#ref31),[62](#ref62)] **In the case of all other drugs and previous conventional vaccines under review by the FDA, the otherwise unexplained deaths of 50 or less individuals would result in a halt in further distribution of the product, as happened in [1976 with the swine flu vaccine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/health/1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript).** With over 18,000 deaths being reported by the VAERS system for the period December 14, 2020 and December 31st, 2021 as well as 139,126 serious injuries (including deaths) for the same period there is still no interest in stopping this deadly vaccine program.[[61](#ref61)] Worse,** there is no serious investigation by any government agency to determine why these people are dying and being seriously and permanently injured by these vaccines.**[[15](#ref15),[67](#ref67)] What we do see is a continuous series of coverups and evasions by the vaccine makers and their promoters. **The war against effective cheap and very safe repurposed drugs and natural compounds, that have proven beyond all doubt to have saved millions of lives all over the world, has not only continued but has stepped up in intensity.**[[32](#ref32),[34](#ref34),[43](#ref43)] **Doctors are told they cannot provide these life-saving compounds for their patients and if they do, they will be removed from the hospital, have their medical license removed or be punished in many", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:9:10d123276cbc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10783, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "evasions by the vaccine makers and their promoters. **The war against effective cheap and very safe repurposed drugs and natural compounds, that have proven beyond all doubt to have saved millions of lives all over the world, has not only continued but has stepped up in intensity.**[[32](#ref32),[34](#ref34),[43](#ref43)] **Doctors are told they cannot provide these life-saving compounds for their patients and if they do, they will be removed from the hospital, have their medical license removed or be punished in many other ways. **A great many pharmacies have refused to fill prescriptions for lvermectin or hydroxy-chloroquine, despite the fact that** millions of people have taken these drugs safely for over 60 years in the case of hydroxy-chloroquine and decades for Ivermectin.**[[33](#ref33),[36](#ref36)] This refusal to fill prescriptions is unprecedented and has been engineered by those wanting to prevent alternative methods of treatment, all based on protecting vaccine expansion to all. Several companies that make hydroxy-chloroquine agreed to empty their stocks of the drug by donating them to the Strategic National Stockpile, making this drug far more difficult to get.[[33](#ref33)] Why would the government do that when over 30 well-done studies have shown that this drug reduced deaths anywhere from 66% to 92% in other countries, such as India, Egypt, Argentina, France, Nigeria, Spain, Peru, Mexico, and others?[[23](#ref23)] **The critics of these two life-saving drugs are most often funded by Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, both of which are making millions from these vaccines.**[[48](#ref48),[15](#ref15)] To further stop the use of these drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and Bill Gates/Anthony Fauci funded fake research to make the case that hydroxy-chloroquine was a dangerous drug and could damage the heart.[[34](#ref34)] **To make this fraudulent case the researchers administered the sickest of covid patients a near lethal dose of the drug, in a dose far higher than used on any covid patient by Dr. Kory, McCullough and other \"real\", and compassionate doctors, physicians who were actually treating covid patients.**[[23](#ref23)] The controlled, lap-dog media, of course, hammered the public with stories of the deadly effect of hydroxy-chloroquine, all with a terrified look of fake panic. All these stories of ivermectin dangers were shown to be untrue and some of the stories were incredibly preposterous.[[37](#ref37),[43](#ref43)] The attack on Ivermectin was even more vicious than against hydroxy-chloroquine. **All of this, and a great deal more is meticulously chronicled in Robert Kennedy, Jr's excellent new book-*The Real Anthony Fauci.

It is fully referenced and covers all topics in great detail. This is a designed human tragedy of Biblical proportions by some of the most vile, heartless, psychopaths in history. Millions have been deliberately killed and crippled, not only by this engineered virus, but by the vaccine itself and by the draconian measures used by these governments to \"control the pandemic spread\". We must not ignore the \"deaths by despair\" caused by these draconian measures, which can exceed hundreds of thousands. Millions have starved in third world countries as a result. In the United States alone, of the 800,000 who died, claimed by the medical bureaucracies, well over 600,000 of these deaths were the result of the purposeful neglect of early treatment, blocking the use of highly effective and safe repurposed drugs, such as hydroxy-chloroquine and Ivermectin, and the forced use of deadly treatments such as remdesivir and use of ventilators. This does not count the deaths of despair and neglected medical care caused by the lockdown and hospital measures forced on healthcare systems. To compound all this, because of vaccine mandates among all hospital personnel, thousands of nurses and other hospital workers have resigned or been fired.[[17](#ref17),[30](#ref30),[51](#ref51)] This has resulted in critical shortages of these vital healthcare workers and dangerous reductions of ICU beds in many hospitals. In addition, as occurred in the Lewis County Healthcare System, a specialty-hospital system in Lowville, N.Y., closed its maternity unit following the resignation of 30 hospital staff over the state's disastrous vaccine mandate orders. **The irony in all these cases of resignations is that the administrators unhesitatingly accepted these mass staffing losses despite rantings about suffering from short staffing during a \"crisis\". This is especially puzzling when we learned that the vaccines did not prevent viral transmission and the present predominant variant is of extremely low pathogenicity.** DANGERS OF THE VACCINES ARE INCREASINGLY REVEALED BY SCIENCE **While most researchers, virologists, infectious disease researchers and epidemiologists have been intimidated into silence, a growing number of high integrity individuals with tremendous expertise have come forward to tell the truth-that is, that these vaccines are deadly.** Most new vaccines must go through extensive safety testing for years before they are approved. New technologies, such as the mRNA and DNA vaccines, require a minimum of 10 years of careful testing and extensive follow-up. **These new so-called vaccines were \"tested\" for only 2 months and then the results of these safety test were and continue to be kept secret. **Testimony before Senator Ron Johnson by several who participated in the 2 months study indicates that virtually no follow-up of the participants of the pre-release study was ever done.[[67](#ref67)]", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:11:8d5a2e888a4c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10785, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "years before they are approved.

As an example of the deception by Pfizer, and the other makers of mRNA vaccines, is the case of 12-year-old Maddie de Garay, who participated in the Pfizer vaccine pre-release safety study. At Sen. Johnson's presentation with the families of the vaccine injured, her mother told of her child's recurrent seizures, that she is now confined to a wheelchair, must be tube fed and suffers permanent brain damage. On the Pfizer safety evaluation submitted to the FDA her only side effect is listed as having a \"stomachache\". Each person submitted similar horrifying stories. The Japanese resorted to a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) lawsuit to force Pfizer to release its secret biodistribution study. The reason Pfizer wanted it kept secret is that it demonstrated that Pfizer lied to the public and the regulatory agencies about the fate of the injected vaccine contents (the mRNA enclosed nano-lipid carrier). **They claimed that it remained at the site of the injection (the shoulder), when in fact their own study found that it rapidly spread throughout the entire body by the bloodstream within 48 hours.** **The study also found that these deadly nano-lipid carriers collected in very high concentrations in several organs, including the reproductive organs of males and females, the heart, the liver, the bone marrow, and the spleen (a major immune organ). The highest concentration was in the ovaries and the bone marrow. These nano-lipid carriers also were deposited in the brain.** Dr. Ryan Cole, a pathologist from Idaho reported a dramatic spike in highly aggressive cancers among vaccinated individuals, (not reported in the Media). He found a frighteningly high incidence of highly aggressive cancers in vaccinated individuals, especially highly invasive melanomas in young people and uterine cancers in women.[[26](#ref26)] Other reports of activation of previously controlled cancers are also appearing among vaccinated cancer patients.[[47](#ref47)] Thus far, no studies have been done to confirm these reports, but it is unlikely such studies will be done, at least studies funded by grants from the NIH. **The high concentration of spike proteins found in the ovaries in the biodistribution study could very well impair fertility in young women, alter menstruation, and could put them at an increased risk", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:12:447292df7aa4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10786, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "uterine cancers in women.[[26](#ref26)] Other reports of activation of previously controlled cancers are also appearing among vaccinated cancer patients.[[47](#ref47)] Thus far, no studies have been done to confirm these reports, but it is unlikely such studies will be done, at least studies funded by grants from the NIH. **The high concentration of spike proteins found in the ovaries in the biodistribution study could very well impair fertility in young women, alter menstruation, and could put them at an increased risk of ovarian cancer. **The high concentration in the bone marrow, could also put the vaccinated at a high risk of leukemia and lymphoma. The leukemia risk is very worrisome now that they have started vaccinating children as young as 5 years of age. No long-term studies have been conducted by any of these makers of Covid-19 vaccines, especially as regards the risk of cancer induction. Chronic inflammation is intimately linked to cancer induction, growth and invasion and vaccines stimulate inflammation. Cancer patients are being told they should get vaccinated with these deadly vaccines. This, in my opinion, is insane. Newer studies have shown that this type of vaccine inserts the spike protein within the nucleus of the immune cells (and most likely many cell types) and once there, inhibits two very important DNA repair enzymes, BRCA1 and 53BP1, whose duty it is to repair damage to the cell's DNA.[[29](#ref29)] Unrepaired DNA damage plays a major role in cancer. There is a hereditary disease called xeroderma pigmentosum in which the DNA repair enzymes are defective. These ill-fated individuals develop multiple skin cancers and a very high incidence of organ cancer as a result. Here we have a vaccine that does the same thing, but to a less extensive degree. **One of the defective repair enzymes caused by these vaccines is called BRCA1, which is associated with a significantly higher incidence of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men.** It should be noted that no studies were ever done on several critical aspects of this type of vaccine. They have never been tested for long term effects They have never been tested for induction of autoimmunity **They have never been properly tested for safety during any stage of pregnancy** No follow-up studies have been done on the babies of vaccinated women There are no long-term studies on the children of vaccinated pregnant women after their birth (Especially as neurodevelopmental milestone occur). It has never been tested for effects on a long list of medical conditions: Diabetes Heart disease Atherosclerosis Neurodegenerative diseases Neuropsychiatric effects Induction of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia Long term immune function Vertical transmission of defects and disorders Cancer Autoimmune disorders **Previous experience with the flu vaccines clearly demonstrates that the safety studies done by researchers and clinical doctors with ties to pharmaceutical companies were essentially all either poorly done or purposefully designed to falsely show safety and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:13:5a41a4bafebb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10787, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "occur).

As stated, 80% of all deaths were unnecessary and could have been prevented with inexpensive, safe repurposed medications with a very long safety history among millions who have taken them for decades or even a lifetime.[[43](#ref43),[44](#ref44)] **It is beyond ironic that those claiming that they are responsible for protecting our health approved a poorly tested set of vaccines that has resulted in more deaths in less than a year of use than all the other vaccines combined given over the past 30 years. **Their excuse when confronted was-\"we had to overlook some safety measures because this was a deadly pandemic\".[[28](#ref28),[46](#ref46)] In 1986 President Reagan signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which gave blanket protection to pharmaceutical makers of vaccines against injury litigation by families of vaccine injured individuals. The Supreme Court, in a 57-page opinion, ruled in favor of the vaccine companies, effectively allowing vaccine makers to manufacture and distribute dangerous, often ineffective vaccines to the population without fear of legal consequences. The court did insist on a vaccine injury compensation system which has paid out only a very small number of rewards to a large number of severely injured individuals. It is known that it is very difficult to receive these awards. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, since 1988 the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has agreed to pay 3,597 awards among 19,098 vaccine injured individuals applying amounting to a total sum of $3.8 billion. This was prior to the introduction of the Covid-19 vaccines, in which the deaths alone exceed all deaths related to all the vaccines combined over a thirty-year period. In 2018 President Trump signed into law the \"right-to-try\" law which allowed the use of experimental drugs and all unconventional treatments to be used in cases of extreme medical conditions. As we have seen with the refusal of many hospitals and even blanket refusal by states to allow Ivermectin, hydroxy-chloroquine or any other unapproved \"official\" methods to treat even terminal Covid-19 cases, these nefarious individuals have ignored this law. **Strangely, they did not use this same logic or the law when it came to Ivermectin and hydroxy-chloroquine, both of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:14:7839caf82a52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10788, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "law which allowed the use of experimental drugs and all unconventional treatments to be used in cases of extreme medical conditions.

It was obvious that a group of very powerful people in conjunction with pharmaceutical conglomerates didn't want the pandemic to end and wanted vaccines as the only treatment option. Kennedy's book makes this case using extensive evidence and citations.[[14](#ref14),[32](#ref32)] **Dr. James Thorpe, an expert in maternal-fetal medicine, demonstrates that these covoid-19 vaccines given during pregnancy have resulted in a 50-fold higher incidence of miscarriage than reported with all other vaccines combined**.[[28](#ref28)] When we examine his graph on fetal malformations there was a 144-fold higher incidence of fetal malformation with the Covid-19 vaccines given during pregnancy as compared to all other vaccines combined. Yet, the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology endorse the safety of these vaccines for all stages of pregnancy and among women breast feeding their babies. It is noteworthy that these medical specialty groups have received significant funding from Pfizer pharmaceutical company. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, just in the 4th quarter of 2010, received a total of $11,000 from Pfizer Pharmaceutical company alone.[[70](#ref70)] Funding from NIH grants are much higher.[[20](#ref20)] **The best way to lose these grants is to criticize the source of the funds, their products or pet programs. **Peter Duesberg, because of his daring to question Fauci's pet theory of AIDS caused by HIV virus, was no longer awarded any of the 30 grant applications he submitted after going public. Prior to this episode, as the leading authority on retroviruses in the world, he had never been turned down for an NIH grant.[[39](#ref39)] This is how the \"corrupted\" system works, even though much of the grant money comes from our taxes. HOT LOTS-DEADLY BATCHES OF THE VACCINES A new study has now surfaced, the results of which are terrifying.[[25](#ref25)] A researcher at Kingston University in London, has completed an extensive analysis of the VAERS data (a subdepartment of the CDC which collects voluntary vaccine complication data), in which he grouped reported deaths following the vaccines according to the manufacturer's lot numbers of the vaccines.

Vaccines are manufactured in large batches called lots. **What he discovered was that the vaccines are divided into over 20,000 lots and that one out of every 200 of these batches (lots) is demonstrably deadly to anyone who receives a vaccine from that lot, which includes thousands of vaccine doses.** He examined all manufactured vaccines-Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen), etc. He found that among every 200 batches of the vaccine from Pfizer and other makers, one batch of the 200 was found to be over 50x more deadly than vaccines batches from other lots. The other vaccine lots (batches) were also causing deaths and disabilities, but nowhere near to this extent. These deadly batches should have appeared randomly among all \"vaccines\" if it was an unintentional event. **However, he found that 5% of the vaccines were responsible for 90% of the serious adverse events, including deaths. ** **The incidence of deaths and serious complications among these \"hot lots\" varied from over 1000% to several thousand percent higher than comparable safer lots. If you think this was by accident-think again.** This is not the first time \"hot lots\" were, in my opinion, purposefully manufactured and sent across the nation-usually vaccines designed for children. In one such scandal, \"hot lots\" of a vaccine ended up all in one state and the damage immediately became evident. What was the manufacture's response? It wasn't to remove the deadly batches of the vaccine. He ordered his company to scatter the hot lots across the nation so that authorities would not see the obvious deadly effect. All lots of a vaccine are numbered-for example Moderna labels them with such codes as 013M20A. It was noted that the batch numbers ended in either 20A or 21A. Batches ending in 20A were much more toxic than the ones ending in 21A. The batches ending in 20A had about 1700 adverse events, versus a few hundred to twenty or thirty events for the 21A batches. This example explains why some people had few or no adverse events after taking the vaccine while others are either killed or severely and permanently harmed. **To see the researcher's explanation, go to [https://www.bitchute.com/video/6xIYPZBkydsu/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/6xIYPZBkydsu/) In my opinion these examples strongly suggest an intentional alteration of the production of the \"vaccine\" to include deadly batches.** **I have met and worked with a number of people concerned with vaccine safety and I can tell you they are not the evil anti-vaxxers you are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:16:e6ab64bc23bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10790, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "example explains why some people had few or no adverse events after taking the vaccine while others are either killed or severely and permanently harmed. **To see the researcher's explanation, go to [https://www.bitchute.com/video/6xIYPZBkydsu/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/6xIYPZBkydsu/) In my opinion these examples strongly suggest an intentional alteration of the production of the \"vaccine\" to include deadly batches.** **I have met and worked with a number of people concerned with vaccine safety and I can tell you they are not the evil anti-vaxxers you are told they are.** They are highly principled, moral, compassionate people, many of which are top researchers and people who have studied the issue extensively.

They are attacked viciously by the media, government agencies, and elite billionaires who think they should control the world and everyone in it. WHY DID FAUCI WANT NO AUTOPSIES OF THOSE WHO DIED AFTER VACCINATION? There are many things about this \"pandemic\" that are unprecedented in medical history.** One of the most startling is that at the height of the pandemic so few autopsies, especially total autopsies, were being done. **A mysterious virus was rapidly spreading around the world, a selected group of people with weakened immune systems were getting seriously ill and many were dying and the one way we could rapidly gain the most knowledge about this virus-an autopsy, was being discouraged. Guerriero noted that by the end of April, 2020 approximately 150,000 people had died, yet there were only 16 autopsies performed and reported in the medical literature.[[24](#ref24)] Among these, only seven were complete autopsies, the remaining 9 being partial or by needle biopsy or incisional biopsy. Only after 170,000 deaths by Covid-19 and four months into the pandemic were the first series of autopsies actually done, that is, more than ten. And only after 280,000 deaths and another month, were the first large series of autopsies performed, some 80 in number.[[22](#ref22)] Sperhake, in a call for autopsies to be done without question, noted that the first full autopsy reported in the literature along with photomicrographs appeared in a medico-legal journal from China in February 2020.[[41](#ref41),[68](#ref68)] Sperhake expressed confusion as to why there was a reluctance to perform autopsies during the crisis, but he knew it was not coming from the pathologists. The medical literature was littered with appeals by pathologist for more autopsies to be performed.[[58](#ref58)] Sperhake further noted that the Robert Koch Institute (The German health monitoring system) at least initially advised against doing autopsies. He also knew that at the time 200 participating autopsy institutions in the United States had done at least 225 autopsies among 14 states.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:17:5d23e128a806", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10791, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "why there was a reluctance to perform autopsies during the crisis, but he knew it was not coming from the pathologists.

He also knew that at the time 200 participating autopsy institutions in the United States had done at least 225 autopsies among 14 states. Some have claimed that this dearth of autopsies was based on the government's fear of infection among the pathologists, but a study of 225 autopsies on Covid-19 cases demonstrated only one case of infection among the pathologist and this was concluded to have been an infection contracted elsewhere.[[19](#ref19)] Guerriero ends his article calling for more autopsies with this observation: \"Shoulder to shoulder, clinical and forensic pathologists overcame the obstructions of autopsy studies in Covid-19 victims and hereby generated valuable knowledge on the pathophysiology of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 and the human body, thus contributing to our understanding of the disease.\"[[24](#ref24)] Suspicion concerning the worldwide reluctance of nations to allow full post mortem studies of Covid-19 victims may be based on the idea that it was more than by chance.** There are at least two possibilities that stand out. First, those leading the progression of this \"non-pandemic\" event into a perceived worldwide \"deadly pandemic\", were hiding an important secret that autopsies could document. Namely, just how many of the deaths were actually caused by the virus?** To implement draconian measures, such as mandated mask wearing, lockdowns, destruction of businesses, and eventually mandated forced vaccination, they needed very large numbers of covid-19 infected dead. Fear would be the driving force for all these destructive pandemic control programs. Elder et al in his study classified the autopsy findings into four groups.[[22](#ref22)] Certain Covid-19 death Probably Covid-19 death Possible Covid-19 death Not associated with Covid-19, despite the positive test. What possibly concerned or even terrified the engineers of this pandemic was that autopsies just might, and did, show that a number of these so-called Covid-19 deaths in truth died of their comorbid diseases. **In the vast majority of autopsy studies reported, pathologists noted multiple comorbid conditions, most of which at the extremes of life could alone be fatal.** Previously it was known that common cold viruses had an 8% mortality in nursing homes. **In addition, valuable evidence could be obtained from the autopsies that would improve clinical treatments and could possibly demonstrate the deadly effect of the CDC mandated protocols all hospitals were required to follow, such as the use of respirators and the deadly, kidney-destroying drug remdesivir.** The autopsies also demonstrated accumulating medical errors and poor-quality care, as the shielding of doctors in intensive care units from the eyes of family members inevitably leads to poorer quality care as reported by several", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:18:74c5b0a17478", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10792, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "**In addition, valuable evidence could be obtained from the autopsies that would improve clinical treatments and could possibly demonstrate the deadly effect of the CDC mandated protocols all hospitals were required to follow, such as the use of respirators and the deadly, kidney-destroying drug remdesivir.** The autopsies also demonstrated accumulating medical errors and poor-quality care, as the shielding of doctors in intensive care units from the eyes of family members inevitably leads to poorer quality care as reported by several nurses working in these areas.[[53](#ref53)-[55](#ref55)] As bad as all this was, the very same thing is being done in the case of Covid vaccine deaths-very few complete autopsies have been done to understand why these people died, that is, until recently. Two highly qualified researchers, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi a microbiologist and highly qualified expert in infectious disease and Dr. Arne Burkhardt, a pathologist who is a widely published authority having been a professor of pathology at several prestigious institutions, recently performed autopsies on 15 people having died after vaccination. What they found explains why so many are dying and experiencing organ damage and deadly blood clots.[[5](#ref5)] **They determined that 14 of the fifteen people died as a result of the vaccines and not of other causes. Dr. Burkhardt, the pathologist, observed widespread evidence of an immune attack on the autopsied individuals' organs and tissues- especially their heart.** This evidence included extensive invasion of small blood vessels with massive numbers of lymphocytes, which cause extensive cell destruction when unleashed. Other organs, such as the lungs and liver, were observed to have extensive damage as well. **These findings indicate the vaccines were causing the body to attack itself with deadly consequences.** One can easily see why Anthony Fauci, as well as public health officers and all who are heavily promoting these vaccines, publicly discouraged autopsies on the vaccinated who subsequently died. One can also see that in the case of vaccines, that were essentially untested prior to being approved for the general public, at least the regulatory agencies should have been required to carefully monitor and analyze all serious complications, and certainly deaths, linked to these vaccines. The best way to do that is with complete autopsies. While we learned important information from these autopsies what is really needed are special studies of the tissues of those who have died after vaccination for the presence of spike protein infiltration throughout the organs and tissues. This would be critical information, as such infiltration would result in severe damage to all tissues and organs involved-especially the heart, the brain, and the immune system. Animal studies have demonstrated this. In these vaccinated individuals the source of these spike proteins would be the injected nanolipid carriers of the spike protein producing mRNA. It is obvious that the government health authorities and pharmaceutical manufacturers of these \"vaccines\" do not want these critical studies done as the public", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:19:c152345ecbc5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10793, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "and tissues.

CONCLUSIONS We are all living through one of the most drastic changes in our culture, economic system, as well as political system in our nation's history as well as the rest of the world. We have been told that we will never return to \"normal\" and that a great reset has been designed to create a \"new world order\". This has all been outlined by Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum, in his book on the \"Great Reset\".[[66](#ref66)] This book gives a great deal of insight as to the thinking of the utopians who are proud to claim this pandemic \"crisis\" as their way to usher in a new world. This new world order has been on the drawing boards of the elite manipulators for over a century.[[73](#ref73),[74](#ref74)] In this paper I have concentrated on the devastating effects this has had on the medical care system in the United States, but also includes much of the Western world. In past papers I have discussed the slow erosion of traditional medical care in the United States and how this system has become increasingly bureaucratized and regimented.[[7](#ref7),[8](#ref8)] This process was rapidly accelerating, but the appearance of this, in my opinion, manufactured \"pandemic\" has transformed our health care system over night. As you have seen, an unprecedented series of events have taken place within this system. Hospital administrators, for example, assumed the position of medical dictators, ordering doctors to follow protocols derived not from those having extensive experience in treating this virus, but rather from a medical bureaucracy that has never treated a single COVID-19 patient. The mandated use of respirators on ICU Covid-19 patients, for example, was imposed in all medical systems and dissenting physicians were rapidly removed from their positions as caregivers, despite their demonstration of markedly improved treatment methods. Further, doctors were told to use the drug remdesivir despite its proven toxicity, lack of effectiveness and high complication rate. They were told to use drugs that impaired respiration and mask every patient, despite the patient's impaired breathing. In each case, those who refused to abuse their patients were removed from the hospital and even faced a loss of license-or worse. **For the first time in modern medical history, early medical treatment of these infected patients was ignored", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:20:f721f57154f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10794, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "treatment methods. Further, doctors were told to use the drug remdesivir despite its proven toxicity, lack of effectiveness and high complication rate. They were told to use drugs that impaired respiration and mask every patient, despite the patient's impaired breathing. In each case, those who refused to abuse their patients were removed from the hospital and even faced a loss of license-or worse. **For the first time in modern medical history, early medical treatment of these infected patients was ignored nationwide.** Studies have shown that early medical treatment was saving 80% of higher number of these infected people when initiated by independent doctors.[[43](#ref43),[44](#ref44)] Early treatment could have saved over 640,000 lives over the course of this \"pandemic\". Despite the demonstration of the power of these early treatments, the forces controlling medical care continued this destructive policy. **Families were not allowed to see their loved ones, forcing these very sick individuals in the hospitals to face their deaths alone. To add insult to injury, funerals were limited to a few grieving family members, who were not allowed to even sit together. All the while large stores, such as Walmart and Costco were allowed to operate with minimal restrictions.** Nursing home patients were also not allowed to have family visitations, again being forced to die a lonely death. All the while, in a number of states, the most transparent being in New York state, infected elderly were purposefully transferred from hospitals into nursing homes, resulting in a very high death rates of these nursing home residents. At the beginning of this \"pandemic\" over 50% of all death were occurring in nursing homes. Throughout this \"pandemic\" we have been fed an unending series of lies, distortions and disinformation by the media, the public health officials, medical bureaucracies (CDC, FDA and WHO) and medical associations. Physicians, scientists, and experts in infectious treatments who formed associations designed to develop more effective and safer treatments, were regularly demonized, harassed, shamed, humiliated, and experience a loss of licensure, loss of hospital privileges and, in at least one case, ordered to have a psychiatric examination.[[2](#ref2),[65](#ref65),[71](#ref71)] **Anthony Fauci was given essentially absolute control of all forms of medical care during this event, including insisting that drugs he profited from be used by all treating physicians. He ordered the use of masks, despite at first laughing at the use of masks to filter a virus. Governors, mayors, and many businesses followed his orders without question.** The draconian measures being used, masking, lockdowns, testing of the uninfected, use of the inaccurate PCR test, social distancing, and contact tracing had been shown previously to be of little or no use during previous pandemics, yet all attempts to reject these methods were to no avail. **Some states ignored these draconian orders and had either the same or fewer cases, as well as deaths, as the states with the most strictly enforced measures. **", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:21:2095144ab42f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10795, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "followed his orders without question.** The draconian measures being used, masking, lockdowns, testing of the uninfected, use of the inaccurate PCR test, social distancing, and contact tracing had been shown previously to be of little or no use during previous pandemics, yet all attempts to reject these methods were to no avail. **Some states ignored these draconian orders and had either the same or fewer cases, as well as deaths, as the states with the most strictly enforced measures. ** Again, no amount of evidence or obvious demonstration along these lines had any effect on ending these socially destructive measures. **Even when entire countries, such as Sweden, which avoided all these measures, demonstrated equal rates of infections and hospitalization as nations with the strictest, very draconian measures, no policy change by the controlling institutions occurred. No amount of evidence changed anything.** Experts in the psychology of destructive events, such as economic collapses, major disasters and previous pandemics demonstrated that draconian measures come with an enormous cost in the form of \"deaths of despair\" and in a dramatic increase in serious psychological disorders. The effects of these pandemic measures on children's neurodevelopment is catastrophic and to a large extent irreversible. Over time tens of thousands could die as a result of this damage. Even when these predictions began to appear, the controllers of this \"pandemic\" continued full steam ahead. **Drastic increases in suicides, a rise in obesity, a rise in drug and alcohol use, a worsening of many health measures and a terrifying rise in psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety, were ignored by the officials controlling this event.** We eventually learned that many of the deaths were a result of medical neglect. Individuals with chronic medical conditions, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological diseases were no longer being followed properly in their clinics and doctor's offices. Non-emergency surgeries were put on hold. Many of these patients chose to die at home rather than risk going to the hospitals and many considered hospitals \"death houses\". Records of deaths have shown that there was a rise in deaths among those aged 75 and older, mostly explained by Covid-19 infections, but for those between the ages of 65 to 74, deaths had been increasing well before the pandemic onset.[[69](#ref69)] Between ages of 18 and aged 65 years, records demonstrate a shocking hike in non-Covid-19 deaths. Some of these deaths were explained by a dramatic increase in drug-related deaths, some 20,000 more than 2019. Alcohol related deaths also increased substantially, and homicides increased almost 30% in the 18 to 65-year group. **The head of the insurance company OneAmerica stated that their data indicated that the death rate for individuals aged 18 to 64 had increased 40% over the pre-pandemic period**.[[21](#ref21)] Scott Davidson, the company's CEO, stated that this represented the highest death rate in the history of insurance records, which does extensive data collections", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt:22:0c4815988024", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10796, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__covid-what-is-the-truth", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "dramatic increase in drug-related deaths, some 20,000 more than 2019.

This is of critical importance since the vaccines were supposed to significantly reduce deaths, but the opposite has happened.** Hospitals are being flooded with vaccine complications and people in critical condition from medical neglect caused by the lockdowns and other pandemic measures.[[46](#ref46),[56](#ref56)] A dramatic number of these people are now dying, with the spike occurring after the vaccines were introduced. The lies flowing from those who have appointed themselves as medical dictators are endless. **First, we were told that the lockdown would last only two weeks, they lasted over a year. Then we were told that masks were ineffective and did not need to be worn. Quickly that was reversed. Then we were told the cloth mask was very effective, now it's not and everyone should be wearing an N95 mask and before that that they should double mask. ** **We were told there was a severe shortage of respirators, then we discover they are sitting unused in warehouses and in city dumps, still in their packing crates. We were informed that the hospitals were filled mostly with the unvaccinated and later found the exact opposite was true the world over. We were told that the vaccine was 95% effective, only to learn that in fact the vaccines cause a progressive erosion of innate immunity.** **Upon release of the vaccines, women were told the vaccines were safe during all states of pregnancy, only to find out no studies had been done on safety during pregnancy during the \"safety tests\" prior to release of the vaccine. We were told that careful testing on volunteers before the EUA approval for public use demonstrated extreme safety of the vaccines, only to learn that these unfortunate subjects were not followed, medical complications caused by the vaccines were not paid for and the media covered this all up.**[[67](#ref67)] We also learned that the pharmaceutical makers of the vaccines were told by the FDA that further animal testing was unnecessary (the general public would be the guinea pigs.)

Incredibly, we were told that the Pfizer's new mRNA vaccines had been approved by the FDA, which was a cleaver deception, in that another vaccine had approval (comirnaty) and not the one being used, the BioNTech vaccine. The approved comirnaty vaccine was not available in the United States. The national media told the public that the Pfizer vaccine had been approved and was no longer classed as experimental, a blatant lie. These deadly lies continue. It is time to stop this insanity and bring these people to justice. Footnotes **How to cite this article:** Blaylock RL.

Then two weeks turned into two months, and two months turned into over a full year without in-person instruction. My school serves a diverse population of low-income students in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is impossible to overstate the severity of this disruption caused by school closures for these students, many of whom did not have a computer or internet at home when virtual learning began. Online, my students got only a fraction of the regular curriculum. Kids who had once loved the social aspects of school were left with only the parts of school they hated, and students with disabilities who depended on school for daily living needs were cut off from a vital service. **\"Public health\" and \"the safety of our children\" came to mean students Zooming from homeless encampments, experiencing severe abuse, regressing academically, falling into depression, going hungry, struggling through catastrophic learning loss, and, in the saddest cases, not making it through the year alive.** Despite consistent evidence that schools were not sites of high transmission for COVID-19, many teachers failed to put aside baseless fears about classroom superspreading and rampant infection. As a result, **many of the most vulnerable children in our society suffered outrageous hardships, while their affluent peers attended private schools in person.** We've all been told that school closures and lockdowns were mandated by science, but what if these mandates were immoral? In fact, what", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless.txt:0:54cae5e32488", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10803, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "making it through the year alive.** Despite consistent evidence that schools were not sites of high transmission for COVID-19, many teachers failed to put aside baseless fears about classroom superspreading and rampant infection.

In fact, what if the entire rationale for most restrictions was actually rotten? We're watching the mainstream pandemic narrative starting to unravel. While the Senate and House intelligence committees investigate the origins of SARS-CoV-2, many reporters are openly wondering why they initially dismissed the lab leak hypothesis as \"misinformation.\" Few in media consider the possibility that their approach to the theory was not an anomaly, but rather a long-established pattern of journalistic dereliction of duty. For the public, these renewed questions about the virus (and their hard-to-face answers) speak to a deep sense that something is amiss in the story we've been told by major media outlets. But gain-of-function research is just the tip of the iceberg. A trove of media darling [Dr. Anthony Fauci's emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails) was recently released to the public. The emails reveal early assertions that asymptomatic transmission is rare, that post-infection immunity is highly likely, and that masks are \"not really effective.\" However, you wouldn't know that from the public messaging since the start of the pandemic, in which **bureaucrats and journalists upheld lasting misconceptions that asymptomatic cases are dangerous, natural immunity is not a factor in protecting the population, and individuals are responsible for viral spread.** These misconceptions fueled countless months of lockdowns, business closures, and job losses, pushing millions of people into poverty and despair through the destructive lie that stringent \"sick until proven healthy\" interventions save lives. In reality, the rushed doomsday forecasts and commitment to politically correct pseudoscience prompted leaders to abandon decades of pandemic planning. This not only had disastrous economic consequences, but it also exacerbated the effects of COVID-19 itself. And rather than swiftly correct their errors, public health officials and politicians doubled down, manipulated data, and blamed ordinary people for the failure of nonsensical policies. The uncomfortable truth is that \"The Science\" did not protect vulnerable populations. **Saving Lives or Killing People?** **In December 2020, [35% of Americans believed](https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-misinformation-is-distorting-covid-policies-and-behaviors/) that half of the people with COVID-19 required hospitalization. The correct figure was 1%-5%. Americans also estimated that the share of COVID-19 deaths for people between 18 and 24 was 8%. It was actually 0.1%. These incorrect assumptions were influenced by anecdotes, shocking media coverage, and early projections** like the influential Imperial College model, which threatened that without lockdowns there would be [40 million](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid19-model-predicts-40-million-people-could-die-without-interventions-2020-3) COVID-19 deaths worldwide.

As a result of mistaken prognostications like this, the media compared COVID-19 to the 1918 influenza pandemic, for which the average age of death was [28](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/key-messages.htm#:~:text=During%20the%201918%20pandemic%2C%20the,media%20extensively%20covered%20the%20pandemic.). For COVID-19 the average age of death is [73](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3), and about half of all deaths are in people [80 or older](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/half-covid-19-deaths-80-years-adults/). While the CDC projected a one-year decrease in life expectancy for the U.S. population, the overall decrease in life expectancy was only [five days](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/25/cdc-one-year-decline-life-expectancy-really-five-days/), and the U.S.'s excess mortality [in 2017](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/16/e2024850118) was greater than its excess mortality in 2020. There is no better example of the harm created by flawed simulations, and the subsequent misguided interventions, than New York's disastrous nursing home policy. While Gov. Andrew Cuomo landed a [$5 million](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-governor-cuomos-covid-book-deal-was-worth-than-5-million-2021-05-18/) book deal and won an Emmy for his televised briefings, conditions on the ground for COVID-19 patients in his state were catastrophic. Over [9,000](https://apnews.com/article/new-york-andrew-cuomo-us-news-coronavirus-pandemic-nursing-homes-512cae0abb55a55f375b3192f2cdd6b5) elderly COVID-19 patients were sent from hospitals back to nursing homes. Additionally, Cuomo required group homes for people with [intellectual disabilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-cuomo-cover-up-11614029575) to take COVID-19 patients and attempted to issue a [blanket DNR](https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/ny-issues-do-not-resuscitate-guideline-for-cardiac-patients/) guideline for all cardiac patients in New York City. He also [denied](https://www.mytwintiers.com/news-cat/local/county-officials-claim-cuomo-did-not-provide-desperately-needed-covid-tests-to-nursing-homes/) nursing homes' requests for testing kits, ignored the concerns of families, and gave [immunity](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/andrew-cuomo-nursing-home-execs-immunity) to nursing home executives. This resulted in the deaths of nearly [15,000](https://www.wxxinews.org/post/new-data-shows-nearly-15000-ny-nursing-home-adult-care-residents-died-covid-19) long-term-care patients. These deaths did not occur because Cuomo ignored scientists and researchers. **They occurred precisely because Cuomo was adhering to predictions from his team of experts who projected the need for [140,000 hospital beds and 40,000 ICUs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-covid-models-get-wrong-11592435169). Ultimately, New York's actual bed and ICU use peaked in mid-April at 18,825 and 5,225, respectively. **The deadly decisions the governor's office made were motivated by a perceived need to save resources and space-a manufactured imperative based on fictitious IFR figures and a baseless belief in universal risk. Moreover, although some New York hospitals were overwhelmed, many were not. While Elmhurst hospital in Queens was at full capacity in April, the hospital had 26 new ambulances to take patients to [3,500 empty beds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-hospitals.html) in New York City, many within a 20-minute drive. Because of panic induced by horrific forecasts, New York City doctors cited the need for \"[wartime ethics](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/the-coronavirus-pandemic-peaks-in-new-yorks-hospitals)\" when advising patients and families about DNRs.

These ethical violations were urged on by crazed media coverage and an environment of psychological terror, but they were not justified by the true level of danger involved in treating patients. **Despite concerns about hospital beds and ICUs, [field hospitals](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/07/851712311/u-s-field-hospitals-stand-down-most-without-treating-any-covid-19-patients) across the country remained largely empty, costing taxpayers $660 million despite the fact that most of them did not serve any patients.** Cuomo's nursing home order was replicated by four other Democratic governors, and one-third of all American deaths from the virus are now linked to nursing homes. As a consequence of these practices, New York State has the second-highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the country. **Following the Science** Three of the [top four](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/) states in overall COVID-19 mortality have Democratic governors who \"followed the science\" long after the initial promises that it would only take \"two weeks to flatten the curve.\" Although these states have high population density, density is often associated with [lower COVID-19 death rates](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/urban-density-not-linked-to-higher-coronavirus-infection-rates-and-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-death-rates.html). **After Texas Gov. Greg Abbott lifted all his state's restrictions in April, Texas saw no resulting surge in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. In fact, many states that continued restrictions saw higher cases and deaths than states that lifted restrictions early.** These trends are consistent with dozens of peer-reviewed studies and retrospective analyses indicating that stay-at-home orders [did not](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782395) have an impact on rates of [fatal infection](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext) and that [comparisons](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588) between many countries do not show superior outcomes from lockdowns. Besides hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care settings, [households](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28737/w28737.pdf?utm_campaign=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp%3Butm_medium=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp%3Butm_source=PANTHEON_STRIPPED) show some of the [highest rates](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102) of transmission, while **the share of transmission that has happened outdoors is less than [0.1%](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/briefing/outdoor-covid-transmission-cdc-number.html). **Furthermore, [vitamin D](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vitamin-d-covid-study) and [exercise](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/exercise-may-strongly-protect-against-poor-covid-19-outcomes) have both been linked to better outcomes for COVID-19 patients. **In the U.S. [78%](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html) of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were overweight or obese. Lockdowns caused Americans to gain an average of [two pounds per month](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/health/virus-weight-gain.html) and reduce their daily steps by [27%](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2665?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.** Not only were government orders confining people to their homes highly detrimental, but the early recommended treatment procedures for the virus were often fatal.

Patients were given unusually [heavy sedatives](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-retreat-from-early-covid-treatment-and-return-to-basics-11608491436) so that staff would be able to check on them less frequently. **U.S. hospitals received [$13,000](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/) for each Medicare COVID-19 patient and $39,000 for each Medicare patient they intubated. **These patients were separated from their families and had no one to advocate for them. Many people died after terrified doctors, misinformed about the scale of the risks, used intubation as a way to avoid virus exposure. When lockdowns began, commentators referred to herd immunity as a \"genocidal\" concept that meant exposing vulnerable people to disease. That is actually what happens when natural immunity is prevented. Lockdowns limit and delay the acquired immunity of the younger population, making older people more [vulnerable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652751/) to exposure, especially in the absence of focused protection measures.

Clearly, **quarantining the healthy did exactly the opposite of what was sold to the public: It increased non-COVID-19 excess deaths while leaving elderly and immunocompromised people completely unprotected.** While some may excuse the destructiveness of lockdowns as a simple error, the sheer volume of reversals public health officials have made during the pandemic paints a picture of bureaucrats misleading the public in order to cover up their failures or pursue agendas unrelated to public health. **Moving the Goal Posts** **Experts have taken an imprecise approach to statistics, changed their minds, and withheld information while claiming the mantle of \"scientific consensus.\"** Over the summer of 2020, the WHO quietly changed its definition of herd immunity from protection acquired through both natural immunity and vaccination to one acquired only through vaccination. Similarly, in December 2020, Fauci declared that he was changing his estimate for vaccination rates needed to achieve herd immunity from 60% to [90%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.html). **When asked for a scientific rationale, Fauci said [he changed the percentage](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/12/27/fauci-coronavirus-herd-immunity-range-estimate-shift-intv-sotu-vpx.cnn) based purely on polling that indicated more Americans were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine.** When lockdowns failed to yield meaningful mitigation results, public", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless.txt:4:a60580401d85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10807, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__lockdown-tragic-effects-children-poor-homeless", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "its definition of herd immunity from protection acquired through both natural immunity and vaccination to one acquired only through vaccination.

Although [simulations](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent) suggested that 80% mask compliance would do more to stop the spread of COVID-19 than lockdowns, regional analysis in the United States [does not show](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1) that mandates had any effect on case rates, despite [93%](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201022/mask-use-by-americans-now-tops-90-poll-finds) compliance. Moreover, according to CDC data, [85%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4)of people who contracted COVID-19 reported wearing a mask. Research has shown that once unquestioned rules like [6 feet](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2018995118) for social distancing are arbitrary and not actually associated with lower transmission. Reporting of death and hospitalization rates was also inexact, and mass asymptomatic testing distorted public understanding of the virus. **As a result of testing children hospitalized for unrelated conditions, the number of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations was exaggerated by [at least 40%](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/05/study-number-of-kids-hospitalized-for-covid-is-overcounted.html).** The PCR testing protocol for COVID-19 was based on a paper by Christian Drosten, which was peer-reviewed and published within just two days in a journal on whose editorial board Drosten sits. The method was created \"[without having virus material available](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31992387/),\" using instead a genetic sequence published online. The PCR test amplifies genetic material of the virus in cycles but does not determine whether a case is infectious. A higher number of cycles indicates a lower viral load. The cycle threshold for PCR tests used in the U.S. was usually limited at 37 or 40, highly sensitive levels. In July 2020, Fauci remarked that at these levels, a positive result is \"[just dead nucleotides, period](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE).\" **For vaccinated Americans, the CDC has lowered the cycle threshold for \"breakthrough infections\" to only [28 cycles](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf) and announced that post-vaccine cases will only be counted if they result in [hospitalization or death](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html). CDC Director Rochelle Walensky stated that vaccinated Americans who died and tested positive for COVID-19 merely died \"[with](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cdc-director-walensky-criticism-updated-guidance-coronavirus-deaths)\" COVID-19, not \"from\" COVID-19. This method of tallying would eliminate many pre-vaccine cases. It is also likely that [85%-90%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html) of tests that are positive at a cycle threshold of 40 would be negative at a cycle threshold of 30.** Despite this lack of accurate data, authorities have consistently scapegoated members of the public as \"anti-maskers\" or \"anti-vaxxers\" responsible for prolonging the pandemic.

For the past 16 months, the public has been told that it is our duty to serve the needs of medical institutions and personnel, not the other way around. Effective low-cost therapeutics like ivermectin were dismissed in favor of a vaccine program that transferred billions of dollars from taxpayers to pharmaceutical executives and shareholders.** Critics of measures like school closures were accused of far-right white supremacy, even though these measures were most damaging to working-class people and minorities. **Deadly policies were portrayed as lifesaving, and public health protocols caused immense clinical damage. **A few people have benefited from this war on reality while many have paid a heavy price. \"In 2020, [workers lost $3.7 trillion](https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-lost-37-trillion-in-earnings-during-the-pandemic-2021-1), while [billionaires gained $3.9 trillion](https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/world/billionaires-made-3-9-trillion-during-the-pandemic-enough-to-pay-for-everyone-s-vaccine/ar-BB1d6Gw8) and [493 new billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2021/04/06/nearly-500-people-have-become-billionaires-during-the-pandemic-year/?sh=4ab646da25c0) were minted.

In response, people all over the world are reviving the common good by exposing important information that protects people and the environment from private exploitation. A few weeks ago, I had the meaningful opportunity to attend *Rise and Resist*, the annual [Children's Health Defense (CHD) conference](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2023-conference/) in Savannah, Georgia. For 3 days, courageous thought leaders and whistleblowers within science, law, medicine, and technology came to speak on important issues shaping our lives: medical and government corruption, vaccine injured families and children, chronic health epidemics, environmental toxins, food system solutions, media censorship, and the financial system crisis. The ability to talk openly about these issues is a healthy sign of critical thinking and collective problem-solving. Yet unfortunately, they have had very little coverage in the mainstream press. To [MSN News](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/i-feel-like-i-ve-come-home-today-rfk-jr-speaks-to-crowd-at-anti-vax-conference-despite-claiming-he-supports-vaccines/ar-AA1jIvcb) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-comes-home-anti-vaccine-group-commits-break-us-infectious-disea-rcna123551), the event was labeled as an anti-vax conference and mainly focused on one aspect of the conference: CHD founder and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr.'s speech and his \"[grim comments to strangers](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/i-feel-like-i-ve-come-home-today-rfk-jr-speaks-to-crowd-at-anti-vax-conference-despite-claiming-he-supports-vaccines/ar-AA1jIvcb).\" The conference was nothing like how these news articles were painting it to be. Mainstream media coverage of the event was obviously biased. The issues that were foregrounded threaten official narratives, and they expose harmful agendas of those in power. When much of the mainstream media landscape is [controlled by a handful of powerful elites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgKv8rrqIpU&ab_channel=ENDEVR),[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgKv8rrqIpU&ab_channel=ENDEVR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgKv8rrqIpU&ab_channel=ENDEVR) the narratives that dominate the airwaves tend to be in service of commercial interests. Public discourse has to be narrowed and manipulated, to prevent large-scale inquiry into these corruptions that these corporate elites benefit from. **Here's what actually happened at the conference, and why it matters.** The weekend was rich of legal and scientific panel discussions, peer-reviewed and evidence-based science, powerful human stories, film screenings, [successful CHD litigation cases](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/legal_justice/chd-victories-positive-outcomes-and-groundbreaking-litigation/) revealing undeniable corporate and government harm, and cutting-edge thoughts about the future of healthcare and science. A whole area was dedicated to nonprofit organizations and conscious businesses sharing important resources, services, and products for healthy living and activism. Overall, there was an intellectual sophistication and a cultural, generational diversity that transcended partisan politics.

Kennedy Jr. and CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker. In the book, they compiled over 100 vaccinated-unvaccinated studies comparing health outcomes in both populations. These studies are indexed in PubMed, the National Library of Medicine's vast database of biomedical scholarly research. Interestingly enough, the studies reveal significant increases in office visits and chronic illness among vaccinated children, compared to youth who were not vaccinated. In May of 2017, RFK Jr., vaccine safety activist Del Bigtree, civil rights attorney Aaron Siri, and registered nurse Lyn Redwood met with former NIH director Francis Collins and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the health comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. **The NIH and CDC could not produce any studies comparing vax-unvax studies.

Four months later, the agency denied almost every request. Twenty-year research veteran Brook Jackson was the director of Ventavia Research Group working for Pfizer during the COVID pandemic. She [blew the whistle](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-covid19-researcher-blows-whistle-data-integrity-issues-pfizers-vaccine-trial) on \"poor lab management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues\" at her site. After Ventavia-Pfizer failed to address these concerns, she emailed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a list of a \"[dozen concerns she had witnessed](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635),\" [https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635) including: Protocol deviations not being reported; lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events, mislabeled laboratory specimens, and the targeting of staff for who reported these problems.\" Jackson was fired that same day. A short time later, the FDA gave Pfizer's emergency authorization for its vaccine to be used publicly. Despite Jackson's claims, the FDA only visited 9 of the 153 Pfizer trial sites, before giving Pfizer full approval for its vaccine. Meanwhile, vaccine injuries are not as rare as we're told. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a[voluntary government reporting system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) that only [captures a portion](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-electronic-support-public-healthvaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system) of the actual injuries. **Vaccine adverse event numbers are [made publically available](https://openvaers.com), and currently show 2,543,974 COVID vaccine injury reports, 36,501 COVID Vaccine Reported Deaths, and 211,257 COVID Vaccine Reported Hospitalizations. ** The Children's Health Defense bus [traveled over 50,000 miles](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/press-release/chd-launches-nationwide-bus-tour-collecting-the-accounts-of-people-harmed-by-vaccines-and-covid-countermeasures) in the US and around the world to document countless stories of those impacted by devastating vaccine injuries. Many of these families had healthy children until they received one (or more) of the vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule. In the excellent documentary [*VAXXED II: The People's Truth*](https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/videos/vaxxed-2/)*,* these stories of everyday American people are finally heard and seen. The film also features doctors and scientists who admit that they are not even trained to understand (or even know of) vaccine injuries. Another excellent documentary,[*Anecdotals*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/anecdotals-the-documentary), follows the lives of many people who stepped up to get the COVID vaccine for themselves or the greater good, yet whose lives changed drastically as a result. Instead of having their stories heard and seen, they were discredited and abandoned by the medical system and our media systems. You would think there is accountability and justice for all of the harms that people suffered as a result of getting vaccinated. Yet at the conference, we discussed the political and legal barriers. **In 1986, Congress passed the [National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/national-vaccine-injury-compensation-program/), giving pharmaceutical companies [blanket immunity from liability](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank-vaccine-makers-and-liability-protection-conflicts-of-interest-undermine-childrens-health-part-iii/) for injuries resulting", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption.txt:3:92fc6126b4b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10815, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "changed drastically as a result.

According to Sasha Latypova, a former pharmaceutical industry executive who now specializes in pharmaceutical fraud, **\"Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures show the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and BARDA contracts with the pharmaceutical companies were structured such that these protections weren't required.\"** **Pharmacide: death and injury by Big Pharma corruption.** One new term I learned at the conference was **pharmacide: death and injury by Big Pharma corruption.** This is a word coined by CHD's new initiative, [Reform Pharma](https://reformpharmanow.org/). [https://reformpharmanow.org/](https://reformpharmanow.org/) Guided by a [bold and detailed 10-Point Plan](https://reformpharmanow.org/10-point-plan/), the vision is simple: restore health integrity and medical freedom. In times like these, we need solutions and ideas to bring forth a society of healthy and empowered people. And as CHD President Mary Holland said during the conference, we all have a need to trust authority figures. However, our authority figures have been compromised. **Government censorship is a tool to hide exploitation and injustice. The suppression of dissent creates the \"[illusion of consensus](https://www.illusionconsensus.com/p/exclusive-interview-with-dr-joseph#details)\" in medicine, leading to a society that unquestioningly trusts official narratives at the expense of countless injuries and deaths. **What gives Big Government, Tech, and Pharma the right to censor and ridicule information that opposes their interests? Why do we give so much power to these institutions to the point where they can stifle free speech? What are we to do about what some consider \"misinformation\" today, but not on examination later? If there is any risk to these medicines and vaccines, there must be choice and informed consent-not harsh mandates, censorship, medical gaslighting, and cancel culture. The silencing of alternative narratives weakens our collective muscles to collaborate and solve problems across our differences.** Access to the open flow of information opens up the doors for effective participatory action and public forums of open and fair debate. As Malhotra eloquently stated in his presentation, there's a collective intuitive intelligence that emerges when people speak the truth. Yet the truth must be evidence-based, clear, concrete, and placed in the context of what we care about. ** When Malhotra asked us to raise our hand if we knew someone who died or was severely injured by a vaccine, I looked", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption.txt:4:6cace78da0ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10816, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__new-revelations-covid-vaccines-big-pharma-corruption", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "flow of information opens up the doors for effective participatory action and public forums of open and fair debate.

People had tears in their eyes, as we took a moment of silence. Feeling this together was a profound reminder that we are not alone. The thread of humanity connects us all. Conference attendees had the opportunity to watch a special film screening of *[Protocol 7](https://protocol7.movie)*, a new drama-thriller film by physician and filmmaker Andy Wakefield that is set to be released next year. The film is based on true stories, centering around a small-town lawyer who confronts corporate pharmaceutical fraud when her adopted son is severely injured by the MMR vaccine. It was a poignant and emotionally stirring film that left the whole audience standing in ovation. During the Q&A after the film, the lead actress Rachel Whittle shared her courageous process of taking on this role. She knew that choosing to be in this film would impact her ability to attract other acting opportunities, due to the controversial nature of vaccine issues. Yet I'll never forget what she said with tears flowing down her face. **\"How would I feel about myself if I knew about these harms... and didn't do anything about it?\"** I left Rise and Resist feeling deeply inspired by the collective goodness in the room. You could feel an energy of possibility, strength, and hope in the air. So many of us were touched by the stunning courage of the people that spoke at the conference. In the eyes of the mainstream press (and Wikipedia), these people are villains and \"anti-vaxxers.\" They represent a massive threat to establishment, commercial interests. These people have lost their jobs, medical licenses, and credibility. Yet they have not lost their heart, and their commitment to saving lives through science, advocacy, and litigation. In the words of Holland during the closing session of *Rise and Resist*, **people are waking up and the truth will come out. We will carry this movement for everyone until they can carry it for themselves. **Thank you, Children's Health Defense, for putting on such a galvanizing event.
