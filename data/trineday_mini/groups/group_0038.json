pesticide from our bodies A new study published Tuesday found that after switching to an organic diet for just a few days people could cut the levels of a pesticide linked to cancer found in their urine by more than 70 percent The researchers collected a total of 158 urine samples from four families seven adults and nine children and examined the samples for the presence of the weed killer glyphosate which is the active ingredient in Roundup and other popular herbicides The participants spent five days on a completely non organic diet and five days on a completely organic diet This study demonstrates that shifting to an organic diet is an effective way to reduce body burden of glyphosate This research adds to a growing body of literature indicating that an organic diet may reduce exposure to a range of pesticides in children and adults states the study which was published in the journal Environmental Research Notably the researchers found that the children in the study had much higher levels of glyphosate in their urine than did the adults Both adults and children saw large drops in the presence of the pesticide following the diet change The mean urinary glyphosate levels for all subjects dropped 70 93 percent Despite its small size the study is an important one because it shows people can markedly reduce their exposures to pesticides in food even without regulatory action said Bruce Lanphear Professor of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University Lanphear noted that the study showed children appear to be more heavily exposed than adults though the reason is unclear If the food is contaminated with pesticides they will have a higher body burden Lanphear said Roundup and other glyphosate herbicides are commonly sprayed directly over the top of growing fields of corn soybeans sugar beets canola wheat oats and many other crops used to make food leaving traces in finished food products consumed by people and animals The Food and Drug Administration has found glyphosate even in oatmeal and honey among other products And consumer groups have documents glyphosate residues in an array of snacks and cereals But glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup have been linked to cancer and other illness and disease in several studies over the years and growing awareness of the research has led to growing fears about exposure to the pesticide through the diet Many groups have documented the presence of glyphosate in human urine in recent years But there have been few studies comparing glyphosate levels in

Cancer part of the World Health Organization said in 2015 that researched showed glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen Tens of thousands of people have sued Monsanto claiming exposure to Roundup caused them to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma and many countries and localities around the world have recently limited or banned glyphosate herbicides or are considering doing so Bayer which bought Monsanto in 2018 is attempting to settle more than 100 000 such claims brought in the United States The plaintiffs in the nationwide litigation also claim Monsanto has long sought to hide the

Concerns about the inner workings of the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC have been mounting in recent months amid disclosures of cozy corporate alliances Now a group of more than a dozen senior scientists have reportedly lodged an ethics complaint alleging the federal agency is being influenced by corporate and political interests in ways that short change taxpayers A group calling itself CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity Diligence and Ethics in Research or CDC SPIDER put a list of complaints in writing in a letter to the CDC Chief of Staff and provided a copy of the letter to the public watchdog organization U S Right to Know USRTK The members of the group have elected to file the complaint anonymously for fear of retribution It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders What concerns us most is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception the letter states These questionable and unethical practices threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health The complaint cites among other things a cover up of the poor performance of a women s health program called the Well Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Woman Across the Nation or WISEWOMAN The program provides standard preventive services to help 40 to 64 year old women reduce their risks for heart disease and promote healthy lifestyles CDC currently funds 21 WISEWOMAN programs through states and tribal organizations The complaint alleges there was a coordinated effort within the CDC to misrepresent data given to Congress so that it appeared the program was involving more women than it actually was Definitions were changed and data cooked to make the results look better than they were the complaint states An internal review that involved staff across CDC occurred and its findings were essentially suppressed so media and or Congressional staff would not become aware of the problems The letter mentions that Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro a Democrat from Connecticut who has been a proponent of the program has made inquiries to CDC regarding the data A spokesman for her office confirmed as much The complaint also alleges that staff resources that are supposed to be dedicated to domestic programs for Americans are instead being directed to work on global health and research issues And the complaint cites as troubling the ties between soft drink giant Coca Cola Co an advocacy

coverage One of the world s most powerful food industry lobby groups is rebranding itself to better serve its food industry funders This comes after years of academic articles some of them based on documents obtained by U S Right to Know and adverse coverage in major news outlets made it harder for the group to do stealth lobbying and public relations work for food companies The International Life Sciences Institute founded in 1978 by a Coca Cola executive is changing its name It will now call itself just by its acronym ILSI The global federation of groups also unveiled a new logo and updated website on May 23 and announced a renewed focus on scientific integrity I don t know whether to laugh or cry said Marion Nestle professor of nutrition food studies and public health at New York University ILSI has always claimed to be independently science based but if there were ever any doubts we now know beyond question that ILSI is a classic food industry front group Many investigators have exposed ILSI s behind the scenes lobbying efforts against public health measures that might reduce food product sales she said See the evidence ILSI is a food industry lobby group Shadowy lobby group In an FAQ posted on their website ILSI claims it does not lobby or express explicitly positions on legislation and that its mandatory policy expressly forbids lobby activities of any kind But as the New York Times reported in 2019 ILSI is a shadowy lobby group that shapes food policies around the world often in favor of its corporate funders The Times also described ILSI as the most powerful food industry group you ve never heard of In China for example obesity rates have nearly doubled in the past two decades as junk food has become widely available Rather than rein in the junk food companies China s policies focus on a theme Coca Cola has long pushed encouraging people to exercise more And ILSI was the main organization shaping China s policy according to research by Harvard Professor Susan Greenhalgh an anthropologist who specializes in China the most important science making entity for the processed food industry Coke succeeded in redirecting China s obesity science and policy to emphasize physical activity Greenhalgh reported in a 2021 paper Working through ILSI a supposedly neutral group Coca Cola influenced China s science making and policy making

very complicated operation that in effect allows ILSI to be the most important science making entity for the processed food industry ILSI documents expose lobbying tactics Documents obtained by U S Right to Know described in a series of academic papers co authored by USRTK s Gary Ruskin offer further evidence that ILSI influences research and policy f or its food industry funders promotes advocacy led studies and deploys other stealth tactics to shape scientific evidence and public opinion a bout issues important to junk food and soda companies The documents also reveal that scientific integrity the theme of ILSI s new branding is an area in which ILSI s anti public health work has been most recently successful according to a paper published last year That is also a theme that is directly important to Coca Cola Despite the rebranding ILSI remains a food industry front group that is designed to promote the interests of the food industry said Gary Sacks an associate professor and fellow at the Global Obesity Centre at Deakin University whose research focuses on policies for preventing obesity And despite ILSI s claim to have a new focus on integrity ILSI cannot escape the inherent conflict of interest at the heart of their operating model In particular the objectives of companies that seek to profit from the sale of unhealthy foods are inherently at odds with public health objectives he said Read the academic papers about ILSI co authored by USRTK Pattern of rebranding In the view of Mélissa Mialon an influential food industry scholar and research assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin the ILSI rebrand is an attempt to restore their reputation and move away from that criticism they re facing in recent years But even scarier she said is that they re also creating new organizations like the IAFNS where it will be even more complicated to trace the links with corporations even if these are entirely founded by Big Food etc Announced in 2021 the

Coca Cola states on its website The soda industry is keen on deflecting the conversation away from the well documented negative health effects of sugar sweetened beverages and onto physical activity said Bellatti The messaging comes at a time when leading global health authorities are urging a crack down on consumption of sugary food and beverages and some cities are implementing added taxes on sodas to try to discourage consumption Coca Cola has been fighting back in part by providing funding for scientists and organizations who back up the company with research and academic presentations Pratt s work with the industry appears to fit into that messaging effort Last year he co authored a Latin America health and nutrition study and related papers funded in part by Coca Cola and ILSI to investigate the diets of individuals in Latin American countries and to establish a database for studying the complex relationship existing between energy imbalance obesity and associated chronic diseases Pratt also has been acting as a scientific advisor to ILSI North America serving on an ILSI committee on energy balance and active lifestyle And he is a member of the ILSI Research Foundation

scientific and regulatory affairs leader Alex Malaspina in 1978 ILSI has had a long and checkered relationship with the World Health Organization working at one time closely with its Food and Agricultural Organization FAO and with WHO s International Agency for Research on Cancer and the International Programme on Chemical Safety But a report by a consultant to WHO found that ILSI was infiltrating WHO and FAO with scientists money and research to garner favor for industry products and strategies ILSI was also accused of attempting to undermine WHO tobacco control efforts on behalf

Disease and Stroke Prevention worked early in her career as a senior nutritionist for Coca Cola and later while at the CDC co authored an edition of a book called Present Knowledge in Nutrition as a publication of the International Life Sciences Institute The emails between Bowman and Malaspina showed ongoing communications regarding ILSI and beverage industry interests During Bowman s tenure in May 2013 ILSI and other organizers invited Bowman and the CDC to participate in a project ILSI was engaged in with the U S Department of Agriculture to develop a branded foods database Travel costs for Bowman would be paid by ILSI the invitation stated Bowman did agree to participate and the CDC provided funding at least 25 000 Harben confirmed to support the database project The 15 member

GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know It is presumed by many that science proceeds like an arrow straight towards the discovery of truth without bending due to any economic forces that may bear upon it In fact sometimes the opposite is true Science is for sale Powerful corporations can procure it in many ways some subtle some not But in the aggregate they can have a powerful effect on what is known and what is not known That appears especially true for the agrichemical industry What follows is a discussion of a few ways that science can be swayed bought or biased by the agrichemical industry It is outside the scope of this report to recount all of instances in which these tactics have been used Rather this is merely an effort to sketch the tactics that have been employed by the agrichemical industry 1 Suppression of adverse findings We have already discussed how industry can suppress adverse studies and findings with some examples from the pharmaceutical industry Similar things appear to have happened in the agrichemical industry According to Scientific American In a number of cases experiments that had the implicit go ahead from the seed company were later blocked from publication because the results were not flattering 2 For example University of California Berkeley Professor Tyrone Hayes explains I was approached by the manufacturer Syngenta and asked to study the effects of atrazine the herbicide on frogs And after I discovered that it interfered with male development and caused males to turn into females to develop eggs the company tried to prevent me from publishing and from discussing that work with other scientists outside of their panel 3 Here s another example after Ohio State University plant ecologist Allison Snow uncovered preliminary evidence that a genetically engineered sunflower could make wild sunflowers grow like weeds Pioneer Hi Bred and Dow AgroSciences blocked a follow up study by refusing to allow the team access to either the transgene or the seeds from the earlier study according to a report in Nature 4 It is very frustrating Snow told Nature We want to do good science But this is keeping us from answering questions we want to ask The New York Times reported on how Syngenta stymied the work of University of Minnesota entomology Professor Ken Ostlie Dr Ostlie said he had permission from three companies in 2007 to compare how well their insect resistant corn varieties fared against the rootworms found in his state But in 2008 Syngenta one of the three companies withdrew its permission and the study had to stop The company just decided it was not in its best interest to let", "chunk_id":

the study had to stop The company just decided it was not in its best interest to let it continue Dr Ostlie said 5 In another case university scientists working on a GMO corn variety found that it was decimating beneficial lady beetles that had been fed the corn According to an article in Nature Biotechnology When the researchers presented their results to Pioneer the company forbade them from publicizing the data The company came back and said you are under no circumstances able to publicize this data in any way says a scientist associated with the project who asked to remain anonymous Because the product had not yet been commercialized the research agreement gave Pioneer the right to prevent publication of their results 6 In the realm of pharmaceuticals activists have worked hard to compel industry to produce a registry of all clinical trials to ensure transparency of scientific results As the New York Times explains Until recently the idea that companies should routinely hand over detailed data about their clinical trials might have sounded far fetched Now the onus is on the industry to explain why it shouldn t 7 In particular prospective registration of safety testing is a good remedy to ensure transparency and to prevent suppression of findings of health or environmental risks of genetically engineered food or crops Regarding health or environmental risks there is no compelling reason why the agrichemical industry should be able to keep its research findings secret When human health or the environment is at stake there should be a strong predisposition to transparency and to releasing scientific results published or not into the public domain Currently there is at no registry of scientific experiments on the health or environmental effects of genetically engineered crops So there is no way to discover whether the agrichemical industry has suppressed any other such experiments The record of the pharmaceutical industry suggests that suppression of adverse results is likely to occur in the agrichemical industry Harming the careers of scientists who produce adverse findings We have discussed how the agrichemical industry and its allies have repeatedly attacked scientists who have produced findings adverse to its interests including Tyrone Hayes 8 Ignacio Chapela 9 Arpad Pusztai 10 Gilles Eric Séralini 11 Manuela Malatesta 12

13 Funding shapes what research is conducted The agrichemical companies are unlikely to support research that may undermine their financial interests Meanwhile there is a declining amount of public funds available for agricultural research As Cornell Professor Elson Shields explains In my 30 years as a public scientist there s been a dramatic erosion of public funding And that makes science more dependent on private funding 14 That means less funding for independent studies to assess health and environmental risks of genetically engineered food and crops Supporting academic departments and scientists who produce positive findings He who pays the piper calls the tune the old saying goes According to Food Water Watch s report on corporate funding of university agriculture research Public Research Private Gain by 2010 private contributions supplied nearly one quarter of all agriculture research funding at U S land grant universities 15 Such funding likely brings many benefits to the agrichemical industry For example in a survey of over 3 000 scientists 16 admitted to changing the design methodology or results of a study in response pressure from a funding source within the previous three years Among mid career scientists 21 admitted to this 16 In 2011 a study in the journal Food Policy reviewed 94 articles about health risks or nutritional values of GMOs It found that the existence of either financial or professional conflict of interest was associated to study outcomes that cast genetically modified products in a favorable light and that a strong association was found between author affiliation to industry professional conflict of interest and study outcome 17 This is an old phenomenon in the pesticide industry More than fifty years ago in Silent Spring Rachel Carson wrote that the chemical companies were pouring money into universities to support research on insecticides She asked of academic scientists funded by the chemical industry Can we then expect them to bite the hand that literally feeds them She continues But knowing their bias how much credence can we give to their protests that insecticides are harmless 18 There appear to be many close parallels with pharmaceutical industry because of the size and scope of its grants to academic institutions and individual scientists In her famous essay Is Academic Medicine For Sale then

Journal of Medicine and now senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School Marcia Angell asks Why shouldn t clinical researchers have close ties to industry She answers One obvious concern is that these ties will bias research both the kind of work that is done and the way it is reported there is now considerable evidence that researchers with ties to drug companies are indeed more likely to report results that are favorable to the products of those companies than researchers without such ties That does not conclusively prove that researchers are influenced by their financial ties to industry Conceivably drug companies seek out researchers who happen to be getting positive results But I believe bias is the most likely explanation and in either case it is clear that the more enthusiastic researchers are the more assured they can be of industry funding It is that close and remunerative collaboration with a company naturally creates goodwill on the part of researchers and the hope that the largesse will continue This attitude can subtly influence scientific judgment in ways that may be difficult to discern 19 Financial incentives for scientists encourage positive results for the agrichemical industry If scientists who produce positive results for the agrichemical industry are financially rewarded with grants and other career enhancements and those who produce adverse results are attacked in serious and potentially career threatening ways then this likely predisposes some scientists to work with industry and to produce positive results for them This likely shapes what studies are proposed and carried out what results are published and therefore what is known about genetically engineered crops and the pesticides with which it is grown Positive studies are more likely to be published than adverse ones It is well understood that there is publication bias regarding clinical trials of pharmaceuticals As Ben Goldacre explained it in the New York Times Trials with positive or flattering results unsurprisingly are about twice as likely to be published and this is true for both academic research and industry studies If I toss a coin but hide the result every time it comes up tails it looks as if I always throw heads You wouldn t tolerate that if we were choosing who should go first in a game of pocket billiards but in medicine it s accepted as the norm 20

research on these foods and crops is not truly independent of the agrichemical companies Research findings about health or environmental risks of genetically engineered food and crops would be more convincing if it were fully independent of the agrichemical companies that produce them i e if it were not necessary to receive their permission to study their products As a remedy Scientific American has proposed that Going forward the EPA should also require as a condition of approving the sale of new seeds that independent researchers have unfettered access to all products currently on the market 21 Scientists have criticized the agrichemical industry for denying access to their seeds and crops According to a 2009 editorial in Scientific American Unfortunately it is impossible to verify that genetically modified crops perform as advertised That is because agritech companies have given themselves veto power over the work of independent researchers It is important to understand that it is not always simply a matter of blanket denial of all research requests which is bad enough wrote Elson J Shields an entomologist at Cornell University in a letter to an official at the Environmental Protection Agency but selective denials and permissions based on industry perceptions of how friendly or hostile a particular scientist may be toward seed enhancement technology when scientists are prevented from examining the raw ingredients in our nation s food supply or from testing the plant material that covers a large portion of the country s agricultural land the restrictions on free inquiry become dangerous 22 The agrichemical industry responded to the scientists criticism by loosening some restrictions on research uses of its seeds But some restrictions still seem to remain For example academic scientists still can t perform experiments on seeds before they are released on the market Some scientists are still skeptical of the ways that industry still controls research on their crops According to Professor Elson Shields of Cornell Each company has to decide how many universities to make those research agreements with What justification they have and why they pick one

reviews of genetically engineered food There are at least two prominent cases in which conflicts of interest have marred the outcomes of scientific reviews of genetically engineered foods Twelve days before California voted on the ballot initiative Proposition 37 for labeling of genetically engineered food the board of directors of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science released a statement that genetically engineered crops pose no greater risk than the same foods made from crops modified by conventional plant breeding techniques and that mandatory labeling of GMOs could therefore mislead and falsely alarm consumers 24 However at the time the AAAS board released its statement its chair was Nina Federoff who has close ties to the biotechnology industry For five years she was a member of the scientific advisory board of Evogene an Israeli biotechnology company 25 She was a long time member of the board of directors of the biotechnology firm Sigma Aldrich 26 In her role as science and technology advisor to the State Department and U S Agency for International Development the Pesticide Action Network called her literally the U S ambassador for GE 27 She even endorsed a campaign statement by opponents of Proposition 37 offering that she was passionately opposed to labeling of genetically engineered food 28 29 In response a group of scientists and physicians including many long standing members of AAAS rejected the AAAS statement on GMOs because it tramples the rights of consumers to make informed choices 30 In a similar case a study conducted for the National Academy of Sciences 31 was tainted because the study director Michael J Phillips left his position midway for position at the Biotechnology Industry Organization 32 Phillips later became vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization 33 Environmental and consumer groups also pointed out numerous other conflicts of interest among those who produced the National Academy of Sciences study 34 Like the pharmaceutical industry the agrichemical industry has deployed many tools and techniques to bias science in its favor Given the history in both of these

critics and evade Freedom of Information Act requests for information about publicly funded professors A major theme of the emails and in particular the role of list member Jay Byrne a former director of corporate communications for Monsanto was to identify critics of the agrichemical industry and opportunities to attack them These included Mehmet Oz Vandana Shiva Don Huber Consumers Union and others Another key theme in the AgBioChatter emails is the effort to frame scientific studies that raise concerns about risks of GMOs and pesticides as agenda driven while studies that report positively about agrichemical industry products are pro science Academic industry collaboration According to the emails received to date via public records requests academics agrichemical industry

some news coverage and commentary about our use of the state Freedom of Information Acts to obtain the correspondence of professors who wrote for the agrichemical industry s PR website GMO Answers We re glad to have a public conversation about this topic with the professors involved We believe that transparency and open dialogue are fundamental values by which we must operate in a democratic society and a truly free market To that end I thought it would be useful to explain why we FOIA Since 2012 the food and agrichemical industries have spent at least 103 million dollars on a massive PR and political campaign to deceive the public about genetically engineered foods As the public relations firm Ketchum bragged in a recent video positive media coverage had doubled on GMOs following this PR campaign and it has put agrichemical industry spin front and center in the debate over GMOs The purpose of this PR campaign is to repel grassroots efforts to win GMO labels that are already required in 64 countries and to extend the profit stream from GMOs and the pesticides that go with them for as long as possible not to foster an authentic public dialogue about GMOs This anti consumer campaign has been dirty in more ways than one It has been packed with numerous deceptions and well documented efforts to trick voters In connection with such efforts the Washington State Attorney General is suing the Grocery Manufacturers Association for the largest instance of campaign money laundering in the history of the state At U S Right to Know we believe the food and agrichemical industries must have a lot to hide because they spend so much money trying to hide it We try to expose what they re hiding As part of our effort we made the state FOIA requests to obtain the correspondence of professors who wrote for the agrichemical industry s PR website GMO Answers These professors are public employees They are paid by the taxpayers to work for the public good their university affiliations give them the status of independent experts and they are often quoted in the media as independent experts But when these professors are closely coordinating with agrichemical corporations and their slick PR firms to shape the public dialogue in ways that foster private gain for corporations or when they act as the public face for industry PR we have the right to know what they did and how they did it Through the FOIA requests we are attempting to understand the work these professors did for Ketchum as well as agrichemical companies such as Monsanto Syngenta Bayer BASF

for the public good It is the use of public funds for private gain Federal and state Freedom of Information Acts exist in part to uncover such potential misuse of public funds for private ends We are also interested in failures of scientific integrity To use one obvious example one of the professors whose records we requested closely mirrored industry talking points in an op ed he wrote against GMO labeling for the Woodland Daily Democrat Did that professor write the op ed himself Or was it written by a PR firm hired by the agrichemical industry Repeating industry talking points is not integrity in science in fact it is the opposite We believe that transparency and openness are good remedies for the lack of integrity in science We are glad to live in America where the tools of the

their families to share a Thanksgiving meal this week new government data offers a potentially unappetizing assessment of the U S food supply Residues of many types of insecticides fungicides and weed killing chemicals have been found in roughly 85 percent of thousands of foods tested Data released last week by the U S Department of Agriculture shows varying levels of pesticide residues in everything from mushrooms to potatoes and grapes to green beans One sample of strawberries contained residues of 20 pesticides according to the Pesticide Data Program PDP report issued this month by the USDA s Agricultural Marketing Service The report is the 25th annual such compilation of residue data for the agency and covered sampling the USDA did in 2015 Notably the agency said only 15 percent of the 10 187 samples tested were free from any detectable pesticide residues That s a marked difference from 2014 when the USDA found that over 41 percent of samples were clean or showed no detectable pesticide residues Prior years also showed roughly 40 50 percent of samples as free of detectable residues according to USDA data The USDA said it is not statistically valid to compare one year to others however because the mix of food sampled changes each year Still the data shows that 2015 was similar to the years prior in that fresh and processed fruits and vegetables made up the bulk of the foods tested Though it might sound distasteful the pesticide residues are nothing for people to worry about according to the USDA The agency said residues found in agricultural products sampled are at levels that do not pose risk to consumers health and are safe But some scientists say there is little to no data to back up that claim Regulators do not have sufficient comprehensive research regarding how regular repeated consumption of residues of multiple types of pesticides impact human health over the long term and government assurances of safety are simply false say some scientists We don t know if you eat an apple that has multiple residues every day what will be the consequences 20 years down the road said Chensheng Lu associate professor of environmental exposure biology at the Harvard School of Public Health They want to assure everybody that this is safe but the science is quite inadequate This is a big issue The USDA said in its latest report that 441 of the samples it found were considered worrisome as presumptive tolerance violations because the residues found either exceeded what is set as safe by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA or they were found in foods that are not expected to contain the pesticide residues at all and for which there is no legal tolerance level Those samples contained residues of 496 different pesticides the

States were found including residues of DDT or its metabolites found in spinach and potatoes DDT was banned in 1972 because of health and environmental concerns about the insecticide Absent from the USDA data was any information on glyphosate residues even though glyphosate has long been the most widely used herbicide in the world and is commonly sprayed directly on many crops including corn soy wheat and oats It is the key ingredient in Monsanto Co s branded Roundup herbicide and was declared a probable human carcinogen last year by a team of international cancer scientists working with the World Health Organization But Monsanto has said glyphosate residues on food are safe The company asked the EPA to raise tolerance levels for glyphosate on several foods in 2013 and the EPA did so The Food and Drug Administration also annually samples foods for residues of pesticides New documents obtained from the FDA show illegal levels of two types of insecticides propargite used to kill mites and flonicamid usually aimed at killing aphids and whiteflies were recently found in honey Government documents also show that DEET a common insect repellant was recently detected by regulators in honey and the herbicide acetochlor was found on mushrooms FDA scientists also reported illegally high levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam found in rice according to information from the agency Syngenta has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to allow for higher residues of thiamethoxam permitted in numerous crops because the company wants it to have expanded use as a leaf spray That request with EPA is still pending according to an agency spokeswoman The most recent public residue report issued by the FDA shows that violation rates for pesticide residues have been climbing in

variety of other popular packaged foods QUESTIONS ON CUMULATIVE IMPACTS Whether or not consumers should worry about food containing pesticide residues is a matter of ongoing dispute The trio of federal agencies involved in pesticide residue issues all point to what they refer to as maximum residue limits MRLs or tolerances as benchmarks for safety The EPA uses data supplied by the agrichemical industry to help determine where MRLs should be set for each pesticide and each crop the pesticides are expected to be used with As long as most of foods sampled show pesticide residues in food below the MRLs there is no reason to worry the USDA maintains The reporting of residues present at levels below the established tolerance serves to ensure and verify the safety of the Nation s food supply the 2015 residue report states The agrichemical industry offers even broader assurances saying there is nothing to fear from consuming residues of the chemicals it sells farmers for use in food production even if they exceed legal tolerances But many scientists say the tolerances are designed to protect the pesticide users more than consumers Tolerances vary widely depending upon the pesticide and the crop The tolerance for the insecticide chlorpyrifos on an apple for instance is very different than the amount of chlorpyrifos allowed on citrus fruits or on a banana or in milk according to government tolerance data In the case of chlorpyrifos the EPA has actually said it wants to revoke all food tolerances because studies have linked the chemical to brain damage in children Though the agency has long considered residues of chlorpyrifos safe now the agency says they may not be The EPA cannot at this time determine that aggregate exposure to residues of chlorpyrifos including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other non occupational exposures for which there is reliable information are safe the EPA said last year Dow AgroSciences which developed chlorpyrifos in the 1960s is protesting the EPA efforts arguing chlorpyrifos is a critical tool for farmers In the latest USDA residue report chlorpyrifos was found in peaches apples spinach

levels considered to violate tolerances The EPA defends its work with tolerances and says it has been complying with the Food Quality Protection Act that requires the EPA to consider the cumulative effects of residues of substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity The agency says to set a tolerance for a pesticide it looks at studies submitted by pesticide companies to identify possible harmful effects the chemical could have on humans the amount of the chemical likely to remain in or on food and other possible exposures to the same chemical But critics say that is not good enough assessments must consider more realistic scenarios that take into account the broader cumulative impacts of many different types of pesticide residues to determine how safe it is to consume the mixtures seen in a daily diet they say Given that several pesticides commonly used in food production have been linked to disease declines in cognitive performance developmental disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children there is an urgent need for more in depth analysis of these cumulative impacts according to many scientists They point to the National Research Council s declaration years ago that dietary intake represents the major source of pesticide exposure for infants and children and the dietary exposure may account for the increased pesticide related health risks in children compared with adults With the ubiquitous exposure to chemical mixtures assurances of safety based on lists of individual toxicity thresholds can be quite misleading said Lorrin Pang an endocrinologist with the Hawaii Department of Health and a former advisor to the World Health Organization Tracey Woodruff a former EPA senior scientist and policy advisor who specializes in environmental pollutants and child health said there is a clear need for more research Woodruff directs the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine This is not a trivial matter she said The whole idea of looking at cumulative exposures is a hot topic with scientists Evaluating individual tolerances as if they occur in solo is not an accurate reflection of what we know people are exposed to multiple chemicals at the same time and the current approaches do not scientifically account for that Critics say scrutiny of pesticide safety is likely to only soften given President elect Donald Trump s decision to name Myron Ebell to oversee transition efforts at the EPA Ebell director of the Center",

labeling of foods made with genetically modified ingredients GMOs time is quickly running out for the agribusiness and food manufacturing industries working to block such labeling The threat that ticking clock holds for the food industry was underscored Tuesday in a hastily held meeting of the U S Senate Agriculture Committee With less than an hour of discussion members voted 14 6 to move forward with legislation that would prohibit state GMO labeling laws notably one set to take effect July 1 in Vermont Other states are considering similar laws The measure preempts any state or political subdivision law relating to the labeling of whether food or seed is genetically engineered or developed or produced using genetic engineering and authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations establishing a national voluntary bioengineered food labeling standard The measure also outlaws any express or implied claims regarding safety or quality based on whether food is or is not bioengineered or produced or developed with the use of bioengineering Many of the senators in Tuesday s meeting cited the notion that something had to be done quickly before Vermont s labeling law takes effect We re running out of time said Sen Amy Klobuchar a Democrat from Minnesota She was one of three Democrats who joined with Republicans to vote for the bill She and other ag committee members said the bill needs work compromise before it can pass the U S Senate Sen Pat Roberts a Republican from Kansas and the bill s sponsor has been working with ranking member Debbie Stabenow a Democrat from Michigan to find a compromise that could pass the full Senate Compromise may be hard to come by Consumer advocates for what has become known as the Right to Know movement across the country see labeling on a voluntary basis as little more than a slap in the face to millions of consumers who have concerns about the health and environmental impacts of GMO crops and want to know if GMOs are used in the food they buy and consume And nullifying a law already passed in Vermont only adds to the insult to voters and consumers It is very disturbing that Republicans in Congress while blocking any meaningful legislation have found the time to push a law that deprives Vermont s citizens their right to know about the food they buy and could rescind over one hundred and thirty other state laws on food and seed said Andrew Kimbrell executive director of the nonprofit Center for Food Safety Those who want to see mandatory labeling say that among their concerns about

consumers over the issue only promises to heat up Ironically the food industry doesn t just admit that they fear consumers will turn away from GMO foods if they are labeled the industry embraces that fear as a central theme The Grocery Manufacturers Association a chief backer of the legislation and other food industry backers warn that if labeling is required consumers will turn away from GMO foods in droves meaning farmers who grow GMO crops the bulk of which are corn and soy will suffer and food costs will soar They give little to no nod to farmers who grow a multitude of other organic or conventional crops In a blog published Tuesday in The Hill Lorraine Merrill commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture Markets Food said Mandatory labeling of foods derived from biotechnology will create a skull and crossbones effect on our safe and affordable food supply which will generate or exacerbate fears of advanced genetic techniques If consumers and food manufacturers migrate to more GMO free products food costs will go up The measure now heads to the full Senate where passage is expected to be tricky Sixty votes will be required to overcome a filibuster and both senators from Vermont Sen Patrick Leahy and presidential candidate Sen Bernie Sanders promise to oppose the law The GOP backed bill would move production methods into the shadows and give agriculture a black eye Leahy told The Hil l The legislation undermines the public s right to know Stabenow has been quoted saying that if the law is to pass the Senate it must contain a pathway to a national system of mandatory disclosure that provides consumers the information they need and want to make informed choices A similar measure backed by Republicans was passed last July by the U S House of Representatives 275 150 Only 45 Democrats voted for the bill Kimbrell said on Tuesday that supporters of mandatory labeling would be pushing senators to vote against the bill The

the more than 20 years I have worked as a business journalist I ve always been motivated by a simple premise Knowledge is power and that power belongs with the public The spread of information that people can use to make decisions what to buy what to eat where to invest etc helps support and promote the principles of freedom and democracy I believe That s why the fear and loathing emanating from the food industry over the public s right to information about the food they consume is so hard for me to grasp As we kick off 2016 the leaders of many of the nation s largest and most powerful food companies are doubling down on their commitment to block mandatory labeling of foods made with genetically engineered crops and they are seeking Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack s help to do so The issue has become urgent for the industry as what would be the nation s first mandatory labeling measure is set to go into effect July 1 in Vermont The industry has thus far failed to convince a federal court to block the law s implementation though the fight could go to trial this spring Citizens in many other states continue to try to pass similar mandatory labeling measures A GMO label would allow a consumer to know at a glance information that many consider important Given that knowledge some people might shy away from GMO labeled foods others may not care Some may seek out GMO labeled foods if they feel they provide special value or are helping feed the world as GMO seed developers such as Monsanto Co claim But the public s right to that knowledge to that decision making ability terrifies many in an industry that generates sales of roughly 2 1 trillion annually The fear is so strong that they have enlisted teams of legal and public relations professionals to help try to convince regulators and federal lawmakers to override Vermont s law and prohibit any future laws like it The Grocery Manufacturers Association whose members include PepsiCo Kellogg Co and hundreds of other large food companies leads the charge against GMO labeling saying it would be too costly to implement and is unnecessary because GMOs are proven safe The organization says it is hopeful that compromise will establish a uniform national standard for foods made with genetically engineered crops The group recently put forth a proposed initiative that would add barcodes to products that consumers could scan with their smartphones to access information But whether or not the presence of GMO ingredients would ever be required to be included in that information is unclear Those fighting

than having to use a smartphone app to scan a bar code Agriculture Secretary Vilsack looks set to sit down with representatives from both sides of the issue in January to try to forge a compromise if one can be found Both sides say they are willing to meet in the middle Millions of dollars have been spent lobbying for and against labeling and fighting the issue out in the courts and both sides are weary of the war Details of the discussions to be held are being kept confidential according to some participants to give the process the greatest chance of success As the discussions loom we should not lose sight of the fact that this issue and many others come down to the power of information and the critical nature of who controls that information Those companies developing and profiting from GMOs have the information they need to patent their creations and track where and how they are used Farmers planting GMOs are provided a range of information about the seeds their limitations and their benefits and can easily choose non GMO seeds because varieties are labeled and tracked Systems are in place to allow food manufacturers to know whether or not they are purchasing ingredients

Chassy still writes and speaks often about food safety issues identifying himself with the full weight of the decades of experience earned at the public university and as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health Chassy tells audiences that before he retired in 2012 he worked full time doing research and teaching What Chassy doesn t talk much about is the other work he did while at the University of Illinois promoting the interests of Monsanto Co which has been trying to overcome mounting public concerns about the genetically engineered crops and chemicals the company sells He also doesn t talk much about the hundreds of thousands of dollars Monsanto donated to the university as Chassy was helping promote GMOs or Monsanto s secretive role in helping Chassy set up a nonprofit group and website to criticize individuals and organizations who raise questions about GMOs But emails released through Freedom of Information Act requests show that Chassy was an active member of a group of U S academics who have been quietly collaborating with Monsanto on strategies aimed at not just promoting biotech crop products but also rolling back regulation of these products and fending off industry critics The emails show money flowing into the university from Monsanto as Chassy collaborated on multiple projects with Monsanto to counter public concerns about genetically modified crops GMOs all while representing himself as an independent academic for a public institution A New York Times article by Eric Lipton published last September laid bare the campaign crafted by Monsanto and other industry players to use the credibility of prominent academics to push the industry s political agenda That Times article focused primarily on University of Florida academic Kevin

debate about a lack of transparency in the relationships between academics and industry Chassy has said he did nothing unethical or improper in his work supporting Monsanto and the biotech crop industry As a public sector research scientist it was expected that I collaborate with and solicit the engagement of those working in my field of expertise Chassy has stated Still what you find when reading through the email chains is an arrangement that allowed industry players to cloak pro GMO messaging within a veil of independent expertise and little if any public disclosure of the behind the scenes connections CRITICAL COLLABORATIONS In a November 2010 email Monsanto chief of global scientific affairs Eric Sachs tells Chassy that Monsanto has just sent a gift of 10 000 to the university so the funds should be there He then tells Chassy he is working on a plan for Monsanto and others in the agribusiness industry to support an academics review website that Chassy can use to counter concerns and allegations raised by critics of GMOs From my perspective the problem is one of expert engagement and that could be solved by paying experts to provide responses Sachs wrote The key will be keeping Monsanto in the background so as not to harm the credibility of the information In a separate 2010 exchange Jay Byrne president of the v Fluence public relations firm and former head of corporate communications for Monsanto tells Chassy he is trying to move the Academics Review project forward He suggests we work on the money for all of us Byrne says that he has a list of GMO critics for Academics Review to target He tells Chassy that the topic areas mean money for a range of well heeled corporations In 2011 several emails show Chassy and Monsanto chief of global scientific affairs Eric Sachs along with others discussing ways to lobby the Environmental Protection Agency against expandedregulation of biotech crops In one email exchange from September 2011 Chassy suggests

questions and concerns about GMOs Chassy also has continued to operate Academics Review publishing critical articles about individuals and organizations including the World Health Organization s cancer experts that report information unfavorable for the GMO crop industry I was the subject of at least two such attacks in 2014 Chassy objected to my presentation of both sides of the GMO safety debate in one Reuters article and objected t o a second Reuters article that detailed the findings of a USDA report that found both benefits but also concerns associated with GMOs When asked about its interactions with Chassy Monsanto has said that there is nothing improper with its engagements with public sector experts and that such collaborations help educate the public on important topics The university also has said it sees nothing wrong with the relations A university spokeswoman said Chassy has strong scientific credibility She also said that Monsanto has given the university at least 1 9 million in the last five years But others familiar with the issues say the lack of transparency is a problem These revelations regarding the connections are very important said George Kimbrell

industry In a recent example Chassy has co authored a series of articles that argue GMO labeling is a disaster in waiting again with no disclosure of his collaboration with GMO developer Monsanto His co author is Jon Entine founder of the PR firm ESG MediaMetrics whose clients have included Monsanto a connection Entine does not include in the article The revelations in the emails about Chassy

Hamilton Kennedy and narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson claims to look at all points of view in the debate over genetically modified foods GMOs debate But the film quickly devolves into a hard sell for GMOs based on specious claims and industry sources See below for our June 2019 review Since then many more academics have described the film as propaganda and some people interviewed for the film

by Stacy Malkan Review of Food Evolution By Stacy Malkan 6 19 2017 Some industry messaging efforts are so heavy handed they end up highlighting their own PR tactics more than the message they are trying to convey That s the problem with Food Evolution a new documentary by Academy Award nominated director Scott Hamilton Kennedy and narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson The film opening in theaters June 23 claims to offer an objective look at the debate over genetically engineered foods but with its skewed presentation of science and data it comes off looking more like a textbook case of corporate propaganda for the agrichemical industry and its GMO crops That the film s intended purpose was to serve as an industry messaging vehicle is no secret Food Evolution was planned in 2014 and funded by the Institute for Food Technologists a trade group to culminate a multi year messaging effort IFT is partly funded by big food corporations The group s president at the time was Janet Collins a former DuPont and Monsanto executive who now works for CropLife America the pesticide trade association IFT s President Elect Cindy Stewart works for DuPont IFT chose Scott Kennedy to direct the film but Kennedy and producer Trace Sheehan say they had complete control over the film They describe Food Evolution as a fully independent investigation into the topic of GMOs that includes all points of view The film s credibility suffers from their choice to embrace only the science and scientists who side with the pesticide industry groups that profit from GMOs and the chemicals used on them while ignoring science and data that doesn t fit that agenda The Monsanto science treatment The clearest example of the scientific dishonesty in Food Evolution is the way the film deals with glyphosate The weed killer chemical is at the heart of the GMO story since 80 90 of GMO crops are genetically engineered to tolerate glyphosate Food Evolution reports that the increase in glyphosate

with the journal where it was originally published The Africa needs GMOs narrative In another neatly spun public relations move Food Evolution takes viewers on an emotional journey to the developing world and along another favorite industry messaging track Rather than focus on how genetic engineering is used in our food system now primarily to convey herbicide tolerance and resulting in a huge spike in the use of toxic herbicides we should focus on how GMOs might be used in the future With plenty of airtime and dramatic tension the film examines the problem of banana wilt a disease killing staple crops in Africa and leads viewers to believe that genetic engineering will save the crop the farmers and the community Maybe But the film neglects to mention that the savior GE technology is not yet available and might not even work According to a paper in Plant Biotechnology Journal the resistance shown in the lab is robust but may not be durable in open fields The film is fundamentally dishonest Meanwhile a low tech solution is working well and looks like it could use some investment According to a 2012 paper in the Journal of Development and Agricultural Economics farmer field schools which help growers acquire hands on knowledge of techniques to prevent banana wilt led to lower infection rates and high crop recovery in Uganda Results from farmer field schools have been remarkable according to the UN That solution doesn t warrant a mention in Food Evolution It s fundamentally dishonest of the film to tout a GE solution that may not even work as the scientists themselves acknowledge said Michael Hansen senior scientist at Consumers Union while failing to point out another way to control the problem that works very well but doesn t involve selling a product to make money Did Monsanto cook up the idea for Food Evolution Monsanto and allies were discussing plans for a documentary in late 2013 according to emails obtained by US Right to Know The emails do

would matter more than their money is their participation Von Mogel appears to have played a key role in Food Evolution not only was he interviewed in the film he was involved in filming one scene

Huffington Post By Carey Gillam News Thursday that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts and the committee s ranking Senate Democrat Debbie Stabenow had finally sewn up a deal on

Grocery Manufacturers Association GMA which represents the interests of the nation s largest food and beverage companies and has been the chief architect of legislation to pre empt Vermont s mandatory labeling law said Thursday that it fully supports the terms of the newly proposed legislation Senate Ag Democrats quickly took to social media to try to defend the deal calling it a win for consumers A prior measure pushed by Roberts referred to by critics as Deny Americans the Right to Know Act or the DARK Act was blocked by Senate Democrats in March But consumer advocates who were merely days away from seeing the nation s first mandatory GMO labeling law implemented set to take effect in Vermont on July 1 said the bill was no better than the prior version and they vowed to do all they could to block its passage This is not a labeling bill it is a non labeling bill said Andrew Kimbrell executive director of the Center for Food Safety in a statement We are appalled that our elected officials would support keeping Americans in the dark about what is in our food and even more appalled that they would do it on behalf of Big Chemical and food corporations The chief objection is that while the bill nullifies Vermont s law and any other similar state labeling efforts it also allows companies to avoid the main thing consumers have demanded a fast and easy way to determine if a food product they are purchasing was made using genetically engineered crops To appease consumer concerns about GMOs many national food companies have already started providing simple and clear on package GMO labeling But under the law now proposed food companies could avoid any mention of genetic engineering on their packages and disclose GMO ingredients through digital codes rather than on package

requirement entirely The law provides no federal penalties for violations of the labeling requirements It calls for the USDA to determine the amounts of GMO substance that may be present in food to be considered a bioengineered food Foods that have meat poultry and egg products as main ingredients are exempted And some consumer advocates say that a provision setting a definition of genetic engineering or bioengineering would be limited to such an extent that some interpretations might mean that foods made with herbicide tolerant corn and soybeans the main GMO crops grown in the United States would not be subject to the labeling requirements Consumer groups are vowing to blitz members of Congress with demands that they block the law reminding them that this isn t about politics it s about a consumer s fundamental right to make an informed decision about the food they are buying for themselves and their families Many consumers worry that the genetically engineered crops on the market now carry potential and actual risks for human health and the environment They worry that because most GMO crops are sprayed with glyphosate herbicide which the World Health Organization has declared a probable human carcinogen that GMO foods might contain dangerous levels of that pesticide And they lack confidence in the regulatory and corporate entities that say those concerns are unsubstantiated even though the regulators require no independent safety testing of genetically engineered crops before they are commercialized for food The food and agrichemical and seed industry interests have brushed aside those concerns and have acknowledged that they fear consumers will turn away from foods clearly labeled GMO in favor of non GMO natural or organic products Consumer advocates accused Stabenow of selling out consumer interests to appease food and big agriculture interests such as Monsanto Co the chief purveyor of GMO seed technology But Stabenow defended the deal

the U S Food and Drug Administration found extra genes in the cows that weren t supposed to be there The mistakes that FDA caught but the company missed highlight the importance of government oversight of gene edited foods at a time when industry groups are pushing for deregulation Pork producers for example say the federal government should ease regulations on the use of gene editing in livestock which they claim is slowing down research and development the Wall Street Journal reported last week The producers want oversight moved from the FDA to the U S Department of Agriculture which already allows gene edited crops to be planted and sold with no regulatory oversight But the FDA plans to require pre market safety assessments for gene edited food animals as they do for new animal drugs The regulations will ensure that genetic changes are safe for animals and consumers and help consumers get comfortable with the technology an FDA spokeswoman told the Journal The FDA s discovery of extra genes in the hornless cattle and other recently reported mishaps involving new genetic engineering techniques bolster the case for government scrutiny and have industry groups scrambling to control the public relations fiasco The extra genes Recombinetics missed Researchers at the Minnesota based company Recombinetics Inc reported in a 2016 paper that they created the first polled hornless cows using a gene editing technique called TALENS to alter the gene sequence in the cows The researchers reported finding no unintended impacts They wrote our animals are free of off target effects But when FDA researchers reexamined the DNA this summer using genome sequences that had been posted online by Recombinetics they did find off target effects Two edited cows carried copies of the entire bacterial plasmid used in the editing process including two antibiotic resistance genes in virtually every cell of their bodies The genes don t normally occur in cattle This raises issues of biosafety given that there is a strong global push to limit the spread of genes conferring antibiotic resistance writes Jonathan Latham PhD in Independent Science News It also raises questions about the lack of precision of gene editing techniques and gives weight to arguments for government oversight Plans to breed the hornless cows in Brazil were scrapped after the off target effects came to light Wired reported because regulators there could no longer consider the cows non GMO The FDA researchers said their discovery highlights a potential blind spot in standard genome

DNA damage in human cell lines So how did the Recombinetics researchers miss the unintended DNA integrations we didn t look It was not something expected and we didn t look for it said Tad Sonstegard CEO of Recombinetics agriculture subsidiary Acceligen according to MIT Technology Review A more complete check should have been done he said Wired magazine quoted Sonstegard explaining We weren t looking for plasmid integrations We should have That should have been an obvious place to look says Michael Hansen PhD Senior Scientist Advocacy of Consumers Reports Whether any DNA from the bacterial plasmid used in the gene editing process got picked up and transferred would be one of the first things you would look for if you were interested in finding off target effects Hansen said In his view the fact that Recombinetics missed the problem suggests that they didn t do the necessary oversight That s why we need government oversight including requirements for pre market safety assessments he said Latham a biologist and former genetic engineer also points to recent findings from Japan that he believes may be more consequential than the FDA s findings and have greater implications for the regulatory landscape In a 2019 study Japanese researchers reported that edited mouse genomes had acquired DNA from the E coli genome as well as goat and bovine DNA This stray DNA came from the gene editing reagents the delivery method used to make the edits These findings are very simple cutting DNA inside cells regardless of the precise type of gene editing predisposes genomes to acquire unwanted DNA Latham wrote in Independent Science News He said the findings imply at the very least the need for strong measures to prevent contamination by stray DNA along with thorough scrutiny of gene edited cells and gene edited organisms And as the Recombinetics case suggests these are needs that developers themselves may not meet Next logical step Recombinetics has noisily objected to FDA oversight all along and lobbied the Trump Administration to wrest oversight powers away from the food safety agency according to MIT Technology Review And when Recombinetics claimed in 2016 that its

that finding was immediately deployed as a lobby tool in the campaign against FDA scrutiny In a commentary that ran alongside the company s study five university researchers argued that pre market safety assessments for gene edited food animals are onerous and unnecessary One of the authors Alison Van Eenennaam PhD an animal extension specialist at UC Davis and a leading advocate for deregulation has described FDA s plan to require pre market safety assessments as insane The effects of gene editing are largely identical to natural processes the researchers wrote in their commentary Any off target effects can be minimized by careful design and extensive testing they said noting that the researchers from Recombinetics found none in their gene edited cattle They also claimed inaccurately as it turned out that the gene edited cattle carried the same DNA that has been consumed by humans for over 1 000 years The next logical step they wrote would be to spread the edited genome sequence into global dairy populations The disconnect between the rush to market genetically engineered foods and the need for due diligence to understand off target effects of gene manipulations and their possible impacts on health and the environment has long been a sticky point in the GMO debate For most GMO foods the companies have been in charge of safety assessments all along with little or no government oversight But what incentive do companies have to look for problems Back in 1998 in an interview with Michael Pollan for the New York Times Monsanto s then director of communications was blunt in his assessment of where the industry s interests lie Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food Our interest is in selling as much of it as

December 2024 a panel of arbitrators ruled in favor of the U S and said the U S can compel Mexico to accept GM corn in food products The panel said Mexico did not conduct a proper risk assessment according to international scientific principles The panel did not comment at all on the robust scientific analysis Mexico presented in defense of its position On March 2 the Mexican government published a directive modifying the 2023 GM corn decree to comply with the trade ruling They rescinded three articles relating to imports including the restriction of GM corn in tortillas The revised

edited genes algae engineered to produce compounds that taste like food new genetically modified organisms GMOs made with these experimental techniques are making their way to your dinner plate It s the next wave of genetic engineering or GMOs 2 0 Will we know if they re in our food The new GMO labeling law passed by Congress and signed by President Obama has been widely panned by consumer groups because it allows companies to use QR codes or 800 numbers in place of plain English on labels But even worse news for our right to know what s in our food vague wording in the new law opens the door for industry pressure on the U S Department of Agriculture to exempt many possibly even most GMOs from labeling at all To learn more about GMOs 2 0 and whether these foods will be labeled I spoke with Michael Hansen PhD senior scientist at Consumers Union Q GMOs have been in our food for over 20 years but they have recently been changing Can you describe what s new MH What s new is they are using different methods to cut and change specific gene sequences There are two basic types gene silencing techniques such as RNA interference RNAi that can turn particular genes off and gene editing techniques such as CRISPR TALEN or zinc fingered nucleuses used to cut DNA in order to make small genetic changes or insert genetic material These methods are more precise than the old methods but there can still be off target and unintended effects When you alter the genetics of living things they don t always behave as you expect This is why it s crucial to thoroughly study health and environmental impacts but these studies aren t required Also just because the techniques are different doesn t mean the traits will be The old method of genetic engineering was used mostly to make

are using terms like fermentation derived to describe ingredients made with synthetic biology When you see that term on products or a non browning apple or potato assume that means genetically engineered Congress just passed a GMO labeling law but the language is written in a way that could be interpreted to exempt many GMO foods from labeling Can you explain the problem The first problem is that the law says genetically engineered DNA must be present That means the law exempts highly processed foods such as high fructose corn syrup GMO beet sugar purified oils and some engineered artificial flavors and spices because the identifiable engineered DNA is degraded or removed Whole classes of soft drinks won t be labeled even if they contain high levels of genetically engineered corn syrup Nothing can be done about that now The second problem we can do something about The law exempts foods if the genetic modification could otherwise be achieved via conventional breeding or found in nature It all comes down to how the U S Department of Agriculture defines modification It could be defined in a way that includes nothing though hopefully that won t happen because there would be such an uproar Modification should be defined as specific genetic sequences that are altered If USDA defines it that way these new GMO 2 0 techniques should be covered But that is going to be a huge fight and it could end up that a lot of GMO foods fall through the cracks and don t have to be labeled On the plus side USDA has decided that meat poultry and eggs can be labeled as non GMO if they come from animals that are not fed with genetically engineered foods and they leave it up to an independent third party standard We need to make sure that standard is created in an open transparent manner and consistent with international standards The next step is that consumer groups need to flood the USDA with comments USDA is accepting public comments until Oct 23 and Consumers

the future of our food No I don t think so When you look at the millennial generation there is a sea change in how people view food Previously people asked if it was cheap Now there is a huge interest in how food is produced and where it comes from People are trying to get food as fresh and natural as possible They want food grown more sustainably more locally and in less industrialized conditions This is why we see so many companies announcing they are getting rid of antibiotics artificial colors and ingredients GMOs and other foods produced in industrialized conditions That s why these new GMO technologies may not have a great future most of them are designed for industrial food systems There is global agreement in the World Agriculture Report that industrial agriculture and genetic engineering are not the answer for the future of food The answer is ecologically rational farming systems Biotechnology by its very nature is focusing on one or a few genes or specific traits whereas truly ecological agriculture is focused on whole systems That s the direction consumers want and where we need to go for health and sustainability But ecological agriculture is not something that corporations can easily monetize and not something they can patent and own Companies are pushing GMOs because of the profit margin What in your view is the responsible path forward for genetic engineering Along with hundreds of other scientists and academics I signed the statement No scientific consensus on GMO safety which describes the problems with current regulatory and scientific methods Our view is that decisions about whether to continue or expand genetically engineered crops and foods should be supported by strong scientific evidence of the long term safety for human and animal health and the environment which is obtained in a manner that is honest ethical rigorous independent and transparent Given the uncertain state of labeling what can people do to avoid

forum where consumers can get straight answers from independent experts about genetically engineered foods GMOs and pesticides Some journalists have taken it seriously as an unbiased source But the evidence shows that GMO Answer is an industry funded marketing tool to spin GMOs in a positive light Documents described in this post establish clearly that GMO Answers worked closely with Monsanto now owned by Bayer and other pesticide firms to coordinate pro pesticide and pro GMO messaging Who funds and runs GMO Answers GMO Answers is run by Ketchum public relations firm and is funded by CropLife International the trade group representing the largest pesticide companies GMO Answers was previously funded by the pesticide industry funded group Council for Biotechnology Information which

job GMO Answers was created as a vehicle to sway public opinion in favor of GMOs Soon after Monsanto and its allies beat back the 2012 ballot initiative to label GMOs in California Monsanto announced plans to launch a new public relations campaign to reshape the reputation of GMOs They hired the public relations firm FleishmanHillard owned by Omnicom for a seven figure campaign As part of the effort the PR firm Ketchum also owned by Omnicom was hired by the Council for Biotechnology Information funded by Monsanto BASF Bayer Dow Dupont and Syngenta to create GMOAnswers com The site promised to clear up confusion and dispel mistrust about GMOs using the unedited voices of so called independent experts But how independent are those experts Examples have come to light that Ketchum PR scripted some of the GMO answers that were signed by independent experts Monsanto PR documents also name GMO Answers as a key industry industry partner in the company s effort to defend Roundup herbicides and oppose transparency of industry partnerships with academics and universities Carefully crafted talking points The website hews to carefully crafted talking points that tell a positive

See our fact sheets on the many studies linking glyphosate dicamba and 2 4 D to health and environmental problems On GMO Answers questions about safety are answered with false statements such as every

Huffington Post By Stacy Malkan Our culture is smitten with the notion that technology can save us or at least create great business opportunities Cargill for example is working on a new food technology that mimics stevia a sugar substitute derived from plant leaves for the exploding sports nutrition market Cargill s new product EverSweet uses genetically engineered yeast to convert sugar molecules to mimic the properties of stevia with no need for the plant itself It was developed using synthetic biology or synbio for short a new form of genetic engineering that involves changing or creating DNA to artificially synthesize compounds rather than extract them from natural sources a process sometimes referred to as GMOs 2 0 On June 1 U S Food and Drug Administration cleared the way for EverSweet with a generally recognized as safe GRAS designation Eventually it could be used in everything from dairy to tabletop sweeteners and alcoholic beverages but low or zero calorie beverages are the sweet spot according to Food Navigator And so begins the next new food technology revolution corporations racing to move food production from the land to the lab without laws or regulations in place that require scientific assessments or transparency How will they sell synthetic biology to consumers A big challenge facing synthetic biology is that today s consumers want fresh natural foods with simple clear labels what Food Business News dubbed the trend of the year last year Why would we want synbio foods Eve Turrow Paul a writer and corporate brand advisor asked rhetorically in The Huffington Post Well a few reasons Number one on the list is climate change Climate change is the number one reason for synthetic biology What about capturing the exploding sports nutrition market Therein lies the PR challenge facing new food technologies how to position food products created with strange sounding lab techniques for the purposes of patents and profits as something safe that actually benefits consumers The largest agribusiness food and synthetic biology companies got together in San Francisco in 2014 to discuss this PR challenge Dana Perls of Friends of the Earth who attended the meeting described it as an alarming insight into the synthetic biology industry s process of creating a sugar coated media narrative to confuse the public ignore the risks and claim the mantle of sustainability for potentially profitable new synthetic biology products PR strategists at the meeting recommended avoiding terms like synthetic biology and genetic engineering too scary too

label products We have targeted this space in a completely transparent manner said Steve Fabro Cargill global programs marketing manager The new ingredient coincides with big changes at Cargill After two years of declining profits America s largest private company is repositioning itself to satisfy consumers in Western markets who are shying away from the mainstream food brands that rely on low cost commoditized ingredients that have been the specialty of companies like Cargill reported Jacob Bunge in the Wall Street Journal Consumers want to know what s in their food who made it what kind of company is it are they ethical how do they treat animals Cargill Chief Executive David MacLennan told Bunge With synthetic biology ingredients that could prove to be a challenge When asked exactly how they plan to label EverSweet Cargill communications lead Kelly Sheehan responded via email Consumers should be able to tell the difference on a label between stevia from leaf and steviol glycosides produced through fermentation Stevia from leaf in the US is currently labeled as stevia leaf extract EverSweet will be labeled in the US as steviol glycosides or Reb M and Reb D In the EU the expectation is EverSweet would receive a modified E number to differentiate the two products Sheehan added Cargill is committed to transparency and sharing product information at Cargill com from stevia leaf extract to non GMO stevia leaf extract Confusing Perhaps but labeling decisions may be left up to the companies As with first generation GMOs labeling is not required in the U S although Vermont will require GMO labeling starting July 1 unless Congress intervenes and companies are free to market their products as natural although FDA is reviewing use of that term There are no safety

be shared with the public Where have we heard this story before Proprietary information patents lack of transparency and industry self scrutiny have been the hallmarks of first generation GMOs and the fuel for growing consumer distrust and demands for transparency that have caught the food industry off guard The corporations that profit from traditional GMOs primarily Monsanto Dow and other big chemical seed companies have responded to the backlash as big corporations often do by throwing huge amounts of money at PR operations to attack critics and spin their products as necessary to feed the world The marketing promises have failed to materialize A May 2016 report by the National Academy of Sciences found no evidence that GMO crops had changed the rate of increase in yields and no clear benefits for small impoverished farms in developing countries Nevertheless GMO proponents claim as Bill Gates did in a Wall Street Journal interview that Africans will starve unless they embrace climate friendly vitamin enriched GMO crops Gates neglected to mention that these crops still don t exist after 20 years of trials and promises Instead most genetically engineered crops are herbicide tolerant crops that are raising concerns about health problems linked to chemical exposures These crops have increased sales of chemicals owned by the same corporations that own the patents for GMO seeds an excellent profit model but one that is turning out to be not so great for health and ecology The promise of synthetic biology The same sorts of promises that failed to materialize in 20 years of GMO crops are fueling the buzz around next generation genetic engineering Synthetic biology techniques could deliver more nutritious crops that thrive with less water land and energy and fewer

funded by large food and pesticide companies misleads the public about diet and health according to documents obtained by U S Right to Know IFIC is widely cited in the media as a source on issues related to food and health IFIC and its nonprofit foundation spend about 5 million a year conducting research producing marketing materials and coordinating industry aligned messaging about food health and nutrition Their messages include promoting and defending sugar processed foods artificial sweeteners food additives genetically modified GMO foods and pesticides often relying on industry funded studies IFIC consistently promotes individual changes and personal responsibility as a solution to diet related harms rather than policies to rein in ultra processed food and chemical companies What is the evidence IFIC misleads the public An October 2022 study in Globalization and Health found that IFIC promotes food and beverage company interests and undermines the accurate dissemination of scientific evidence related to diet and health The study was written by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and U S Right to Know Findings include IFIC and its affiliates disseminate a narrow subset of nutrition and health information consistent with corporate interests and in opposition to public health policies associated with improved population health IFIC often engages in consumer preference shaping which includes the use of key opinion leaders and multimedia communications to promote narratives sympathetic to business interests The group also is involved in manufacturing doubt which is using specific evidence and rhetoric to create doubt about negative health impacts of specific foods or food groups IFIC s consumer surveys and IFIC supported academic researchers consistently focus on individual or person level changes to diet and health This individualistic narrative is consistent with those promoted by other health harming industries such as the tobacco and alcohol industries The study concludes that IFIC uses media outlets to preemptively counter information about the negative health impacts of added sugars and ultra processed foods Based on our review of scientific evidence presented to large media outlets by academic researchers on behalf of IFIC there is reason to consider IFIC a purveyor of nutrition based misinformation IFIC and ILSI marketing and science team for food companies A February 2022 study in Globalization and Health written by researchers at the University of Cambridge and U S Right to Know argues that IFIC and its Foundation s communications should be viewed as conducting marketing and public relations for the food industry The study explains how IFIC was established to work closely

Industry By Stacy Malkan For anyone who wonders why consumers aren t inspired to trust the GMO industry consider this bizarre rant from Impossible Foods Chief Communications Officer Rachel Konrad in defense of the Impossible Burger a veggie burger made more meat like via genetically engineered yeast Konrad was upset that a story in Bloomberg raised concerns about the insufficient research lack of regulation and poor transparency for genetically engineered food technologies So Konrad took to Medium blasting critics of the Impossible Burger as anti science fundamentalists and setting the record straight with information she sourced from chemical industry front groups and other unreliable anti consumer messengers who regularly communicate inaccurate information about science Impossible Burger s marketing chief used information sourced from chemical industry front groups to set the record straight Impossible Foods had a chance to blaze a new path of respect and trust they blew it Bloomberg is not a trusted source of reporting on science according to Konrad because the American Council on Science and Health ACSH says so The ACSH is a corporate front group that solicits money from tobacco chemical and pharmaceutical companies to defend pesticides e cigs cosmetics and other toxic products that aren t likely to win over the vegan crowd Instead of enduring the bias of Bloomberg Konrad tells us we should take heart in the rise of Mark Lynas a promoter of GMOs and pesticides who communicates inaccurate information about science according to scientists and food experts Mark Lynas works for the Cornell Alliance for Science a public relations campaign to promote GMOs funded primarily by the Gates Foundation Gates is also an investor in the Impossible Burger The misleading messaging these groups use to promote genetically engineered foods defend pesticides ignore health and environmental risks and silence consumer and environmental advocates goes a long way toward explaining why the GMO industry isn t winning consumer trust Impossible Foods had a chance to turn a new leaf Up to now most GMO foods have been engineered to survive the spraying of weed killing chemicals glyphosate now also dicamba and soon also 2 4 D in what environmental groups call the GMO pesticide treadmill But the GMO industry is changing with the emergence of new techniques such as CRISPR and synthetic biology As one of the first food companies out with a GM food product that may actually offer consumer benefits if one likes bleeding veggie burgers Impossible Foods had the

its GRAS notification were inadequate to establish safety the company withdrew its petition but put the burger on the market anyway That was within their rights but not a way to establish confidence in their product Industry go to scientists vouch for Impossible Burger Another flag The three food researchers who wrote the expert panel report that Impossible Foods submitted to the FDA Joseph

the mantra over and over there are no safety concerns associated with genetically engineered crops That refrain music to agrichemical and biotech seed industry ears has been sung repeatedly by U S lawmakers who have just passed a national law that allows companies to avoid stating on food packages if those products contain genetically engineered ingredients Sen Pat Roberts who shepherded the law through the Senate dismissed both consumer concerns and research that has fed fears about potential health risks related to genetically engineered crops in lobbying on behalf of the bill Science has proven again and again that the use of agriculture biotechnology is 100 percent safe Roberts declared on the Senate floor on July 7 before bill passed The House then approved the measure on July 14 in a 306 117 vote Under the new law which now heads to President Obama s desk state laws mandating GMO labeling are nullified and food companies need not clearly tell consumers if foods contain genetically engineered ingredients instead they can put codes or website addresses on products that consumers must access for the ingredient information The law intentionally makes it difficult for consumers to gain the information Lawmakers like Roberts say it s okay to cloud the issues for consumers because GMOs are so safe But many consumers have fought for years for foods to be labeled for GMO content precisely because they do not accept the safety claims Evidence of corporate influence over many in the scientific community who tout GMO safety has made it difficult for consumers to know who to trust and what to believe about GMOs The science has become politicized and focused on serving markets said Pamm Larry director of the LabelGMOs consumer group The industry controls the narrative at least at the political level Larry and other pro labeling groups say there are many studies indicating that GMOs can have harmful impacts This week t he French newspaper Le Monde added fresh reason for skepticism about GMO safety claims when it unveiled details of University of Nebraska professor Richard Goodman s work to defend and promote GMO crops while Goodman was receiving funding from top global GMO crop developer Monsanto Co and other biotech crop and chemical companies Email communications obtained through Freedom of Information requests show Goodman consulting with Monsanto frequently on efforts to turn back mandatory GMO labeling efforts and mitigate GMO safety concerns as Goodman conducted scientific outreach and consulting on GM safety in the United States

underscore how Monsanto and other industry players exercise influence in the scientific arena of GMOs and pesticides to push points that protect their profits In its examination of those concerns the Le Monde article shines a light on how Goodman who worked at Monsanto for seven years before moving to the public university in 2004 came to be named associate editor of the scientific journal Food and Chemical Toxicology FCT to oversee GMO related research reports Goodman s naming to the FCT editorial board came shortly after the journal angered Monsanto with the 2012 publication of a study by French biologist Gilles Eric Séralini that found GMOs and Monsanto s glyphosate herbicide could trigger worrisome tumors in rats After Goodman joined the FCT editorial board the journal retracted the study in 2013 It was later republished in a separate journal Critics at the time alleged the retraction was tied to Goodman s appointment to the journal s editorial board Goodman denied any involvement in the retraction and resigned from FCT in January 2015 The Le Monde report cited email communications obtained by the U S consumer advocacy group U S Right to Know which I work for The emails obtained by the organization show Goodman communicating with Monsanto about how best to criticize the Séralini study shortly after it was released pre print in September 2012 In a Sept 19 2012 email Goodman wrote to Monsanto toxicologist Bruce Hammond When you guys have some talking points or bullet analysis I would appreciate it Emails also show that FCT Editor in Chief Wallace Hayes said Goodman started serving as associate editor for FCT by Nov 2 2012 the same month the Séralini study was published in print even though Goodman was later quoted saying that he was not asked to join FCT until January 2013 In that email Hayes asked Monsanto s Hammond to act as a reviewer for certain manuscripts submitted to the journal Hayes said the request for Hammond s help was also on behalf of Professor Goodman The email communications show numerous interactions between Monsanto officials and Goodman as Goodman worked to deflect various criticisms of GMOs The emails cover a range of topics

companies that makes up roughly half of Goodman s salary Indeed an October 2012 email exchange shows that around the time Goodman was signing on to the FCT journal and criticizing the Seralini study Goodman was also expressing concern to his industry funders about protecting his income stream as a soft money professor In an October 6 2014 email Goodman wrote to Monsanto Food Safety Scientific Affairs Lead John Vicini to say that he was reviewing an anti paper and hoped for some guidance The paper in question cited a 2014 report from Sri Lanka about a possible exposure correlation and a proposed mechanism for glyphosate toxicity related to kidney disease Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup herbicide and is used on Roundup Ready genetically engineered crops The World Health Organization in 2015 said glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen after several scientific studies linked it to cancer But Monsanto maintains glyphosate is safe In the email to Vicini Goodman said he did not have the expertise needed and asked for Monsanto to provide some sound scientific arguments for why this is or is not plausible The emails show other examples of Goodman s deference to Monsanto As the Le Monde article points out In May 2012 after the publication of certain comments by Goodman in an article on a website affiliate with the celebrity Oprah Winfrey Goodman is confronted by a Monsanto official for leaving a reader thinking that we really don t know enough about these products to say if they are safe Goodman then wrote to individuals at Monsanto DuPont Syngenta BASF and Dow and Bayer and apologized to you and all of your companies s aying he was misquoted and misunderstood Later in one July 30 2012 email Goodman notified officials at Monsanto Bayer DuPont Syngenta and BASF that he has been asked to do an interview with National Public Radio about whether or not there is a relationship between GMO crops and increasing food allergies In an Aug 1 2012 reply an official at Bayer offered him free media training before his interview The emails also show Goodman s collaborative work with Monsanto to try to defeat GMO labeling efforts In one

Senate and the House and his hope that the labeling campaigns fail The emails also make clear that Goodman depends heavily on financial support from St Louis based Monsanto and other biotech agricultural companies who provide funding for an Allergen Database overseen by Goodman and run through the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program at the University of Nebraska A look at the sponsorship agreement for the allergen database for 2013 showed that each of six sponsoring companies were to pay roughly 51 000 for a total budget of 308 154 for that year Each sponsor then can contribute their knowledge to this important process the agreement stated From 2004 2015 along with Monsanto the sponsoring companies included Dow AgroSciences Syngenta DuPont s Pioneer Hi Bred International Bayer CropScience and BASF One 2012 invoice to Monsanto for the Food Allergen Database requested payment of 38 666 50 The purpose of the database is aimed at assessing the safety of proteins that may be introduced into foods through genetic engineering or through food processing methods The potential for unintended allergens in some genetically engineered foods is one of the common fears expressed by consumer groups and some health and medical experts In comments on the House floor Rep Jim McGovern D Mass said the QR codes were a gift to a food industry seeking to hide information from consumers The law is not what s in the interest of the American consumer but what a few special interests want he said Every American has a fundamental right to know what s in the

fact that it negates the type of transparency consumers seek just a few simple words if a product is made with genetic engineering Hiding behind a QR code does not inspire confidence First published

outreach efforts and that he had received research money from a small biotech firm Kloor decided on a bio that avoided mentioning Dr Folta s industry funding entirely his research is sponsored by federal and state agencies Kloor provided guidance to Dr Folta about how to write the letter to Nye Around the same time Monsanto was also lobbying Nye to change his position on GMOs which they eventually succeeded in doing A March 2015 Washington Post story about Nye s conversion claimed that Nye s criticisms of GMOs had angered many scientists but the only evidence the article provided to support that claim was a link to Dr Folta s open letter published on Keith Kloor s Discover blog Mother Jones coverage of Nye s conversion on GMOs Discover Not our policy to prompt sources Emails from August 2014 show Kloor offering messaging advice to Dr Folta and another source Dr Karl Haro von Mogel the media director of the GMO promotion group Biofortified Kloor asked them to critique an article by Carole Bartolotto a dietician who had written critically about GMOs The emails show that Kloor edited the comments and suggested ways to strengthen the messaging My advice keep the language

Holmes reported The campaign would counter criticism that biotech foods were unsafe by emphasizing the extensive testing of biotech foods and would be structured so as to answer questions and concerns from the public and respond to misinformation and scare tactics by biotechnology opponents Holmes noted He explained that the information would be made available to the public not only by the biotechnology industry but through a variety of academic scientific government and independent third party sources The two decade evolution of CBI also highlights the consolidation of power in the

Friday February 20 2015 For More Information Contact Stacy Malkan Stacy usrighttoknow wpenginepowered com Media Reports That GMO Science Is Settled Are Flat Out Wrong In the wake of prominent media reports about supposed scientific agreement on the safety of genetically engineered food including a cover story in National Geographic that equates concerns about GMOs with climate change denial U S Right to Know is calling on media to accurately report that the science on GMOs is contradictory unsettled and has been largely controlled by corporations that profit from GMO seeds and the pesticides that go with them Unfortunately many members of the media and even some scientists have been snookered by PR firms about a supposed scientific consensus on GMOs that doesn t exist said Stacy Malkan media director of U S Right to Know Seedy Business a recent report by U S Right to Know outlines how agrichemical firms have spent more than 100 million since 2012 on political and PR campaigns to shift the media narrative on GMOs In a video removed from the Internet the public relations firm Ketchum bragged about doubling positive media coverage on GMOs For an accurate picture of the science U S Right to Know urged journalists to read a January 24 statement published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe signed by 300 scientists physicians and scholars that asserts there is no scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs The claim of scientific consensus on GMOs frequently repeated in the media is an artificial construct that has been falsely perpetuated the peer reviewed statement said Entitled No Scientific Consensus on GMO Safety the statement does not take a position on whether GMOs are unsafe or safe Rather it cites a concerted effort by GMO seed developers and some scientists commentators and journalists to construct the claim that there is a scientific consensus on GMO safety and that debate on the topic is over That claim is misleading and misrepresents or outright ignores the currently available scientific evidence and the broad diversity of scientific opinions among scientists on this issue according to the statement The statement raises the following points in objection to the consensus of safety claim There is no consensus in the science A comprehensive review of peer reviewed GMO animal feeding studies found roughly an equal number of research groups raising concerns about genetically engineered foods and those suggesting GMOs were as safe and nutritious as conventional foods The review also found that most studies finding GMOs

have been eaten with no ill effects have no scientific basis Without such studies which have been used to determine the effects of factors from fats to smoking it is not possible to know whether GMOs are causing harm such as increases in known diseases especially over the long term GMO studies are frequently mischaracterized as showing safety For example the EU Research Project which has been internationally cited as providing evidence of GMO safety was not designed to test safety and provides no reliable evidence of safety Another example is the false claim that hundreds of studies listed on the biotechnology website Biofortified demonstrate GMO safety in fact many of the studies on that list do not address safety concerns at all and several of the studies raise serious concerns International agreements show widespread recognition of risks posed by GMO foods and crops The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and UN s Codex Alimentarius share a precautionary approach to GMO crops and foods in that they agree that genetic engineering differs from conventional breeding and that safety assessments should be required before GM organisms are used in food or released into the environment Claims that government and scientific organizations endorse safety are often exaggerated or inaccurate For example an expert panel of the Royal Society of Canada said it is scientifically unjustifiable to presume that GM foods are safe without rigorous scientific testing A report by the British Medical Association concluded that many unanswered questions remain about the long term effects of GMOs on human health and the environment and that safety concerns cannot as yet be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available Moreoever the positions of some prominent scientific organizations have been misrepresented or opposed by members further highlighting the lack of consensus among scientists There is no consensus on environmental impacts of GMOs and

effectiveness of popular genetically engineered traits used to protect corn and cotton from insects is failing putting U S corn production potential in jeopardy and spurring a need for increased insecticide use The study authored by a trio of independent researchers documents resistance in a major crop pest called corn earworm and adds to warnings that the popular GMO insect resistant technology known as Bt after the soil dwelling bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis has lost its luster It is noteworthy as the first long term in field assessment of transgenic Bt corn s effectiveness against one of the most damaging pests of sweet corn field corn cotton and many other high value crops Before publishing their findings which cover 20 years of observations the researchers presented them to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA as well as to the corporations that developed and market the traits said Galen Dively a University of Maryland entomologist and lead researcher on the study Crops engineered with Bt genes express specific proteins known as Cry proteins that make the crops toxic to specific insects the plants effectively provide their own insecticide reducing the need for chemical applications In 2015 more than 80 percent of the U S corn crop carried at least one Bt trait Much of the corn now planted is engineered with multiple Bt Cry proteins but the new research indicates that the insect called earworm in corn but bollworm in cotton is now able to survive multiple genetically engineered traits in a pyramided variety Other research has shown wide failure of traits supposed to protect against the western corn rootworm as well leaving farmers facing big and potentially costly problems as resistance builds according to the researchers With widespread use of genetically engineered crops the targeted insects developing resistance to these protein is a major threat to the sustainability of the Bt technology researcher Dilip Venugopal wrote in a summary of the group s findings Increasing damages by corn earworm to Bt field corn are reported already in North Carolina and Georgia and corn earworm could become a major pest We predict that corn earworm resistance to the Cry toxins is likely to increase and spread Therefore the risk of damage to corn production across a large portion of U S is high Venugopal is a science and technology policy fellow working with a division of the EPA The research adds to evidence that after 20 years of use of crops engineered to tolerate herbicides and resist certain harmful insects both

years Last summer scientists published research documenting increasing western corn rootworm resistance to the Bt proteins and widespread corn damage was reported by farmers Farmers are using more herbicides to try to control resistant weeds and returning to insecticide use to combat the resistant pests agricultural experts say Fred Gould an entomologist at North Carolina State University said the Dively work is a very important study that does not bode well for future crop health And University of Minnesota Extension Entomologist William Hutchinson said the study demonstrates a need for better monitoring of resistance in traits that still work As the study showed there is still very good effectiveness with varieties that contain both Vip3A Cry1Ab he pointed out One key misstep has been reliance on the refuge in a bag RIB system that allowed farmers to avoid setting aside part of their fields as areas free of the Bt trait a practice proven to discourage resistance With the RIB system however researchers have found that farmers actually encouraged resistance by spreading uneven low doses of the Bt toxin to feeding insects throughout their fields which helped build up resistance in the insects over time The companies behind the Bt traits have encouraged refuge in a bag Seed giant Monsanto Co which made 5 8 billion in sales of corn seeds and traits last year has touted refuge in a bag as fast and convenient for farmers allowing them to plant the specialized seed fence row to fence row The EPA shoulders a good deal of the blame for the problem according to the agency s Office of Inspector General OIG which criticized the agency last year for its handling of the resistance issues Among other missteps the agency has been too reliant on the seed and chemical

here for the first time in English underpins Mexico s 2023 decree to restrict the use of GM corn in tortillas and other minimally processed corn products and to phase out the use of glyphosate The U S challenged those policies as unfair trade practice under the U S Mexico Canada Agreement USMCA A decision in that case is expected imminently Whatever the ruling Mexico s new President Claudia Sheinbaum has said her government will not allow the cultivation of GM corn Sheinbaum also recently announced plans to try to place GM corn restrictions in Mexico s constitution this is the best defense we have for biodiversity as well as for our health she said Mexico s stand for food sovereignty and the scientific evidence they gathered to support their case have worldwide relevance as nations across the Global South grapple with seed laws that would open the doors to GM foods It also comes at a time when U S consumers are losing faith in the safety of our food supply according to a recent Gallup poll 21st century science review The CONAHCYT report and related scientific analyses submitted to the trade tribunal are among the most thorough reviews to date of the current scientific evidence on the health risks of GM corn and glyphosate CONAHCYT did an exhaustive review of the scientific literature explained María Elena Àlvarez Buylla who was head of CONAHCYT until last month and who led the effort to review the scientific evidence behind Mexico s corn policy She is an award winning molecular geneticist and a widely published professor of molecular genetics epigenetics and development at Mexico s National Autonomous University We concluded that the evidence was more than sufficient to restrict out of precaution the use of GM corn and its associated agro chemical glyphosate in the country s food supply chains Àlvarez Buylla said in an interview with U S Right to Know The scientific studies Mexico references show very clearly the risks of GM corn planting and consumption in tortillas and masa Alvarez Bullya said We have to remember that in Mexico we consume directly much more corn than anywhere in the world from half a kilo to a kilo a day The CONAHCYT science report is excellent and brilliantly laid out said Michael Hansen senior scientist of advocacy at Consumers Union It s so far superior to anything the U S has put out it", "chunk_id":

said Research has not proven that GM corn is harmful to health but new science is pointing to the potential for health impacts that must be taken seriously and investigated says Hansen Taken as a whole it s clear that you cannot say this GM corn is safe Hansen said U S safety assessments for GM foods and glyphosate are based on science from decades ago he said the U S is using 20th century science and here we have 21st century science Glyphosate health risks Multiple lines of evidence link glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides with a range of health effects including liver and kidney damage reproductive problems microbiome disruption and cancer among other problems Evidence includes recently published long term epidemiological studies many well controlled animal studies robust exposure data and new techniques in the field of omics that enable researchers to study large scale biological datasets to understand interactions and functions of molecules in living systems Mexico s report presents dozens of studies from peer reviewed scientific journals that link a wide range health effects to consumption of GM corn and exposure to glyphosate residues that often come with it since 80 of U S corn is sprayed with glyphosate based herbicides The U S declined to challenge Mexico s glyphosate restrictions in the trade complaint it filed against the GM corn restrictions Litigation in the U S has established a clear link between glyphosate based herbicides and non Hodgkin lymphoma with Bayer now liable for more than 11 billion in damages Most of the damage awards have been for those directly exposed to glyphosate based herbicides landscapers farmworkers and even home gardeners who applied it But the scientific literature Mexico cites offers multiple lines of evidence that the health risks go beyond non Hodgkin lymphoma and suggest the low level presence in residues found on food is a cause for concern especially for people who consume large amounts of unprocessed corn For example the report cites a large body of evidence that consistently links glyphosate to liver problems including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD a disease that is rising in

to cancer adverse early neurodevelopment lower birth weight and reproductive birth effects effects that also show up in lab animals exposed to glyphosate Independent studies raise concerns about Bt corn On GM corn the biggest risk factor identified in the scientific literature is from Bt corn the GM varieties engineered to include proteins from the Bt bacterium which are toxic to the European corn borer and similar insects By inserting the Bt toxin this insecticide remains present in all parts of the plant including the kernels of corn when they are harvested The insecticide operates by damaging the GI tract of the target insects when they consume the plant in the field and the concern is that it might also have deleterious effects on non target animals including humans The U S bases its safety assurances on studies commissioned by companies concluding that GM corn is substantially equivalent to regular corn and that there is no proof of harm Animal studies conducted by independent scientists have however linked GM corn to a range of health effects including effects on male fertility immunological alterations kidney and liver toxicity and damage to the digestive system liver and pancreas The health concerns are significant for a population that eats such high levels of minimally processed corn according to Michael Antoniou professor of molecular genetics and toxicology at King s College London who submitted expert testimony to the USCMA on the evidence raising health concerns Antoniou describes a large body of evidence from well controlled laboratory animal toxicity studies that show evidence of harm to multiple physiological systems from toxic agents found in GM corn These include Bt VIP vegetative insecticidal proteins some of which are known to be highly immunogenic A consumer of U S corn is likely to be eating multiple Bt VIP toxin proteins as well as the residues of multiple herbicides and other pesticides Antoniou wrote In an interview

itself pesticide residues disturbances to biochemistry from the GM process itself DNA damage or a combination of factors it is not possible to tell Antoniou said But his report points to many studies showing major compositional differences between GM and non GM crop varieties that demonstrate that the GM transformation process can result in unintended compositional changes at both a protein and metabolite level stemming from the DNA damaging effects of this procedure He concludes the consumption of imported U S GM corn at the high levels typical for Mexican citizens has the potential to result in serious negative health outcomes To further complicate the picture of risk GM corn varieties now have stacked transgenic traits meaning companies are adding several herbicide tolerant genes and Bt insecticidal genes into one corn plant New data submitted to the USCMA by Friends of the Earth USA reports that GM plants are now showing a much higher concentration of Bt toxins that raise health concerns The first GM corn varieties in the late 1990s expressed 2 ppm to 6 ppm parts per million of one or two Bt toxins in corn kernels the part of the plant people eat explained Charles Benbrook one of the authors of the submission Today s leading GM corn varieties express four to seven toxins in corn kernels and at much higher levels 50 ppm to 100 ppm Why the big increase Because target insects become more tolerant to Bt toxins over time and eventually fully resistant This forces the seed biotech industry to add in new GM toxins and engineer the plants to express them at much higher levels That might help kill more insects for a short time but it also steadily increases human food safety risks U S scientific arguments Importantly Mexico invoked the precautionary principle

process the U S government had the opportunity to rebut Mexico s arguments That would have been an opportunity to examine the scientific evidence and refute it with evidence of flaws in the studies Mexico cited or that called their conclusions into question Instead the U S government largely reiterated its existing evidence base None of the studies on glyphosate were even acknowledged by the U S much less rebutted In its rebuttal the U S included a science annex that counters specific studies cited by Mexico in mostly a few sentences The Mexican government s responses offered detailed point by point critiques of the U S responses Victor Suárez Mexico s then Undersecretary of Agriculture told Reuters in March To this day we have not seen any scientific studies that have been presented by the U S and the companies on the safety of continued consumption over years So there is no scientific basis for the U S and the companies to claim that their corn is safe In the view of the Mexican officials the U S has the burden of proof to show its GM corn is safe and they have not done so The research on the part of the U S was quite poor said Alvarez Bullya the former CONAHCYT director The U S rebuttal did not have up to date scientific evidence Their scientific annexes ignored many of the studies dismissing independent science and continuing to cite science that is full of conflicts of interest Prof Michael Antoniou a molecular biologist and toxicologist with an extensive publishing record concurs that the U S case is weak and based on outdated science He said Mexico s case for

genetically modified organisms GMOs millions go hungry Reducing food waste addressing inequality and shifting to agroecological farming methods not GMOs are the keys to world food security according to experts at the United Nations Most genetically engineered foods on the market today have no consumer benefits whatsoever they are engineered to survive pesticides and have greatly accelerated the

those benefits have failed to materialize Vitamin A enhanced Golden Rice for example the rice that could save a million kids a year reported Time magazine 17 years ago is not on the market despite millions spent on development If golden rice is such a panacea why does it flourish only in headlines far from the farm fields where it s intended to grow asked Tom Philpott in Mother Jones article titled WTF Happened to Golden Rice The short answer is that the plant breeders have yet to concoct varieties of it that work as well in the field as existing rice strains When you tweak one thing in a genome such as giving rice the ability to generate beta carotene you risk changing other things like its speed of growth Nature is complex in other words and genetic engineering can produce unexpected results Consider the case of the Impossible Burger The plant based burger that bleeds is made possible by genetically engineering yeast to resemble leghemoglobin a substance found in soybean plant

safety risks As The New York Times reported the burger s secret sauce highlights the challenges of food tech The story was based on documents obtained by ETC Group and Friends of the Earth under a Freedom of Information Act request documents the company probably hoped would never see the light of day When Impossible Foods asked the Food and Drug Administration to confirm its GMO ingredient was generally recognized as safe GRAS the Times reported the agency instead expressed concern that it has never been consumed by humans and may be an allergen FDA officials wrote in notes describing a 2015 call with the company FDA stated that the current arguments at hand individually and collectively were not enough to establish the safety of SLH for consumption But as the Times story explained the FDA did not say the GMO leghemoglobin was unsafe and the company did not need the approval of FDA to sell its burger anyway The arguments presented did not establish safety FDA So Impossible Burger is on the market with the company s assurances of safety and most consumers are in the dark about what s in it While the GMO process is explained on the website it is not marketed that way at the point of sale On a recent visit to a Bay Area restaurant that sells the Impossible Burger a customer asked if the burger was genetically modified He was inaccurately told no Lack of government

Some synthetic biology products depend on sugar from chemical intensive monocultures or other polluting feedstocks such as fracked gas There are also concerns that engineered algae could escape into the environment and become living pollution And what is the impact on farmers who depend on sustainably grown crops Farmers around the world are worried that lab grown substitutes falsely marketed as natural could put them out of business For generations farmers in Mexico Madagascar Africa and Paraguay have cultivated natural and organic vanilla shea butter or stevia In Haiti the farming of vetiver grass for use in high end perfumes supports up to 60 000 small growers helping to bolster an economy ravaged by earthquake and storms Does it make sense to move these economic engines to South

different doesn t mean the traits will be Dr Hansen pointed out The old method of genetic engineering was used mostly to make plants resist herbicides and increase sales of herbicides The new gene

advocating for the proliferation and deregulation of genetically engineered foods As president and board chair of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS from 2011 2013 she used her position to advance policy objectives of the pesticide and biotechnology industries In 2015 Dr Fedoroff became a senior science advisor at OFW Law a lobbying firm whose clients have included Syngenta and the Council for Biotechnology Information a trade group representing the world s largest pesticide companies From 2007 2010 Dr Fedoroff served as science and technology advisor to the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID under the George W Bush and Obama administrations Prior to that she was a board member of the Sigma Aldrich Corporation a multinational chemical and biotech firm and an advisory board member of Evogene a biotechnology company that partnered with DuPont Syngenta Bayer and Monsanto As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s science czar Dr Fedoroff served as diplomat for the GMO all the way thrust of U S foreign policy Tom Philpott reported in Grist Pesticide Action Network of North America has described Dr Fedoroff as literally the U S ambassador for genetic engineering According to Greenpeace Dr Fedoroff has been a fervent advocate for the global proliferation of GM genetically modified foods throughout her career During her tenure as president and chairman of AAAS the world s largest multidisciplinary scientific society Dr Fedoroff leveraged those roles to provide political aid to the agrichemical industry for example the AAAS Board of Directors under her chairmanship issued a statement to oppose GMO labeling in advance of a state vote on the issue in 2012 While president of the AAAS in 2011 Dr Fedoroff helped defeat a U S EPA proposal that would have required additional health and safety data for GMO crops according to emails described below Dr Fedoroff and AAAS have not responded to requests for comment Affiliations with deceptive industry front groups and PR efforts Dr Fedoroff has promoted and helped to legitimize groups that claim to be independent voices for science but work behind the scenes with the agrichemical industry in ways that mislead the public including two groups that helped Monsanto try to discredit the scientists who served on the World Health Organization s International Agency for

Review as a trustworthy science source in a 2012 article in Trends in Genetics and a 2016 interview with the Washington Examiner about poor science journalism Documents obtained by U S Right to Know show that Academics Review was set up as a front group with the help of Monsanto to discredit critics of genetic engineering and pesticides while keeping corporate fingerprints hidden The group which

investigation to uncover undisclosed industry academic conflicts of interest was taking a page out of the Climategate playbook and involved science denialism the same claims made by industry PR groups described in this fact sheet AAAS helped persuade voters to oppose GMO labeling In 2012 the AAAS Board of Directors under Dr Fedoroff s chairmanship took the unusual step of taking a position on a contentious political issue just two weeks before voters in California went to the polls to decide on Proposition 37 a ballot initiative to label GMOs A review of the many political statements made by AAAS found no other examples of the organization attempting to influence voters ahead of a state election The AAAS and Dr Fedoroff did not respond to requests for comment Also disclosure the USRTK co directors worked on the pro labeling campaign The AAAS board s statement opposing GMO labeling was controversial It contained inaccuracies according to longtime AAAS members several of whom denounced the anti labeling statement as a paternalistic attack on consumer rights that misled the public by omitting important scientific and regulatory context An AAAS spokeswoman at the time Ginger Pinholster called the criticisms unfair and without merit She told a reporter she was in the room when the board passed the statement We are not an advocacy group We make our statements based on

communicating science appearing to be less than transparent is a really bad idea for the scientific community Dr Fedoroff was an early supporter of the industry backedNo on 37 campaign which listed her on its website in June 2012 as one of four scientists representing the scientific and academic community who opposed GMO labeling The campaign later asked Dr Fedoroff to help recruit more academics to their cause which she did according to an October 1 2012 email to Meghan Callahan of BCF Public Affairs I ve forwarded your request for academic supporters to an international group of

AAAS president Dr Fedoroff worked with agrichemical industry allies and an industry lobbyist to stop the U S Environmental Protection Agency from requiring companies to provide additional health and safety data for genetically engineered foods that are classified as pesticides according to emails described below The EPA proposal stemmed from a 2009 EPA Scientific Advisory Panel discussion about ways to improve the agency s ability to make regulatory decisions about plants that are genetically engineered to produce or contain pesticides which EPA refers to as plant incorporated protectants

nutrients and other hazardous proteins testing for synergistic effects on health and non target organisms when two or more GMO traits are combined stacked trait GMOs potential impacts on microbial

education activities For more details about the undisclosed funds Chassy received from Monsanto for years as he promoted biotechnology see reporting by Monica Engin WBEZ and emails posted by the New York Times On July 5 Dr Chassy emailed Eric Sachs of Monsanto to report thatDr Fedoroff had sent a letter to EPA over her signature co signed by 60 members of the National Academy of Sciences Nina

can mount a sustained opposition to their proposed rule making they believe that only a small handful are behind the petition and that most of the signatories are not committed to the issue The group

include a running list of news stories and commentary generated by our ongoing investigation U S Right to Know is conducting an investigation into the collusion between Big Food its front groups and

obtained via state Freedom of Information Act requests filed by U S Right to Know These emails reveal how Monsanto and its partners use so called independent third party scientists and professors to deliver their PR messaging Since the companies themselves are not credible messengers they use these scientists and professors as sock puppets to shape the media narrative on food issues particularly GMOs This is a key part of Big Food s PR strategy The agrichemical and food industries are spending vast sums of money to convince the public that their food crops GMOs additives and pesticides are safe desirable and healthy U S Right to Know has filed state Freedom of Information Acts requests to try to obtain the emails and documents of 43 public university faculty and staff to learn more about this public relations effort Thus far we have received documents in nine of these requests So most of the documents are likely still to come Some may arrive next week others may perhaps take a year or even more to arrive We have requested records from scientists economists law professors extension specialists and communicators All work in public institutions funded by the taxpayers We believe the public deserves to know more about the flow of money and level of coordination between public university scientists and other academics and the agrichemical and food companies whose interests they promote We have a right to know what s in our food and how companies attempt to influence our views about it Yet some find transparency so threatening that they equate consumer

food sovereignty from GM corn and glyphosate Dr María Elena Álvarez Buylla is an expert on the topic of genetic engineering who has co authored dozens of papers about molecular genetics ecology evolution and related topics She is a professor of molecular genetics epigenetics and development at Mexico s National Autonomous University Until the end of September Dr Álvarez Buylla was the head of Mexico s national science agency CONAHCYT the National Council of Humanities Science and Technology During the six year term of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador Álvarez Buylla s agency was charged with documenting the scientific evidence of the risks to human health and the environment of genetically modified GM corn and the herbicide glyphosate That research led to Mexico s precautionary policies to eliminate the use of GM corn in tortillas and to phase out the use of glyphosate When the U S government last year challenged those measures as unfair trade practices under the U S Mexico Canada Agreement USMCA her agency provided the scientific evidence underpinning the Mexican government s defense in the formal trade dispute a process that is now awaiting a ruling by the three member panel of arbitrators CONAHCYT recently published a comprehensive analysis and summary of that evidence asserting that both GM corn and glyphosate residues pose risks to human health and to the environment Dr Álvarez Buylla agreed to discuss her former agency s science based defense of what Mexico considers its sovereign right and obligation to protect public health and the environment from GM corn and glyphosate Timothy A Wise Since the Mexican government first announced its intentions to restrict GM corn cultivation and direct human consumption of GM corn and also to phase out the use of glyphosate the U S government has repeatedly stated that those policies have no scientific basis The national science agency you directed was charged with documenting the science Has Mexico answered the U S challenge María Elena Álvarez Buylla Yes I think there s ample documentation in Mexico s USMCA filings and in the dossier that we prepared and these show very clearly the risks of GM corn planting and consumption in tortillas and masa We have to remember that in Mexico we consume directly much more corn than anywhere in the world from half a kilo to a kilo a day Wise In light of the scientific evidence the Mexican government presented has the U S government responded by providing any of its own scientific proof that U S GM corn is safe for Mexicans to eat Álvarez

science agency CONAHCYT s comprehensive review of the science of risks from GM corn and glyphosate was recently published This dossier is 200 pages long with more than 1 200 references It presents the case that you re talking about which is why we had it translated into English Why did the science agency choose to publish the document now Álvarez Buylla This dossier was indeed the result of work done by many scientists in Mexico not only at CONAHCYT The new government which is also very interested in supporting decisions based on science asked to make the dossier public So it was released at the end of September just before my term ended at CONAHCYT and then published the next month Wise What are the main categories of risks to human health that your research identified from GM corn and glyphosate residues that justify the precautionary policies that Mexico has followed Álvarez Buylla Many animal studies have been done on Bt corn engineered to repel pests showing related gastrointestinal tract issues in mammals These have not been adequately studied in humans Then there are the glyphosate derived risks But there are many lawsuits in the United States over Non Hodgkin s lymphoma associated with the exposure to glyphosate and also other risks For example work has been done in the United States correlating the levels of glyphosate found in the samples of American people with the probability of being sick We still need many more long term studies in animals The President of Mexico at the time López Obrador actually proposed to the U S government that it collaborate with Mexico on such long term studies in animals but the U S government did not agree Wise Some of your own research was seminal in showing that the tortilla supply chain had been contaminated with both transgenes and glyphosate which establishes that GM corn is getting into your local corn supplies Álvarez Buylla Yes in fact that study was done in 2017 in my laboratory before I started my position as general director of CONAHCYT We found that 90 of tortilla samples from several cities not only Mexico City had some transgene fragment We also found glyphosate residues in one

fragment We also found glyphosate residues in one third of the samples that we studied Such studies have now been repeated and despite the fact that President López Obrador published a decree to avoid the use of transgenic maize in tortillas and in other human food we re still finding that some of these transgenic lines are being used for tortillas That is worrying because as I said before tortillas are consumed at very high levels in Mexico It is very important to keep tortillas and all the corn derived foods in Mexico free of GMOs and glyphosate The glyphosate residues that we found in tortillas were at levels that even in the U S are not allowed in food Wise I know that the dossier the scientific review also highlights the risks to the environment and to biological diversity What are the main areas of concern there Álvarez Buylla Many studies have found the impact of GMO cultures on diversity in general especially in lepidopterans for example in some types of butterflies and in the flora and fauna microflora and microfauna in the soil Glyphosate was supposed to decay very rapidly but that is not the case in watersheds rivers etc And then there is the risk of transgene flow into the native varieties In Mexico we have the obligation to keep this center of origin safe not only for Mexican food production but also for the world as it is a very valuable genetic reservoir There are many studies that have documented that it is not possible to segregate GM from non GM cultivars Wise I know that recently there were early indications from leaked sources that the trade tribunal on Mexico s GM corn restrictions may well rule in favor of the US President Sheinbaum has indicated that Mexico will seek other means to defend its GM corn restrictions Why is Mexico so committed to these policies Álvarez Buylla Mexico is committed to these policies because corn is our basic food The possible impact of any risk associated with GM corn would be very important for the Mexican people The nutritional quality of Mexican native corn varieties is also better The government is very interested in promoting their cultivation It is very important to promote their cultivation because the best way to preserve genetic diversity is in the hands of the peasant communities that are actively updating such diversity to adapt to local environments in Mexico Also in the

equipped to cope with increases in temperature and changes in global climate if we maintain this diversity Wise By all accounts the restrictions that President López Obrador put on GM corn and glyphosate are very popular with Mexicans and I ve read that they even have the commitment of the tortilla industries themselves to keep GM corn out of their products Do you think it s appropriate for the U S government to use a trade agreement to try to end such policies when the current restrictions are so popular and don t significantly affect U S exports Álvarez Buylla I don t think commercial trade agreements should interfere with the sovereignty of other countries and I think the trade agreements themselves have statements that ensure that countries can protect their sovereignty in terms of important issues Food sovereignty is one of the most important Keeping Mexican maize varieties as well as watersheds and foods in Mexico free of GMOs and glyphosate protects our food system and therefore our health Trade agreements should never be prioritized above the health and environment of the countries involved This pertains not only to Mexico but also to the U S because I m sure that the U S people are also concerned about the quality of their environment their food and their health Wise Mexico s Congress is now considering a constitutional amendment to ban the cultivation of GM corn and its use in foods such as tortillas produced for direct human consumption Why is that important Álvarez Buylla The decree by former President López Obrador is very important and it s a strong instrument But I think that a constitutional change that enforces the protection of Mexico s staple food will provide a long term assurance that we can take care of our food system our environment and our health That s why it s a priority for the Mexican government and the Mexican people That is the reason why both former President López Obrador and current President Dr Claudia Sheinbaum are putting forward these reforms Wise Thank you so much for speaking with us and congratulations on an amazing tenure at CONAHCYT and on the valuable resource you ve provided not just to Mexico but to all of us Álvarez Buylla Thank you Interview Transcript Timothy A Wise with María Elena Álvarez Buylla Nov 14 2024", "chunk_id":

Gary Ruskin 415 944 7350 U S Right to Know a new nonprofit organization released a new report today on Big Food s PR campaign to defend GMOs how it manipulated the media public opinion and politics with sleazy tactics bought science and PR spin Since 2012 the agrichemical and food industries have mounted a complex multifaceted public relations advertising lobbying and political campaign in the United States costing more than 100 million to defend genetically engineered food and crops and the pesticides that accompany them The purpose of this campaign is to deceive the public to deflect efforts to win the right to know what is in our food via labeling that is already required in 64 countries and ultimately to extend their profit stream for as long as possible This campaign has greatly influenced how U S media covers GMOs The industry s PR firm Ketchum even boasted that positive media coverage has doubled on GMOs The report outlines fifteen things that Big Food is hiding with its artful PR campaign on GMOs 1 The agrichemical companies have a history of concealing health risks from the public Time and again the companies that produce GMOs have hidden from consumers and workers the truth about the dangers of their products and operations So how can we trust them to tell us the truth about their GMOs 2 The FDA does not test whether GMOs are safe It merely reviews information submitted by the agrichemical companies 3 Our nation s lax policy on GMOs is the work of former Vice President Dan Quayle s anti regulatory crusade It was designed and delivered as a political favor to Monsanto 4 What the agrichemical and tobacco industries have in common PR firms operatives tactics The agrichemical industry s recent PR campaign is similar in some ways to the most infamous industry PR campaign ever the tobacco industry s effort to evade responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year 5 Russia s PR firm runs the agrichemical industry s big PR salvo on GMOs We don t trust the PR firm Ketchum when it spins for Russia and President Putin Why should we trust its spin on GMOs 6 The agrichemical industry s key front groups and shills aren t trustworthy Many of the industry s leading advocates have records of defending the indefensible or other scandals and conduct that inspires no confidence 7 The agrichemical companies have employed repugnant PR tactics These tactics include attacks on scientists and journalists and brainwashing children 8 The agrichemical companies have a potent political machine They have allies

grow their GMOs in their own home countries Because of the health and environmental risks of GMOs citizens of Germany and Switzerland won t allow farming of BASF Bayer and Syngenta s GMO seeds 10 Monsanto supported GMO labeling in the UK but opposes it in the USA Although Monsanto is based in St Louis Missouri Monsanto believes that British citizens deserve stronger consumer rights than Americans do 11 The pesticide treadmill breeds profits so it will likely intensify It is in the financial interest of the agrichemical companies to promote the evolution and spread of the most pestilential superweeds and superpests because these will spur the sale of the greatest quantities of the most expensive pesticides 12 GMO science is for sale Science can be swayed bought or biased by the agrichemical industry in many ways such as suppressing adverse findings harming the careers of scientists who produce such findings controlling the funding that shapes what research is conducted the lack of independent U S based testing of health and environmental risks of GMOs and tainting scientific reviews of GMOs by conflicts of interest 13 There are nearly no consumer benefits of GMOs The GMOs that Americans eat are not healthier safer or more nutritious than conventional foods They do not look better nor do they taste better By any measure that consumers actually care about they are not in any way an improvement Profits from GMOs accrue to the agrichemical companies while health risks are borne by consumers 14 The FDA and food companies have been wrong before they have assured us of the safety of products that were not safe Many drugs and food additives that the FDA allowed on the market have subsequently been banned because they were toxic or dangerous 15 A few other things the agrichemical industry doesn t want you to know about them crimes scandals and other wrongdoing The agrichemical industry s six major firms Monsanto Syngenta Dow DuPont Bayer and BASF

monthly food columns for the Washington Post since October 2013 Her columns frequently promote and defend pesticide industry products while she also receives payments to speak at industry aligned events and sometimes from industry groups This practice of journalists receiving payments from industry groups known as buckraking raises questions about objectivity A review of Haspel s Washington Post columns turns up further concerns In multiple instances Haspel failed to disclose or fully describe the industry connections of her sources relied on industry slanted studies cherry picked facts to back up industry positions or cited industry propaganda uncritically See our source review for documentation Haspel has not yet responded to inquiries for this article Agrichemical funding conflicts of interest I speak and moderate panels and debates often and it s work I m paid for Haspel wrote in a 2015 online chat hosted by theWashington Post in response to a question about whether she receives money from industry sources Haspel said she discloses her speaking engagements on her personal website but she does not disclose which companies or groups fund her or what amounts they give When asked how much money she has taken from the agrichemical industry and its front groups Haspel tweeted Since any group believing biotech has something to offer is a front group plenty According to the Washington Post Standards and Ethics reporters cannot accept gifts free trips preferential treatment or free admissions from news sources and should make every effort to remain in the audience to stay off the stage to report the news not to make the news These rules do not apply to freelancers however and the paper leaves it up to editors to decide Haspel s editor Joe Yonan has said he is comfortable with Haspel s approach to paid speaking engagements and finds it a reasonable balance For more information Pro GMO beat Haspel began writing about genetically engineered foods

Concerned Scientists was among them Haspel s next column GMO common ground Where supporters and opponents agree provided a broad range of perspectives from public interest as well as industry sources However in subsequent columns Haspel seldom quoted public interest groups and devoted far less space to public health sources than to industry connected sources She often quotes experts in risk perception who tend to downplay public health and safety concerns In several instances Haspel failed to disclose or fully describe industry ties to sources when reporting on GMOs pesticides or organic foods Industry sourced food movement column An example that illustrates problems of bias is Haspel s January 2016 column The surprising truth about the food movement She argues that people who care about genetic engineering or other aspects of food production the food movement are a marginal part of the population She included no interviews with consumer health environmental or justice groups that consider themselves part of the food movement Haspel sourced the column with two industry funded spin groups the International Food Information Council and Ketchum the public relations firm that runs the pesticide industry funded website GMO Answers While she described Ketchum as a PR firm that works extensively with the food industry Haspel did not disclose the background that Ketchum was hired by a trade association to change consumer views of GMO foods She also did she mention Ketchum s scandalous history of flacking for Russia and conducting espionage against environmental groups A

carcinogenicity of glyphosate Agrichemical industry spin events In June 2014 Haspel was a faculty member at a pesticide industry funded messaging training event called the Biotech Literacy Project Boot Camp The event was organized by the Genetic Literacy Project and Academics Review two industry front groups Monsanto also identified as industry partners in its 2015 PR plan Genetic Literacy Project is a former program of STATS and Academics Review was set up with the help of Monsanto to discredit industry critics while keeping corporate fingerprints hidden according to emails obtained through public records requests The boot camp Haspel attended was aimed at reframing the food safety and GMO debate according to the agenda Paul Thacker reported about the event in The Progressive Industry has also secretly funded a series of conferences to train scientists and journalists to frame the debate over GMOs and the toxicity of glyphosate In emails organizers referred to these conferences as biotech literacy bootcamps and journalists are described as partners Academics familiar with corporate spin tactics reviewed the boot camp documents at Thacker s request These are distressing materials said Naomi Oreskes professor of the history of science at Harvard University It is clearly intended to persuade people that GMO crops are beneficial needed and not sufficiently

of Florida The event was organized by Kevin Folta a professor tied in with agrichemical industry public relations and lobbying efforts Folta had even included Haspel in a proposal he sent to Monsanto seeking funding for events he described as a solution to the biotech communications problem The problem Folta said was due to activists control of public perception and their strong push for clunky

Haskel sic Amy Harmon and experts in public risk perception and psychology e g Dan Kahan Monsanto funded the proposal calling it a great 3rd party approach to developing the kind of advocacy we re looking to develop The money was later donated to a food pantry after the funding source became public In April 2015 Folta wrote to Haspel with details about the messaging training event We ll cover the costs and an honorarium whatever that takes The audience will be scientists physicians and other professionals that need to learn how to talk to the public Haspel responded I am definitely in and she relayed an anecdote from another recent science communication panel that had changed somebody s view about Monsanto It is possible to make headway but I m convinced it s by person to person

contained a glaring error that was later corrected even though her column linked to both the original and corrected study The study first equated pesticide exposures from food as equal to drinking one glass of wine every seven years The authors later corrected that to one glass of wine every three months That was only one of several errors in the paper according to a letter to the journal from scientists who described the study as overly simplistic and seriously misleading To dismiss concerns about the synergistic effects of exposure to multiple pesticides Haspel cited another study from the only non Bayer affiliated author of the flawed wine comparison study And she cited a 2008 report that made the same assessment Authors of that 2008 report included Alan Boobis and Angelo Moretto

2012 paper by the American Academy of Pediatrics out of context to reinforce her argument that eating organic might not offer health benefits and she did not inform readers of the full scope of the study or its conclusions The AAPpaper reported a wide range of scientific evidence suggesting harm to children from both acute and chronic exposures to various pesticides It concluded Children s exposures to pesticides should be limited as much as possible The report cited evidence of a drastic immediate decrease in urinary excretion of pesticide metabolites in children eating an organic diet AAP also issued policy recommendations to reduce children s exposure to pesticides Haspel left out all that context and reported only that the AAP report noted the correlation between organophosphate exposure and neurological issues that had been found in some studies but concluded that it was still unclear that reducing exposure by eating organic would be clinically relevant In her 2018 column about organic produce Haspel misleadingly reported that the pesticidechlorpyrifos has been the subject a battle between environmental groups which want it banned and the EPA which doesn t but she did not inform readers of a key point that the EPA had recommendedbanning chlorpyrifos due to mounting evidence that prenatal exposure could have lasting effects on children s brains The agency reversed course only after the Trump EPA interfered Haspel sourced hermisleading environmental groups vs EPA comparison with a link to a New York Times documents page that provided no context about the EPA decision rather than linking to the NYT story that reported on corporate influence behind the EPA decision to allow chlorpyrifos Relied on sources who agree with eachother In her 2018 column Haspel

from use in minimally processed corn products for health and environmental reasons In the ruling the USMCA panel found in favor of the U S on all seven claims and said Mexico s restrictions on GM corn in tortillas cannot stand because they are not based on adequate risk assessment scientific evidence and relevant international standards An effort to protect public health The USMCA panel said Mexico did not conduct an adequate risk assessment a process that identifies and evaluates hazards considers exposure levels and the effectiveness of existing controls and determines whether the associated risks are acceptable or require further mitigation Mexico argued that its policies to restrict GM corn are aligned with the principles of protection of public health and the rights of Indigenous peoples The government said it would abide by the ruling but did not say how it would do so Mexico now has 45 days to respond to the ruling In its ruling the panel ignored a large body of scientific evidence presented by Mexico including hundreds of peer reviewed studies that raise concerns about the health risks of GM corn and glyphosate These studies show very clearly the risks of GM corn planting and consumption in tortillas and masa Maria Elena Alvarez Bullya former director of CONAHCYT Mexico s national science agency told U S Right to Know last month We concluded that the evidence

countries such as Germany s Bayer and China s Syngenta Mexico s national campaign Sin Maíz No Hay País without corn there is no country said the ruling puts the interests of transnational corporations over the rights of Mexican people and their environment The controversy raises global concerns they said about the health risks of GM foods and illustrates the problem that food is considered as a commodity and not as a priority good for humanity Karen Hansen director of trade for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy said the panel ignored substantial scientific evidence on health and environmental risks sidestepped threats to Indigenous Rights and inappropriately anticipated economic harm to U S corn exporters when no harm has occurred The USMCA was hailed as a new kind of trade agreement taking some steps forward on issues like labor rights and investment This dispute shows how far we still need to go An analysis by researcher Timothy Wise notes that Mexico s corn ban would have had a small impact on trade affecting less than 1 of U S corn exports Why the U S brought the dispute to the USMCA anyway is a point of speculation In the view of Michael Antoniou a molecular geneticist who submitted scientific testimony to USMCA in defense of Mexico s position Mexico s policy to restrict GM corn imports for certain food products sets a major precedent for the world and

A new study of genetically modified crop technology by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine offers a mix of observations about the controversial crops and takes U S regulators to task for an ongoing lack of transparency that is fueling distrust by consumers and calls for mandatory labeling of GMO foods The lengthy report sponsored in part by the U S Department of Agriculture runs roughly 400 pages and seeks to address a range of environmental health social and regulatory issues surrounding genetically engineered GE crop technology It is the culmination of work by a committee that includes scientists specializing in ecology genetics and crop health from several state universities as well as experts from the International Food Policy Research Institute and other groups The release is timely coming as Congress is debating whether or not GMO foods should be labeled and as the Environmental Protection Agency assesses if glyphosate a widely used herbicide whose use has increased with the commercialization of glyphosate tolerant GMO crops should be restricted Both critics and fans can point to findings they deem favorable but the broad take away from the committee s work is that while GMOs on the market today appear not to pose a risk to human health there should be greater accountability to a wary public and more independent study of a range of potential risks The committee steered clear of taking a stand on the current hot button issue of GMO labeling declining to clearly endorse either the consumer groups who want mandatory labeling of GMO foods or the food and agribusiness players who want to block mandatory labeling like the law set to take effect in Vermont on July 1 But the committee did state that GMO labeling serves purposes that go beyond food safety There clearly are strong non safety arguments and considerable public support for mandatory labeling of products containing GE material The committee does not believe that mandatory labeling of foods with GE content is justified to protect public health however product labeling serves purposes that go beyond food safety U S policy makers and the private sector have the ability to address the broader social and economic issues and to balance the competing interests involved The committee further stressed a need for public accountability when it discussed regulatory reviews of these GMO crops Transparency and public participation have been shown by research to be critically important for appropriate sound and credible governance of all aspects of the development deployment and use of GE crops The committee said that much of the information submitted to regulatory agencies seeking approval of new GMO products is kept secret treated as confidential business information This lack of public access to health and safety data submitted by developers creates distrust the committee said", "chunk_id":

submitted by developers creates distrust the committee said Given a developer s self interest in getting a product approved and its control over the material considered by the agency the lack of access creates skepticism about the quality of the data The committee pointed out that in 2002 the U S General Accounting Office now Government Accountability Office recommended that the Food and Drug Administration randomly verify raw test data provided by a GMO developer but there is no evidence FDA has adopted that recommendation The committee said when it comes to environmental problems the committee did not find conclusive cause and effect evidence of environmental problems from the GE crops However evolved resistance to current GE characteristics in crops is a major agricultural problem The committee criticized USDA s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS for not requiring post market controls and monitoring of GMO crops which the committee said could have mitigated resistance problems before they spread When seeking to address a number of concerns about the health impacts of consumption of foods made with GMO crops the committee said that there was little evidence of specific links The committee concluded that no differences have been found that implicate a higher risk to human health safety from these GE foods than from their non GE counterparts The committee states this finding very carefully acknowledging that any new food GE or non GE may have some subtle favorable or adverse health effects that are not detected even with careful scrutiny and that health effects can develop over time Regarding specific concerns about GMOs and concerns about ties to allergies the committee said that testing for allergenicity before commercialization could miss allergens to which the population had not previously been exposed and post commercialization allergen testing would be useful in ensuring that consumers are not exposed to allergens though the committee said it realized such testing would be difficult to conduct NO GMO YIELD GAIN In another notable finding the committee s work countered the credibility of often repeated industry propaganda that genetically engineered crops are necessary to feed the world because they yield so much more than non GMO crops The report found little foundation for the claims of yield

Though agrichemical interests say the safety of the herbicide is firmly established and accepted by the world s scientific community the NAS committee said there is significant disagreement among expert committees on the potential harm that could be caused by the use of glyphosate on GE crops and in other applications The committee also addressed the dicey new debate over emerging genome editing technologies that are billed by developers as decreasing the risks of unintended changes in the plants The committee found that this decreased risk should simplify food safety testing However the committee also warned that major changes in metabolic pathways or insertion of multiple resistance genes will complicate the determination of food safety because changes in metabolic pathways are known to have unexpected effects on plant metabolites As part of the study the committee said it examined almost 900 research and other publications on the development use and effects of genetically engineered characteristics in corn soybean and cotton which account for almost all commercial GE crops to date As well the committee said it listened to 80 speakers at three public meetings and 15 public webinars and read more than 700 comments from members of the public The committee didn t provide all the answers and indeed in many ways raised new questions But the committee call for more

Know As the big food companies announce plans to label genetically engineered foods in the U S we take a closer look at pro and con arguments about the controversial food technology Two recent videos illuminate the divide over GMOs In January Bill Gates explained his support for genetic engineering in an interview with the Wall Street Journal s Rebecca Blumenstein What are called GMOs are done by changing the genes of the plant and it s done in a way where there s a very thorough safety procedure and it s pretty incredible because it reduces the amount of pesticide you need raises productivity and can help with malnutrition by getting vitamin fortification And so I think for Africa this is going to make a huge difference particularly as they face climate change The US China Brazil are using these things and if you want farmers in Africa to improve nutrition and be competitive on the world market you know as long as the right safety things are done that s really beneficial It s kind of a second round of the green revolution And so the Africans I think will choose to let their people have enough to eat If Gates is right that s great news That means the key to solving the hunger problem is lowering barriers for companies to get their climate resilient nutrition improved genetically engineered crops to market Is Gates right Another video released the same week as Gates WSJ interview provides a different perspective The short film by the Center for Food Safety describes how the state of Hawaii which hosts more open air fields of experimental genetically engineered crops than any other state has become contaminated with high volumes of toxic pesticides The film and report explain that five multinational agrichemical companies run 97 of GE field tests on Hawaii and the large majority of the crops are engineered to survive herbicides According to the video With so many GE field tests in such a small state many people in Hawaii live work and go to school near intensively sprayed test sites Pesticides often drift so it s no wonder that children and school and entire communities are getting sick To make matters even worse in most cases these companies are not even required to disclose what they re spraying If the Center for Food Safety is right that s a big problem Both these stories can t be right at the same time can they Facts on the ground Following the

enhanced crops Instead the large majority of GMO crops being grown on Hawaii and in the US are herbicide tolerant crops that are driving up the use of glyphosate the main ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup and a chemical the World Health Organization s cancer experts classify as probably carcinogenic to humans In the 20 years since Monsanto introduced Roundup Ready GMO corn and soy glyphosate use has increased 15 fold and it is now the most heavily used agricultural chemical in the history of the world reported Douglas Main in Newsweek The heavy herbicide use has accelerated weed resistance on millions of acres of farmland To deal with this problem Monsanto is rolling out new genetically engineered soybeans designed to survive a combination of weed killing chemicals glyphosate and dicamba EPA has yet to approve the new herbicide mix But Dow Chemical just got the green light from a federal judge for its new weed killer combo of 2 4D and glyphosate called Enlist Duo designed for Dow s Enlist GMO seeds EPA tossed aside its own safety data to approve Enlist Duo reported Patricia Callahan in Chicago Tribune The agency then reversed course and asked the court to vacate its own approval a request the judge denied without giving reason All of this raises questions about the claims Bill Gates made in his Wall Street Journal interview about thorough safety procedures and reduced use of pesticides Concerns grow in Hawaii Argentina Iowa Instead of bustling with promising new types of resilient adaptive GMO crops Hawaii is bustling with grassroots efforts to protect

communities and they re calling for broader longer term studies to rule out agrochemical exposure as a cause of these and other illnesses Monsanto spokesman Thomas Helscher responded the absence of reliable data makes it very difficult to establish trends in disease incidence and even more difficult to establish causal relationships To our knowledge there are no established causal relationships The absence of reliable data is compounded by the fact that most chemicals are assessed for safety on an individual basis yet exposures typically involve chemical combinations We are breathing eating

caused by industrial agriculture certainly the nitrate pollution of drinking water would begin to evaporate These experiences in three areas leading the world in GMO crop production are obviously relevant to the question of whether Africa should embrace GMOs as the best solution for future food security So why isn t Bill Gates discussing these issues Propaganda watch GMO proponents like to focus on possible future uses of genetic engineering technology while downplaying ignoring or denying the risks They often try to marginalize critics who raise concerns as uninformed or anti science or as Gates did they suggest a false choice that countries must accept GMOs if they want to let their people have enough to eat This logic leaps over the fact that after decades of development most GMO crops are still engineered to withstand herbicides or produce insecticides or both while more complicated and much hyped traits such as vitamin enhancement have failed to get off the ground Like the hover boards of the Back to the Future franchise golden rice is an old idea that looms just beyond the grasp of reality reported Tom Philpott in Mother Jones Meanwhile the multinational agrichemical companies that also own a large portion of the seed business are profiting from both the herbicide resistant seeds and the herbicides they are designed to resist and many new GMO applications in the pipeline follow this same vein These corporations have also spent hundreds of million dollars on public relations efforts to promote industrial scale chemical intensive GMO agriculture as the answer to world hunger using similar talking points that Gates put forth in his Wall Street Journal interview and that Gates funded groups also echo For a recent article in The

group provides little information about possible risks or downsides of GMOs and instead amplifies the agrichemical industry s PR mantra that the science is settled on the safety and necessity of GMOs

glyphosate based herbicides that go with GMOs are also obviously relevant to the safety discussion Yet rather than raising these issues as part of a robust science discussion the Cornell Alliance for Science deploys fellows and associates to downplay concerns about pesticides in Hawaii and attack journalists who report on these concerns It s difficult to understand how these sorts of shenanigans

extraordinary influence across governments academics and the media there is an absence of critical voices the group said But corporate voices are close at hand The head of the Gates Foundation agricultural research and development team is Rob Horsch who spent decades of his career at Monsanto The case for an honest conversation Rather than making the propaganda case for GMOs Bill Gates and Gates funded groups could play an important role in elevating the scientific integrity of the GMO debate and ensuring that new food technologies truly benefit communities Technology isn t inherently good or bad it all depends on the context As Gates put it as long as the right safety things are done But those safety things aren t being done Protecting children from toxic pesticide exposures in Hawaii and Argentina and cleaning up water supplies in Iowa doesn t have to prevent genetic engineering from moving forward But those issues certainly highlight the need to take a precautionary approach with GMOs and pesticides That would require robust and independent assessments of health and environmental impacts and protections for farmworkers and communities That would require transparency including labeling GMO foods as well as open access to scientific data public notification of pesticide spraying and full disclosure of industry influence over academic and science organizations It would require having a more honest conversation about GMOs and pesticides so that all nations can use the full breadth of scientific knowledge as they consider whether or not to adopt

fellowship s with cash awards for select journalists to promote in depth contextualized reporting about issues related to food security crop production biotechnology and sustainable agricultural Are these journalists also GMO advocates How ethical is it for journalists to represent the policy positions of a pro agrichemical industry group Messaging for corporate interests One thing is clear from the publicly available CAS messaging the context they offer on the topic of genetically engineered foods is not in depth and comprehensive but rather highly selective and geared toward advancing the interests of the agrichemical industry For example the video Brimming with hope about the possibilities of GMOs to solve world hunger in the future it ignores a large body of scientific research that has documented problems connected with GMOs that herbicide tolerant GMO crops have driven up the use of glyphosate an herbicide linked to cancer by the world s leading cancer experts and accelerated weed resistance on millions of acres of U S farmland which makes crop production harder for farmers not easier There is no mention of the failure of GMO crops designed to ward off harmful insects or the rising concerns of medical doctors about patterns of illness in places like Hawaii and Argentina where exposures are heaviest to the chemicals associated with GMOs There is no recognition that many scientists and food leaders have said GMOs are not a priority for feeding the world a debate that is a key reason GMO crops have not been widely embraced outside of the United States and Latin America All these factors are relevant to the discussion about whether or not developing countries should embrace genetically engineered crops and foods But CAS leaves aside these details and amplifies the false idea that the science is settled on the safety and necessity of GMOs Disseminating selective information of a biased or misleading nature to promote a particular agenda is known as the practice of propaganda Working from industry s PR playbook The Cornell Alliance for Science was supposed to present a new vision for biotechnology communications yet the group relies on an established set of messages and communication tactics that are familiar to anyone who follows the PR campaigns of the agribusiness industry The report Spinning Food which I co authored with Kari Hamerschlag and Anna Lappé documents how agribusiness and food industry funded groups are spending tens of millions of dollars a year to promote misleading messages about the safety and necessity of industrial scale chemical intensive genetically engineered agriculture The companies that profit most from this system Monsanto Dow DuPont and other agrichemical giants have repeatedly violated trust

front groups and third party allies such as scientists and professors to spread their messaging for them A core industry narrative is that the science on GMO safety is settled Pro industry messengers focus on possible future uses of the technology while downplaying ignoring or denying the risks make inaccurate claims about the level of scientific agreement on GMOs and attack critics who raise concerns as anti science As one example Mark Lynas political director of CAS wrote a New York Times op ed accusing 17 European Union countries that banned GMO crop cultivation of turning against science He dubbed them the coalition of the ignorant The article is heavy on attack and light on science brushing over the topic with an inaccurate claim about a safety consensus that many scientists have disputed As molecular geneticist Belinda Martineau PhD wrote in response to Lynas Making general claims about the safety of genetic engineering is unscientific illogical and absurd The World Health Organization states it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods Yet while claiming to stand up for science CAS routinely makes general even outlandish claims about GMO safety From the group s FAQ You are more likely to be hit by an asteroid than be hurt by GE food and that s not an exaggeration GE crops currently available to the public pose no greater health risks or environmental concerns than their non engineered counterparts This is not opinion In fact it is propaganda Battling transparency in science In the spring of 2014 CAS launched a

Africa Monsanto not only suggested the topic to professor Calestous Juma It went so far as to provide a summary of what the paper could say and a suggested headline The company then connected the professor with a marketing company to pump it out over the Internet as part of Monsanto s strategy to win over the public and lawmakers Krantz wrote Juma said he took no money from Monsanto but noted he has received funding from the Gates Foundation which has been partnering with Monsanto for years on pro GMO projects after Rob Horsch Monsanto s veteran top executive for international development joined the Foundation in 2006 Horsch now leads Gates agricultural research and development team A 2014 analysis by the research group Grain found that about 90 of 3 billion the Gates Foundation has spent to feed the poor in Africa has gone to wealthy nations primarily universities and research centers The public has a right to know if academics posing as independent sources are working behind the scenes with corporations and their PR firms on coordinated messaging campaigns to push a corporate agenda CAS takes the position in its petition that the public doesn t have a right to know about the ties between industry PR operatives and 14 public scientists who have contributed to the scientific consensus about the safety of GMOs The Cornell petition is accompanied by a photo montage featuring Carl Sagan Madame Curie Albert Einstein and other deceased scientists who have not signed the petition stamped with the slogan I stand with the Science14 a bit of PR flair that mirrors the

Update June 27 A new compromise bill announced by Senator Stabenow is completely unacceptable and worse than the original bill say consumer advocates Read the latest news here By Stacy Malkan Nearly 90 of Americans say genetically engineered food should be labeled with high support across all ages races and political affiliations according to a December 2015 Mellman Group poll It s hard to think of a political issue that shares such broad appeal Belief in our right to know what s in our food is as American as apple pie Now after a hard fought battle led by millions of consumers and the nation s largest environmental health and consumer groups we are winning that right Large food companies from General Mills to Kellogg to Campbell s have said they are putting labels on food products to indicate if they are produced with genetic engineering Is it possible to undo this progress Could the new food labels actually roll back to the factories to be replaced by incomprehensible black blobs called QR codes Are Senate Democrats led by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow about to make a deal that will stop GMO labeling in its tracks The agrichemical industry is swarming the U S Senate right now with a last ditch lobbying effort to pass the DARK Deny Americans the Right to Know Act and thereby nullify state labeling efforts They have just a few weeks left to get this done before Vermont implements the nation s first mandatory GMO labeling law July 1 The House of Representatives passed the DARK Act last year Rep John Conyers D MI said at the time in a CNN op ed The fact that Congress is even considering a proposal to deny Americans basic information about their food speaks to overwhelming power of these corporate lobbyists over the public interest All eyes are now on Sen Stabenow who according to the Hagstrom Report just proposed new language for a compromise This may or may not include QR codes an 800 number or some other way of claiming mandatory labeling while allowing food companies to remove the words genetic engineering from the new labels that are already on their way to a store near you Details on the compromise are murky But one thing is clear as the ranking

hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know Of the approximately 30 traits that are genetically engineered into crops for commercial use they fall into two distinct classes Many are either pesticide or herbicide resistant or both to withstand dousings of potent chemicals such as glyphosate Some have a pesticide called Bt toxin incorporated into them to withstand pest infestations Some have both 1 To be generous to the agrichemical industry of all these genetically engineered crops that have been brought to market only three may have actually provided any benefits to consumers These are the Flavr Savr tomato the Rainbow papaya and the Innate potato 2 In 1994 the company Calgene marketed the first genetically engineered product a tomato called the Flavr Savr that was intended to have a longer shelf life 3 It was withdrawn from the market in 1997 after the company was purchased by Monsanto which stopped selling the seeds 4 Then there is the Rainbow papaya which was genetically engineered to withstand the ringspot virus It is now the most prevalent papaya grown in Hawaii Finally there is a new genetically engineered Innate potato that may produce less of the toxic chemical acrylamide when fried 5 That s it One hasn t been cultivated in the 21 st century another preserved the cultivation of papayas in Hawaii and another is entirely new Now let s examine the rest of the genetically engineered foods and products that most Americans eat in large amounts These are corn soybeans sugar beets canola and cotton think cottonseed oil The genetically engineered foods that Americans eat are not healthier safer or more nutritious than conventional foods They do not look better nor do they taste better They do not have a longer shelf life Using any measure that consumers actually care about they are not in any way an improvement over conventional products They do however confer risks to consumers There are studies that link genetically engineered foods to allergies liver and kidney disease and other illnesses 6 Well then who benefits from genetically engineered food and crops The agrichemical companies do they sell the seeds and the pesticides that often go with them Perhaps some farmers do as well Consumers do not benefit In other words the agrichemical industry is selling consumers a basket of products in which there appears to be risk but no benefits That raises an important question If there are no benefits to consumers why should we bear any health risks of

Association IDFA represents dairy manufacturers processors and marketers Petitioned to add artificial sweeteners to milk without special notation on package Consumers Union sharply critical of petition to add sweeteners to milk without labeling Close ally of the sweetener and candy manufacturers Calls ice cream a nutritious snack for kids but opposed more fruits vegetables in Women Infant Children nutrition program Opposed FDA changes to recommended daily nutrients since dairy could seem less healthy Spent more than 1 5 million annually in lobbying from 2011 2013 Spent over 60 000 to send members of Congress and staff to tropical destinations IDFA Petitioned to Put Artificial Sweeteners in Milk without Additional Labeling In 2013 the IDFA petitioned the Food Drug Administration FDA to allow the use of artificial sweeteners in milk without additional labeling requirements According to the FDA the petition calls for FDA to change the standard of identity for milk A standard of identity is the federal requirement that determines what ingredients some food products must or may contain to be marketed under certain names The petition asks the FDA to amend the standard of identity for flavored milk and 17 other dairy products including nonfat dry milk heavy cream eggnog half and half and sour cream so that non nutritive sweeteners are among the standard ingredients The products would then not require any additional description on the label If we granted the petition a carton of chocolate milk made with non nutritive sweeteners would simply say chocolate milk the same as a carton made with nutritive sweeteners such as sugar said Felicia Billingslea director of FDA s Food Labeling and Standards staff You would need to read the ingredient list which is typically on the back or the side of the product in order to tell the difference between the two Food Drug Administration Consumers Union IDFA Proposal Would Decrease Not Increase Fair Dealing In The Interest of Consumers The Consumers Union opposes IDFA s petition and issued comments critical of the plan We urge the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to reject the IDFA NMPF petition because we believe

IDFA Proposal Distorts Reality A 2013 editorial in the Green Bay Gazette criticized the IDFA plan to use artificial sweeteners in milk without additional labeling The proposal would make it less apparent whether artificial ingredients have been added to your regular or flavored milk the Gazette wrote In other words nowhere on the label of the milk carton will it say reduced calorie or reduced sugar or words that would let you know they ve been artificially sweetened So you might grab a jug of regular milk only later to realize it tastes sweet or your chocolate milk tastes differently Then

Tipton vowed that his organization would oppose adding more fruits and vegetables to the Women and Infant Children WIC program if that meant fewer dairy products in the program In July for instance the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee that Sen Herb Kohl chairs demanded the USDA immediately publish revised food specifications consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and USDA s Food Guide Pyramid But that was before the dairy industry a powerful constituency in Kohl s home state started to worry that a government effort to combat obesity in Americans might lead the Agriculture Department and Congress to replace some dairy products with fruits and vegetables in federal nutrition programs Simply adding fruits and vegetables to the WIC program probably would not have touched off the current lobbying battle But Congress is unlikely to increase funds for the program so adding new foods would mean cutting money for dairy E Linwood Tipton president and CEO of the

science lead championed ACSH to his colleagues I can assure you I am not all starry eyed about ASCH they have PLENTY of warts but You WILL NOT GET A BETTER VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR than ACSH emphasis in original Goldstein also sent his colleagues links to 53 ACSH posts a pesticide review two books and a pamphlet promoting Monsanto products that he described as EXTREMELY USEFUL Key player in Monsanto s propaganda network ACSH is one of the well known propaganda websites that played a key role in attacking the scientists who raised cancer concerns according to an award winning investigation by Le Monde In May 2017 plaintiffs attorneys suing Monsanto over Roundup links to cancer stated in a brief Monsanto quietly funnels money to think tanks such as the Genetic Literacy Project and the American Council on Science and Health organizations intended to shame scientists and highlight information helpful to Monsanto and other chemical producers Emails obtained by U S Right to Know highlight another example of how ACSH plays a product defense role for companies The emails reveal that Monsanto initially chose ACSH to publish a series of papers to promote GMOs that were assigned to professors by Monsanto then merchandized by a PR firm engaged to promote them Monsanto s Eric Sachs wrote to the professors To ensure that the papers have the greatest impact the American Council for Science and Health is partnering with CMA Consulting to drive the project The completed policy briefs will be offered on the ACSH website CMA and ACSH also will merchandize the policy briefs including the development of media specific materials such as op eds blog postings speaking engagements events webinars etc The papers were published by the Genetic Literacy Project with no disclosure of Monsanto s role Leaked ACSH financial documents A 2012 financial summary for ACSH leaked by an employee and reported by Mother Jones revealed that ACSH received funding from a large number of

pollution during pregnancy and early childhood can lead to lasting changes in the brain s white matter which plays an essential role in the nervous system according to a first of its kind study published in the latest issue of Environmental Research The study led by the nonprofit research center Barcelona Institute for Global Health ISGlobal builds on evidence that suggests air pollution affects brain development and causes serious health problems in the heart and lungs Its results released Wednesday highlight the importance of addressing air pollution as a public health issue particularly for pregnant women and children Since these findings were present in children exposed to particulate matter concentrations above the currently recommended maximum values by the World Health Organization WHO but below those recommended by the European Union EU our study provides support for more stringent European guidelines on acceptable levels of air pollution the study s authors conclude EU air quality standards are less strict for all pollutants than WHO air quality guideline levels and air pollution remains a major health concern for Europeans according to the European Environment Agency The U S also falls short The Environmental Protection Agency EPA earlier this year revised its National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS for particulates to 9 0 micrograms per cubic meter which is still nearly double WHO guidelines White matter consists of nerve fibers like communication cables connecting regions and transmitting signals within the brain and between the brain and spinal cord These new findings suggest that air pollutants detrimental effect on white matter microstructure occurs and can sometimes persist as children age Even if the size of the effects were small this can have a meaningful impact on a population scale says Mònica Guxens an ISGlobal researcher and co author of the report According to ISGlobal this also marks the first time researchers have studied a large cohort through childhood to investigate the association between air pollution and white matter microstructure The team followed more than 4 000 participants of the

molecules spread within the brain i e the less mature the brain the more water flows in all directions and the lower the fractional anisotropy level Every increase in air pollution exposure level corresponded to a 5 month delay in the development of FA Certain pollutants also caused changes in mean diffusivity a measure of the integrity of the brain s white matter which declines with age Some changes diminished as the children got older while others persisted More research is needed to determine precisely how changes occur Lower fractional anisotropy is likely the result of changes in myelin the protective sheath that forms around the nerves rather than in the structure or packaging of the nerve fibers says Michelle Kusters ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study It s not known precisely how air pollution affects myelin Researchers believe it could be due to small particles entering the brain or inflammation due to particles in the lungs Damage to myelin can affect

brain scans taken multiple times in a large population based group of children from birth says lead author Michelle Kusters Published recently February 2025 in Environment International the

matures In newborns and young children basic brain networks develop quickly in the first few years The amygdala for example grows by 105 in the first year and 15 in the second which may make it particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution Other networks involved in higher level thinking usually develop later in childhood Pollutants also shown to affect brain volume For this study the researchers studied data from 3 626 children in Rotterdam Netherlands The children were scanned twice once around age 10 and again at age 14 while they were resting not doing any tasks The researchers looked at pollution exposure during two periods from birth to age three and in the year before the brain scans and used statistical models to estimate pollution exposure combining actual measurements with local environmental information They noted several limitations of the study including that it did not include air pollution data for schools or repeated measurements for all children in the study Another related study from the same research team examined how air pollution during pregnancy and childhood affects brain volume the amount of space the brain occupies through adolescence Based on data from 4 243 children from a large Dutch population based birth cohort the study found that exposure to PM 2 5 and copper from vehicle brake and tire wear during pregnancy was linked at age 8 to smaller hippocampal volume However the hippocampus appeared to show catch up growth over time between 8 and 17 years suggesting plasticity in this area of the brain might mitigate the adverse effects of early life air pollution While some brain regions may adapt the researchers say ongoing disruptions in functional brain networks could have long term effects More research is needed along with better protection for children they say Given the widespread exposure to air pollution these results reinforce the importance of policies aimed at reducing pollution levels particularly in urban

consumption trackers However researchers in the latest study show alcohol industry backed apps provide significantly less accurate feedback and omit much more information on associated health risks including cancer and cardiovascular disease than apps that do not receive industry funding Apps to avoid The industry backed tools use dark patterns which researchers say are strategies for influencing people to act against their best interests This includes providing users with limited drink options in small serving sizes which makes it impossible to check consumption against recommended guidelines It also may lead users to believe they drink at lower risk levels than they actually are at a time when more than 170 000 people die from excessive alcohol use each year in the

trivia Consider this example Serbia toasts with the word Živeli which means Let s live long appears above Alcohol is a depressant and stops you doing things properly like driving Less info on serious health harms Among other findings researchers also reported alcohol industry funded tools Offer less information on other serious harms such as liver damage reduced fertility and addiction Less likely to inform users about national low risk drinking guidelines including daily and weekly limits one AIF tool erroneously provided binge limits as daily consumption advice More likely to include features such as time to drive blood alcohol calculations while independent sources focused more on reducing consumption and understanding risks Two thirds less likely than independent alcohol reduction tools to provide users with links to services such as mental health alcohol or financial support Further research is needed along with more regulation and oversight by public health departments and governments researchers say But enough evidence exists they maintain to raise serious concerns about alcohol industry funded tools and organizations We need to remember that these organizations are not health organizations says Prof Mark Petticrew who co authored the study and the book The Commercial Determinants of Health Their covert and sometimes overt purpose is the marketing promotion and

63 of Americans including pregnant women and children regularly consume products containing aspartame which is approved in more than 90 countries Photo credit Dreamer Co Aspartame the artificial sweetener found in everything from Diet Coke and sugar free chewing gum to children s medications may raise the risk of the most common type of stroke by causing inflammation and disrupting blood vessel health and blood flow according to new research Published last month July 2025 in Scientific Reports the study is the first to combine advanced computer modelling techniques to examine how aspartame interacts with processes in the body that can lead to a stroke or affect its severity its authors said The findings add to longstanding concerns about the sugar substitute s impacts on the brain and heart Given that aspartame is one of the most pervasive artificial sweeteners used in the global food industry its cumulative effects from long term low dose exposure may indirectly affect cerebrovascular brain blood vessel health through metabolic interference the researchers said Ischemic stroke which accounts for about 87 of all strokes in the US and is a leading cause of death globally occurs when a blood clot blocks a brain blood vessel cutting off oxygen and causing brain cells to die Common risk factors include high blood pressure smoking and type 2 diabetes Aspartame also marketed as NutraSweet Equal Sugar Twin and AminoSweet is up to 200 times sweeter than sugar and promoted as a way to cut calories and sugar intake especially for people with diabetes Its safety has been debated for decades with studies linking aspartame consumption to chronic diseases weight gain and even aggressive brain cancer This study provides preliminary systematic insights into the potential neurotoxicity mechanisms of aspartame its authors said They found that aspartame strongly binds to and influences five key genes that code for proteins linked to ischemic stroke These proteins help regulate inflammation the body s response to injury or infection blood pressure and the strength and function of blood vessels Disruptions may Raise blood pressure Trigger inflammation in the brain and blood vessels Weaken blood vessel walls and the brain s protective barrier blood brain barrier allowing harmful substances to enter the brain and worsen a stroke Our integrated analysis suggests that aspartame may contribute to ischemic brain injury through multi target interactions potentially disrupting inflammatory responses and vascular homeostasis the researchers said

maintains that aspartame is safe when consumed within the recommended daily limit of 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight However in 2023 the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC

obesity type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease Most research into artificial sweeteners AS and cerebrovascular accidents CVAs links artificial sweetener use and strokes especially ischemic strokes with higher risks for female and Black populations according to a study published last year June 2024 Aspartame has also been associated with weight gain and serious health problems such as Alzheimer s disease In the largest study of its kind tracking over 100 000 people for eight years high consumption was associated with a 15 higher cancer risk Another study suggested the artificial sweetener may alter gut bacteria in ways that promote glioblastoma an aggressive form of brain cancer More information is needed to confirm the effects of aspartame on stroke risk the researchers said They recommended animal studies to better understand the impact of its breakdown products and long term exposure as well as large scale human studies to clarify the relationship between intake levels and stroke risk If you are concerned about stroke risk consider limiting your intake of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners Choose whole unprocessed foods and be mindful of ingredient labels since

Photo credit iStock by Getty Images Exposure to a widely used herbicide called atrazine AT can make nerve cells age faster and harm the hypothalamus an essential part of the brain increasing the risk of neurodegenerative disease according to a recently released study in mice A complete nerve cell neuron structure and sufficient mature nerve cells are critical for the central nervous system to work properly The study published this month Dec 13 2024 in Research shows the number of nerve cells and mature nerve cells in the mouse brain significantly decreased after exposure to atrazine These results directly proved the neurotoxicity of AT the researchers say Atrazine is a common surface water drinking water pollutant and endocrine disruptor that poses environmental and health risks It has been linked to reproductive complications including fetal development problems and birth defects and certain cancers in humans Atrazine has also been associated with liver kidney and heart damage in animals according to the CDC The new study shows that atrazine exposure ages certain brain cells in mice causing them to stop dividing and growing It also highlights for the first time the role of a specific stress response pathway in disrupting the processes healthy cells use to detect repair or remove damaged parts In addition the study reveals how atrazine exposure can seriously damage the hypothalamus which is important for controlling hormones and helps regulate the body s stress response growth metabolism and reproduction Most research on the hypothalamus has focused on how atrazine affects hormones and not how it damages the structure and shape of the hypothalamus the researchers say The research comes as the EPA considers a proposal to raise the acceptable level of atrazine in watersheds from an average of 3 4 micrograms per liter to nearly three times as much The study s findings show that atrazine in mice Damages nerve cells neurons and activates microglia immune cells in the brain that act as its first responders to injury infection or disease Sends certain brain stem cells Hypothalamic Neural Stem Cells or HtNSCs to the areas of injury in the hypothalamus Overly activates the body s stress response system Integrated Stress Response pathway or ISR which makes these HtNSCs age prematurely stop dividing and growing and impairs their ability to maintain and

globally after glyphosate with an annual usage of 180 million pounds 90 000 tons In the U S more than 70 million pounds 35 000 tons of atrazine are applied by certified workers most often on farms and along highways and railroads The European Union banned atrazine in 2004 after it was found to regularly exceed the maximum limits in groundwater In 2020 the EPA banned atrazine use in Hawaii and some U S territories including Puerto Rico and Guam A previous study by these same researchers showed that mice exhibited spatial learning and memory impairments after atrazine exposure In this study they gave mice different doses of atrazine and studied its effects on HtNSCs and brain damage They also looked into how atrazine causes HtNSC aging by analyzing gene activity and tested the findings in lab grown brain cells The researchers say atrazine induced damage to the hypothalamus includes the breakdown of cell nuclei which contain DNA and the protective covering of nerve cells myelin sheath Atrazine also degrades important cell structures like mitochondria which produce most of a cell s energy and can trigger cell death apoptosis when a cell is damaged beyond repair The research team also found in nerve cells more lipofuscin a pigmented substance that is a sign of cell aging and can interfere with the cell s ability to work as well as it should Additional experiments with another neural stem cell line confirmed the findings the study shows Those cells also showed signs of aging DNA damage and losing their ability to grow and form new neurons when exposed to atrazine The team

most harmful To estimate nitrate exposure Semprini matched drinking water data to birth records within 30 days of conception when a fetus is especially vulnerable He also tested for exposure more than 90 days before conception and found no link to poor outcomes suggesting that early pregnancy exposure is what matters most The study found nitrate levels in the state s public drinking water rose by 8 each year during the study period averaging 4 2 mg L across all births More than 80 of the babies studied were exposed to some level of nitrate and 1 in 10 were exposed to levels above the federal limit Overall 5 were born underweight and 7 5 were born preterm Key findings include Exposure to more than 0 1 mg L of nitrate was linked to a 0 66 percentage point increase in preterm birth risk a 9 rise compared to the average Exposure to more than 5 mg L was associated with a 0 33 percentage point increase in the risk of low birth weight under 5 8 pounds or 2 500 grams Pregnancies exposed to low nitrate levels were also slightly shorter by about 0 25 to 0 5 days on average Higher exposures above the EPA limit did not show stronger effects suggesting the current threshold may not be

medical decision making in ways that benefit drug and device companies They have been shown to increase healthcare costs for consumers and lead to implicit bias unconsciously influencing physicians behavior in favor of certain industry products and services that may not necessarily be good for patients health They can alter prescribing habits for instance and also factor into decisions about which medical devices to use Drug and medical device manufacturers are required under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to report payments items of value and investment interests worth 10 or more to healthcare providers Some states hospitals and academic institutions have their own rules limiting certain industry gifts and payments but there are no federal laws limiting what an individual provider may accept From 2020 to 2023 alone the total value of pharmaceutical and medical device industry general non research payments to physicians exceeded 8 billion in value according to the Open Payments Database records categorized by stakeholder The number of physicians receiving these payments also increased by 28 in that period We have a systemic problem As these payments persist experts continue to sound warning bells The money is so tempting that in some ways I m not surprised and there s no watchdog says Dr Lisa Cosgrove of the University of Massachusetts Boston whose research

journal Heart shows doctors who received industry sponsored meals with a median value per meal of 17 were more than twice as likely to prescribe a new heart failure drug to Medicare recipients An increase in the number of free meals for doctors was also linked to more Medicare bills for this drug and higher costs the study shows Industry ties undermine patient care and public trust says Dr Adriane Fugh Berman a Georgetown University professor and director of PharmedOut The organization a project of the Georgetown University Medical Center educates healthcare professionals and students about pharmaceutical and medical device marketing practices It s a very bad system Commercially supplied information is always designed to advance commercial goals she says It s not objective and the best chance that physicians have of avoiding biased commercial information is avoiding contact with industry and industry provided information They shouldn t take gifts of any kind whether they are meals or money from these companies Fugh Berman s research has shown that industry gifts of any size are associated with more expensive prescriptions and more branded prescriptions as well as a greater number of drugs prescribed to a patient increasing the risk of adverse effects Consider Neurology Nearly 8 000 neurosurgeons in the U S received roughly 479 million in general payments from

published Nov 26 2024 in BMC Medicine builds on growing evidence that carrageenan a common additive in ultra processed foods may damage the lining of the small intestine and the body s ability to process blood sugar insulin resistance These harms can potentially lead to serious chronic conditions such as Crohn s disease and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease especially in people with higher body weight BMI the researchers say Our study performed in healthy young men is unique as it indicates that already a short term and moderately increased intake of carrageenan may have pro inflammatory effects in the gut in humans which can particularly lead to metabolic problems in those being overweight says lead author Dr Robert Wagner of the German Diabetes Center DDZ The study adds The results warrant caution with carrageenan containing foods especially in individuals who are prone to develop type 2 diabetes Previous studies have shown that carrageenan has similar effects in animals Studies have also suggested direct associations in humans between type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer and exposure to various food additives widely used in ultra processed foods Research has also shown that removing carrageenan may improve insulin signaling and glucose tolerance In this study researchers found in lab tests with 20 men that moderate intake of carrageenan in those with higher BMI can weaken the lining of the small intestine most likely due to pro inflammatory mechanisms in the gut It may also contribute to insulin resistance Increased risk of intestinal and metabolic disease A weakened intestinal lining is significant because it reduces the protective mucus layer and allows toxins into the bloodstream intestinal permeability or leaky gut Intestinal permeability is associated with chronic diseases of the intestine such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD including Crohn s disease CD and ulcerative colitis UC Our investigation suggests that the consumption of carrageenan similar to what has been observed in animal studies can impair the barrier function of the intestine says Wagner This could have long term health consequences and increase the risk of inflammatory diseases Researchers found participants with higher BMI showed a reduction in the effectiveness of the hormone insulin which lowers blood sugar glucose That can lead to problems with how the body processes energy to function metabolism says Wagner Those with higher BMI who had higher carrageenan intake also showed markers of increased

its impact on human health the researchers ran a series of tests to measure different aspects of metabolism insulin sensitivity and gut health They specifically looked at its effects on liver fat body fat distribution blood sugar levels gut bacteria and inflammation markers Study participants included only men who did not have higher weight obesity or chronic disease They were given either a placebo or carrageenan in addition to their normal diet in an amount roughly equivalent to two to three times the daily dose consumed in the U S Both groups were observed over two weeks between October 2015 and December 2016 Because gut barrier problems are more common in people with a high fat diet high blood sugar or obesity the effects of carrageenan on glucose metabolism and inflammation may have been harder to detect among study participants the researchers say In addition only young healthy men participated so results may not apply to older or less healthy groups the researchers

Widely applied in the U S on potatoes and other crops diquat is banned in the EU Switzerland and the U K due to its environmental and health risks Photo credit JESHOOTS com on Unsplash Diquat an herbicide banned in the European Union but still widely used in the U S damages the intestines and may also trigger a harmful chain reaction in the rest of the body injuring the liver kidney and lungs according to a new review of more than 100 studies The herbicide has traditionally been studied for its toxic effects on the liver and kidneys However this review recently published May 2025 in Frontiers in Pharmacology suggests the intestines are a key target for its harmful effects Studies show that diquat weakens the intestinal barrier kills beneficial bacteria interferes with nutrient absorption and triggers chronic inflammation among other impacts These local injuries may fuel damage in distant organs through a gut organ axis making diquat s toxicity more widespread and dangerous than previously understood the researchers say That perspective builds on increasing evidence of the gut s central role in our health and its interactions with the rest of the body Similarly toxic forever chemicals that accumulate in the environment have been shown to disrupt the intestinal barrier and affect other organs Studies show that Diquat primarily enters the body through the digestive tract leading to poisoning the researchers say The core mechanism of its toxicity involves reactive oxygen species ROS induced oxidative stress which not only directly damages the intestinal barrier function but also exacerbates inflammation and systemic toxicity by disrupting the balance of the gut microbiota and the normal production of metabolic products Diquat and paraquat toxic chemical cousins The review coincides with mounting concerns about the long term health impacts of pesticides including glyphosate and atrazine especially in children and agricultural communities It also comes amid efforts by pesticide manufacturers to try to limit damage awards in lawsuits related to pesticide related illnesses and deaths and after years in which the pesticide industry sought to mislead the public about their products Bipyridyl herbicides like diquat and its highly toxic counterpart paraquat work by generating certain types of molecules reactive oxygen species or ROS that destroy cells Diquat remains active in the environment for up to 10 days in aquatic ecosystems and even longer in soil where it can be absorbed into soil particles and potentially enter the food chain the researchers say Diquat is banned in the EU Switzerland and the U K due to its environmental and health risks However like paraquat which has been linked to Parkinson s disease and whose use is

equipment PPE Herbicide harms start in the gut When ingested diquat directly damages the intestinal epithelial cells that line the gut Some of the ways diquat does this is by Shortening finger like projections villi and deepening small pits in the intestinal lining impairing nutrient absorption Generating ROS that damage tight junction proteins weakening the gut barrier and allowing toxins and pathogens to leak into the bloodstream Releasing massive amounts of pro inflammatory cytokines proteins that worsen inflammation Diquat disturbs the gut s microbial ecosystem reducing beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus while increasing harmful microbes the researchers say It also alters the production of key microbial metabolites depleting resources that fight disease and making it harder

from drinking water based on tests of both tap water and blood samples One or more types of PFAS were detected in at least 45 of the nation s tap water according to a 2023 report by the U S Geological Survey Other recent studies have reinforced health concerns about PFAS exposure One study scheduled for publication in The International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health May 2025 found that PFAS may elevate blood pressure in pregnant women even in those who otherwise have normal blood pressure increasing the odds of pregnancy complications It found higher levels of PFOS linked to increased systolic blood pressure and PFHxS linked to increased diastolic blood pressure Because of their characteristics including the propensity to propagate through the food chain accumulate and

fellows in the U S received payments from medical drug and device companies in the year before graduation jumping to 88 in the first few years after graduation For fellows in specialties that significantly rely on technology the proportion was even higher 80 received payments before graduating and 96 afterward The study of cardiology fellows provides evidence of the early targeting of physicians by industry which serves the strategic purpose of forming long term relationships that will foster familiarity uptake and allegiance to their products say co authors Dr Alice Fabbri and Dr Quinn Grundy in an editorial in The BMJ published in September Ultimately these relationships threaten the sustainability of healthcare and expose patients to unnecessary risk or harm A new report co authored by Grundy also shows that the pharmaceutical industry is targeting social media users with subtle promotional activities such as sponsored patient influencers and help seeking treatment ads

much of it does not comply with ethical and regulatory guidelines shows the study led by Jessica Mor a PhD Candidate within the Lawrence Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing at the University of Toronto

body of evidence shows that these kinds of payments gifts meals even low value meals education programs and other forms of sponsorship do affect decision making They also lead to the prescribing of brand name medications in larger volumes and higher industry profits as well as the use of devices such as stents Commercial influence undermines trust in health care and exposes patients to unnecessary risks or harms including incorrect or inappropriate care the authors say Direct to physician marketing of opioids by drug companies in the U S for example was associated with not only increased opioid prescribing rates but also elevated mortality from overdoses For trainees and early career clinicians exposure to industry influence comes at a pivotal time Doctors in training might be particularly vulnerable to the effects of drug promotion as they are still developing a professional identity and forming their practice patterns say Fabbri and Grundy Thus drug and device companies seek to cultivate familiarity and brand allegiance early and frequently through forms of sponsorship that do not always feel like promotion such as sponsored education presence of device representatives in clinical spaces and payments for training or education Similarly previous studies show the pharmaceutical industry also views nurses pharmacists dieticians and other non physician clinicians as powerful and desirable partners making them soft targets for marketing and vulnerable to the same conflicts of interest More action needed to restrict promotions protect early career clinicians and their future patients The Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC among other organizations has recommended that academic medical centers prohibit the acceptance of any gifts from

such as heart disease stroke type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life even in small doses a recent study has found BPA is a type of chemical widely found in consumer and industrial products especially in processed food and food packaging An endocrine disruptor it is known to cause hormonal problems that contribute to chronic disease as you age The study published September 2024 in the Journal of Hazardous Materials is the first of its kind to assess the relationship between BPA exposure and cardiometabolic health outcomes from childhood to adolescence using a large variety of health markers Cardiometabolic health refers to the overall health of your heart and blood vessels and your body s ability to process nutrients regulate blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight Our results point to the need to reduce exposure to BPA in the early stages of life say the researchers led by Sofia Almeida Costa at the Institute of Public Health at the University of Porto ISPUP in Portugal To gauge its effects on the body from dietary sources over time Costa and her colleagues followed 3 138 children and adolescents ages 4 to 13 from a prospective Portuguese birth cohort Bisphenol A exposure most common through diet plastics Food and beverages are considered the most significant source of human exposure to BPA Ultra processed foods for instance heavily rely on plastics for production and packaging and chemicals can migrate into food from food processing equipment and packaging among other ways In Portugal 57 of the food items consumed by the population in 2015 2016 were reported with associated packaging materials including 69 plastic materials and 3 metal After accounting for factors such as diet and energy intake the researchers found higher BPA exposure was linked to certain health risk factors including Higher blood insulin levels and insulin resistance which means the body can t use the hormone insulin properly to regular blood sugar glucose levels Higher body mass index BMI which uses height and weight to classify weight as healthy or unhealthy Increased fat mass an increased amount of body fat relative to total body weight

exactly how BPA interacts with our bodies to harm health previous research shows an association between higher levels of BPA and an increased risk of diabetes obesity high blood pressure and death

food consumption diaries and extensive collected information on sociodemographic characteristics blood biomarkers and urine samples They also adjusted for several relevant variables including total energy intake which is usually not considered researchers say Participants provided detailed information about each food and beverage consumed including their place and time food preparation method brand quantity consumed and packaging materials only for a 13 year follow up The availability of 24 hour urine samples and the highly sensitive method used to determine BPA concentrations at relatively low levels also allowed for a more precise estimate of the total daily exposure they say BPA leaves the body quickly and levels can vary throughout the day Urgent call to reduce BPA daily exposure Increased public awareness and regulation changes have reduced BPA usage in some countries but BPA substitutes BPS BPF are less studied and may have harmful health impacts The main focus of BPA regulations in the U S is food contact applications especially those designed for children Ways to avoid chemical exposures include eating homemade food when possible avoiding plastic food packaging and not using canned food and beverages The latest study has several limitations such as the better health characteristics of the eligible participants the researchers say Adolescents at the 13 year follow up may have underreported food packaging materials and types of food industry packaging material also may have changed between 2005 and 2020 when the study was conducted Lastly the single effect of BPA on multiple health outcomes may be too reductionist since consumers are exposed to a large variety of food matrix nutrients food contaminants and environmental endocrine disruptors the researchers say Still they caution that the need to globally reduce BPA daily exposure remains urgent Adverse health effects are expected when exposure chronically exceeds safety levels

progress towards ending tobacco smoking over the next three decades could extend lives and avoid millions of years of life lost worldwide making it one of the single most critical health interventions a new study shows The study represents the first model to comprehensively forecast the potential global health impacts of smoking on life expectancy It also measures years of life lost or YLLs the difference in years between life expectancy and premature death Researchers developed three scenarios to predict the future burden of smoking for all countries and all smoking related health conditions Those include cancer ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Their analysis published in The Lancet Public Health this month October 2024 shows that Based on current trends global life expectancy would likely rise to 78 3 years by 2050 up from 73 6 years in 2022 Still the forecast shows nearly 52 billion years of life lost YLL in that period If tobacco smoking steadily declined to a rate of 5 in 2050 it could add one more year of life expectancy in males and 0 2 years in females and avoid 876 million total years of life lost The immediate elimination of tobacco smoking could add 1 5 additional years of life expectancy among males and 0 4 years among females by 2050 and avoid up to 2 billion total years of life lost Together these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits benefits that will continue to grow beyond 2050 which could be achieved if countries take action to end the global tobacco epidemic the researchers say The study comes at a time when the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health reports that tobacco control is by far the most important policy that governments can adopt to help achieve a 50 reduction in the probability of premature death in their populations Researchers note the role played by the tobacco industry as a commercial determinant of health CDoH saying renewed efforts are

Health Scenarios platform with data from the Global Burden of Disease GBD study While noting wide regional variations in potential impacts they say smoking elimination even by 2050 would result in gains in life expectancy at a rate not possible by many other interventions Importantly these gains represent an average across the entire population including people who have never smoked and are therefore underestimates of the gains expected among smokers they say Among other limitations the forecast assumes that current tobacco smoking trends remain stable in the future It also estimates only the direct effects of reduced tobacco smoking on health not the health effects of second hand smoke exposure smokeless tobacco or e cigarettes It also does not account for future healthcare improvements in areas such as lung cancer detection or treatment Researchers say the majority of health gains would not be seen for several decades given the age of the first smoke free generation It would also take time for all residual risks among people who quit smoking to dissipate That could be as late as 2080 if the last smokers quit in 2050 But the time to start with new measures to stop

Endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs substances that interfere with the body s hormone systems may contribute to a wide range of female reproductive health problems including reduced fertility early or delayed puberty premature menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS according to a new review of more than 250 human and animal studies Researchers increasingly suspect that environmental toxins detected in everything from urine and blood serum to breast milk and amniotic fluid play a significant role in increasingly common female reproductive health disorders EDCs include a wide array of everyday chemicals in our environment that are produced and marketed by industry They include plastic additives such as phthalates and bisphenols in food packaging household items and personal care products as well as pesticides that contaminate soil water air and food Published recently May 2025 in Nature Reviews Endocrinology the article underscores the urgent need for stronger female reproductive health protection laws and regulations to limit EDC exposure throughout life starting in early development Reproductive health problems linked to EDCs not only increase infertility risk but may also raise the chance of other conditions like heart disease and osteoporosis The review found that endocrine disrupting chemicals impact female reproductive health in multiple ways including This Review highlights some critical processes that are essential to female reproductive health and presents compelling evidence that EDCs disrupt ovarian development and function the researchers say They noted that multiple factors can influence female fertility and reproductive health such as genetics lifestyle socioeconomic status BMI and age Still they say a growing body of evidence points to an important contribution from endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs EDCs may cause early harms that persist The findings come at a time when female reproductive disorders have steadily increased the researchers say and global female infertility rates have surged with women in their late 30s facing the highest risk The average age at which girls in the U S have their first periods has also decreased indicating a higher risk of adverse health outcomes later in life including breast cancer and type 2 diabetes Female fertility and reproductive health depend on a series of developmental

sexual development EDCs can disrupt these early stages and continue to affect reproductive health and fertility by interfering with the body s hormonal control signals reproductive organs and production of key hormones such as estrogen the researchers say For instance exposure can cause egg cells to grow too quickly stop important follicles from growing properly and increase the death of egg cells This can lead to irregular periods and may lower fertility over time Chemicals may damage early reproductive system development The effects of EDCs depend on when exposure occurs but animal and human studies show clear patterns of harm For example These studies provide causal proof for the numerous reported associations between EDC exposure in adulthood lower follicle density and premature menopause the researchers say EDCs and puberty timing sooner or later Puberty begins when the brain reactivates hormonal control pathways leading to breast development and the first period Studies over the past 30 years show a global trend of earlier puberty onset with girls starting puberty earlier worldwide by nearly three months per decade in some countries It can take years between chemical exposure and the start of puberty to study its impacts and human evidence is limited Yet some patterns indicating reproductive health harms have emerged the review shows EDCs may act like estrogen or block hormone production affecting when puberty starts Higher levels of EDCs have been linked to changes in the brain s release of gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH which helps control puberty For example BPA exposure in young rats delayed puberty and hindered the maturation of GnRH neurons In girls early exposure to BPA and DES has been linked to both early and delayed breast development but consistently delayed menstruation Phthalates which block male hormones have also been linked to delayed puberty Some EDCs may also affect puberty timing by changing how genes turn on and off across generations In one study a first generation of rats exposed to a mix of 13 EDCs had a third generation with delayed puberty and altered gene regulation PCOS and fertility treatment

chemicals like DEHP may further reduce fertility studies showed Gaps in knowledge and future research needs Despite the strong evidence proving a direct cause and effect relationship in humans is

contaminated by human made forever chemicals appears to impair children s immunity potentially increasing the risk of common childhood infections new research shows The study which appears in the March 1 2025 issue of Environmental Research is the first and largest to investigate the association between high prenatal levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS and clinically diagnosed common infections in children say the researchers led by Matilda Ebel of Lund University in Sweden The researchers investigated an unusually wide range of exposure to PFAS including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid PFOS and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid PFHxS from low level background to very high levels in a Swedish community whose drinking water had been severely contaminated They found children aged 6 months to 7 years with very high prenatal exposure had a 28 increased risk of ear infections and possibly also eye and urinary tract infections across all age groups the study shows Gender did not appear to affect the relationship between exposure and these health outcomes PFAS are endocrine disrupting chemicals commonly used in consumer products that persist in the environment and can accumulate in humans and animals They have been linked to cancer birth defects liver disease thyroid disease decreased immunity hormone disruption and a range of other serious health problems Some impacts differ based on age PFAS exposure Researchers also broke down the study by level of exposure and age from 6 months to 3 years and 4 to 7 years They say they did this for two main reasons First younger and older children may react differently to PFAS exposure because their immune systems are still developing Second parents are more likely to seek medical care for younger children which could affect the results The study shows Younger children 6 months to 3 years old may be particularly vulnerable to respiratory infection after elevated prenatal PFAS exposure Younger children with moderate PFAS exposure seemed to have a 14 reduced risk of eye infection which was not observed at higher exposure levels and a slightly higher risk of urinary tract infections On the other hand older children 4 to 7 years old had no increased risk of respiratory tract infections and may have lower risk with higher exposure The European Food Safety Agency has said that reduced immune response to vaccination is the most critical health effect of exposure to PFAS Studies have found a reduced antibody response to childhood vaccines for diphtheria tetanus rubella and

than usual called hotspots New hotspots are often found around the world and people living in these areas might be at a greater risk for health problems related to PFAS exposure the researchers say In the U S the EPA has identified more than 120 000 such locations with facilities in industries related to oil and gas work mining chemical manufacturing plastics waste management and landfill operations They also include airports fire training facilities and some military related sites according to a 2021 report in The Guardian Ronneby in the south of Sweden is one of these hotspots where drinking water was discovered in 2013 to be contaminated by a substance used in firefighting foam About one third of the households were unknowingly drinking contaminated water for a long time while the rest of the town received clean water from a different source The contaminated water had very high levels of two types of PFAS PFOS 8000 ng L and PFHxS 1700 ng L far higher than the Swedish safety limit of 90 ng L for PFAS Between 2014 and 2016 testing confirmed large differences in PFAS levels among the population the researchers say Women aged 21 38 who lived in the area with contaminated water had about three times the levels of PFOS PFHxS and PFOA in their blood compared to women in the same age group who lived in the area but got water from the clean water plant Women living in nearby areas with uncontaminated water had significantly lower levels of PFAS For this study the researchers looked at the health registry records of all children born between 2003 and 2013 before the

the mother s address before delivery to determine exposure many families in the exposed area continued to live there after birth That means the study couldn t fully compare the effects of prenatal exposure to the effects of exposure during early childhood they say More research is needed to investigate whether children born prematurely who are known to be more likely to get infections are at higher risk of infection compared to children born full term the researchers say Breastfeeding could also affect the link between prenatal PFAS exposure and infections in childhood A previous study found that high PFAS exposure was linked to shorter breastfeeding durations and this could affect the development of a child s immune system the researchers say More research on early life exposure to

misinformation and lobbying Only through strict marketing rules and restricting the industry from policymaking was some progress made in reducing smoking the researchers say though tobacco products continue to cost millions of lives The U K s 2005 Gambling Act heavily influenced by industry lobbying positioned gambling as another legitimate leisure activity and an important part of the national economy the study shows The industry funded Gambling Commission became responsible for ensuring compliance with social responsibility codes based on industry created codes of practice and had to legally consult the industry about regulatory changes This enabled the industry to expand and profit significantly especially through digital platforms reaching global markets the researchers say In 2014 four major UK gambling companies pledged to regulate themselves by limiting certain ads and forming the Senet Group to oversee these efforts However much like the former Tobacco Industry Research Committee the group primarily served industry interests by shifting the focus onto individual responsibility rather than systemic harms the researchers say It was dissolved in 2020 with its role absorbed by the Betting and Gaming Council The industry has continued to fund GambleAware formerly the Responsible Gambling Trust and other organizations that have been shown to serve primarily industry interests Last year the Labour government s 2024 election manifesto expressed a commitment to continue to work with the industry on how to ensure responsible gambling Much like tobacco

emphasis on individual actions and consumer choice rather than talking about actions at a company or industry level was an example of the way these groups worked in a similar way to industries like tobacco lobbyists says lead author Dr Alice Miller of Otago University in New Zealand In the latest gambling study the researchers say the solution needs to be comprehensive protecting research and

two decades especially those already at risk of poor birth outcomes new research shows Spurred by the introduction of genetically modified seeds by Monsanto in 1996 the use of glyphosate nationwide has increased by more than 750 In that time researchers from the University of Oregon estimate that maternal exposure to the pesticide reduced the average birth weight of babies and duration of pregnancy gestational length in rural areas where it is most prevalent Low birth weight less than 5 pounds 8 ounces and premature birth before 37 weeks are important health indicators because they are strongly associated with short and long term outcomes for newborns including infant mortality developmental disabilities and chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity They also reflect maternal well being as well as the overall health of a population including access to health care The study indicates exposure to glyphosate at the mean level of 2012 intensity Reduced average birth weight by 29 8 grams about 07 pounds Shortened pregnancy by 1 49 days Increased the chances of low birth weight by 0 65 very low birth weight by 0 20 and preterm birth by 2 14 Together these results indicate that even at the mean level of intensity in the United States glyphosate exposure significantly deteriorates infant health say co authors Emmett Reynier and Edward Rubin whose work appears January 21 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences PNAS Our findings combined with other recent work challenge the prevailing regulatory position that GM crops and their associated agricultural practices are safe and even beneficial for health The impact also disproportionately harmed babies with lower expected birth weights including those from historically disadvantaged populations the

diseases and psychological disorders Rates of MASLD and glyphosate use have surged in parallel with each other over the past three decades statistics show More than one third of people worldwide have MASLD whose prevalence has increased by 50 In that same time total herbicide use increased by roughly 280 largely driven by crops genetically modified GM to tolerate glyphosate resulting in continuous human exposure Current exposure estimates suggest that glyphosate deemed a probable human carcinogen in 2015 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer is present in about 60 of U S vegetables and in the urine of people worldwide including those with no work related exposure In addition areas of high pesticide use also tend to correlate with high rates of MASLD in people studies have shown

Why are corporate studies a problem Regulators in Europe and the United States Canada and elsewhere have repeatedly affirmed the corporate assertions of glyphosate safety These regulators have relied in part on tests that are conducted by or for the companies that have not been published or peer reviewed The corporate studies have long been kept secret even by regulators But in Europe litigation by a group of European Parliament lawmakers led to the release of dozens of such studies More than 50 corporate studies were analyzed in 2021 by independent scientists from the Institute of Cancer Research Department of Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna Armen Nersesyan and Siegfried Knasmueller Their goal was to determine if the industry studies comply with current international guidelines for chemical testing The researchers concluded that the bulk of the industry studies were outdated and did not meet current guidelines An array of shortcomings and flaws were found in the studies rendering most of them unreliable Of the 53 studies submitted to regulators by the companies only two were acceptable under current internationally recognized scientific standards Knasmueller

that number can be as much as 15 times higher Photo credit Andrej Lisakov High fructose corn syrup a sweetener commonly used in soda and ultra processed foods accelerates cancer tumor growth via the liver according to research published last week Dec 4 2024 in Nature High fructose corn syrup HFCS is a sugar derived from corn starch High fructose intake has been shown to contribute to the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and obesity both of which are associated with systemic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism the way the body processes fats It has also been linked to diabetes heart disease and colorectal cancer Cancer occurs when abnormal cells multiply uncontrollably But cancer cells as well as healthy cells can t readily use fructose directly even at high levels to fuel their growth due to the lack of an enzyme that can efficiently process it This study conducted on mice with melanoma breast cancer and cervical cancer highlights one way in which high levels of fructose consumption promote tumor growth In a process called interorgan lipid transfer when fats move between organs and tissues in the body the liver makes fructose more available to cancer cells by turning it into nutrients in the blood they can use When we think about tumors we tend to focus on what dietary components they consume directly You put something in your body and then you imagine that the tumor takes it up says Gary Patti the Michael and Tana Powell Professor of Chemistry in Arts Sciences and a professor of genetics and of medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis in a news release But humans are complex What you put in your body can be consumed by healthy tissue and then converted into something else that tumors use The study s first author Ronald Fowle Grider a postdoctoral fellow in Patti s lab agrees We quickly learned that the tumor cells alone don t tell the whole story Liver converts fructose to speed tumor growth While the whole body metabolizes glucose fructose is almost entirely metabolized by the small intestine and liver Liver cells unlike cancer cells can convert fructose into a type of fat molecule lipid called lysophosphatidylcholine LPC which enters the bloodstream the researchers say Cancer cells can then take up the available LPCs and use them to make other important molecules called phosphatidylcholines PCs These are critical for creating cell membranes which are needed for cell division and tumor growth To conduct the study the researchers added high fructose corn syrup to the

researchers added high fructose corn syrup to the diet of the mice with cancer It significantly increased their LPC blood levels and accelerated tumor growth without causing weight gain or insulin problems Similar effects have been found with zebrafish which also share genetic similarities with humans the researchers say Over the past few years it s become clear that many cancer cells prefer to take up lipids rather than make them Patti says The complication is that most lipids are insoluble in blood and require rather complex transport mechanisms LPCs are unique They might provide the most effective and efficient way to support tumor growth Blocking the enzyme that breaks down fructose in the liver didn t affect cancer cells directly However it reduced LPC levels in the blood and stopped the fructose from boosting tumor growth the researchers say We looked at numerous different cancers in various tissues throughout the body and they all followed the same mechanism Patti says Fructose speeds tumor growth but not as much as glucose To confirm that fructose itself was enough to make tumors grow faster the researchers repeated the experiment with two types of cancer cells TC 1 and CaSki Mice were either given regular diets with water containing 10 fructose or had regular food with fructose added Mice given a high fructose diet had higher levels of LPCs The study also showed that fructose directly contributes to increasing the amount of a specific type of LPC called LPC 18 1 especially in the blood more than sevenfold in fasting levels in mice given HFCS for several weeks The researchers also found Extra LPC 18 1 made cancer cells grow faster in lab tests and in mice Blocking its production slowed tumor growth Cancer cells use very little fructose

The easiest way to avoid high fructose corn syrup is to carefully read ingredient labels and eat whole unprocessed foods The researchers findings add to growing evidence that fructose can serve as an alternative fuel for cancer cells when glucose the main sugar found in blood is scarce More research is needed to determine whether other types of tumors might use dietary fructose directly for growth

avoided they say Most of the formulas that parents and caregivers feed their infants likely present a substantial risk to their infant s health and development Ultimately caregivers and infants in the US deserve a formula market that promotes healthy infant development and does not promote early obesity risk Added sugars provide energy but lack nutritional value boosting the odds of rapid infant weight gain that can eventually lead to obesity type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and other health problems They may also make babies develop a stronger preference for sweet foods increasing the risk of overeating and obesity later in life And they do not support beneficial gut bacteria as well as lactose In contrast lactose which is naturally found in breast milk cow and goat milk is perfectly designed to support an infant s nutrition immune system and gut health researchers say Because lactose digests slowly it doesn t cause the sharp spike in blood sugar that can set the stage

of finding a nutritionally suitable formula due to lax government regulations Unlike adult food products US regulations do not require that added sugars be reported on the nutrition label of infant formulas only total carbohydrates The FDA specifies 30 nutrients that must be included in infant formulas but does not regulate the types of carbohydrates or require their clear labeling That means formula manufacturers can use any type of carbohydrate including starches or added sugars such as corn syrup solids fructose and glucose Consumers are blinded to the fact that added sugars may be present in infant formulas and in what quantities the researchers say As a result parents and guardians may unknowingly feed their infants formula that contains substantial quantities of added sugars The study builds on others that revealed the high sugar content of infant formula It also comes less than a year after news reports that two of Nestlé s leading baby food brands promoted as healthy in

dangerous blood clots in deep veins Chronic exposure to common air pollutants may lead to a significantly higher risk of blood clots forming in the veins deep in your body according to a long term observational study that followed more than 6 600 adults across six major U S cities Those in areas with the highest amount of exposure to outside air pollution such as motor vehicle exhaust or smoke from forest fires and coal fired power plants face the most severe risk of developing venous thromboembolism VTE the study shows VTE is estimated to affect up to 900 000 Americans according to the CDC Left untreated these blood clots in deeper veins of the body including the lungs and leg or arm muscles can block blood flow and cause serious complications even death While earlier studies indicate a connection between air pollution and venous thromboembolism this is the most comprehensive in depth study in the U S to investigate VTE with three types of air pollutants the researchers say The study adds to mounting evidence that any level of air pollution which has long been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular ASCVD and respiratory diseases is bad for your health even during pregnancy and early childhood Importantly air pollution is ubiquitous so even modest associations can result in a large number of health events said Dr Pamela Lutsey a professor of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota What is striking is that these pollutants are very common in the air most of us breathe and they may be increasing our risk without us realizing it Even when we looked at people with no evidence of lung disease or smoking we still saw an association between air pollution and VTE risk Results of the study published Thursday Dec 12 2024 in the American Society of Hematology s Blood Journal show A 3 6 microgram per cubic meter µg m³ increase in fine particulate matter tiny air pollution particles of 2 5 micrometers or less PM 2 5 was linked to a 39 higher

exposure VTE is an umbrella term for blood clots that develop in the deeper veins of your body It consists of Deep vein thrombosis DVT which occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein of the legs arms or an internal organ Pulmonary embolism PE which occurs when a blood clot breaks off from a deep vein and travels to the lungs Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension among other complications may also occur after a PE with a large clot It stops blood from reaching the lungs and can be fatal This latest research is part of the Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis MESA which recruited participants in 2000 2002 They ranged in age from 45 to 84 years old and came from four groups white Black Hispanic and of Chinese ancestry Half were female All lived in or near New York Baltimore Chicago Los Angeles Minneapolis and Winston Salem North Carolina Throughout the study researchers updated air pollution metrics in each community every two weeks They also followed participants assessing their exposures over an average of nearly 17 years between 2000 and 2018 The researchers then compared those with the highest exposure to air pollutants the top 75 to those with the lowest the bottom 25 They found people in the top percentile had 43 greater risk of developing VTE with elevated PM 2 5 exposure exposure 2 8 great risk with elevated NO 2 exposure exposure 2 3

shows the study which was published in the journal Tobacco Control February 2025 The alarming findings come at a critical time just weeks after the FDA under the Trump administration withdrew a proposed Biden era ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars amid tobacco industry pressure These findings do not imply that non menthol cigarettes are safer mortality risks were highest for continued smoking of both menthol and non menthol cigarettes for all studied causes whereas quitting both types substantially lowered risk the researchers say On the contrary our findings of a unique excess mortality risk associated with menthol flavouring in cigarettes provide additional scientific evidence apart from their known impacts on initiation and cessation in support of the menthol flavour regulation in the USA and in low and middle income countries Menthol naturally found in peppermint or made in a lab makes tobacco products even more addictive and harder to quit It alters how the brain senses taste and pain creating a cooling effect that makes cigarette smoke feel smoother and easier to inhale Menthol in cigarettes is an established public health threat due to its effect on increasing smoking uptake and reducing smoking cessation says lead author Dr Priti Bandi director of cancer risk factors and screening research at the American Cancer Society With these results

Of the participants 73 486 smoked menthol cigarettes and 281 680 smoked non menthol cigarettes In that time 4 071 menthol smokers and 20 738 non menthol smokers died The study fills a major evidence gap regarding additional disease risks conferred by menthol flavouring in cigarettes the researchers say They suggested the additional health risks of menthol may be more difficult to detect while someone is currently smoking given the severe harms of tobacco itself They also found Both menthol and non menthol smokers had similar mortality risks about twice as high as those who never smoked However quitting smoking significantly reduced the risk of death for both groups Current menthol smokers had similar mortality risks to non menthol smokers except for those smoking 40 or more cigarettes per day and for Black individuals who experienced significantly higher risks for some heart diseases Federal law in the U S does not allow tobacco companies to sell cigarettes with added flavors except for menthol and regular tobacco flavors but some states have added restrictions on flavored tobacco sales Tobacco companies meanwhile have downplayed the health risks of menthol and

marine scientist Prof Richard C Thompson in a review paper published last month September 2024 in the journal Science two decades after he coined the term microplastics Public concern is increasing and diverse measures to address microplastics pollution are being considered in international negotiations Clear evidence on the efficacy of potential solutions is now needed to address the issue and to minimize the risks of unintended consequences Microplastic describes the tiny bits of plastic particles typically 5mm or smaller that persist in the natural environment from sources such as tires textiles plastic coated fertilizers and paint It s found in food and drink and everywhere from deep sea sediments reef building corals and the summit of Mount Everest to human breast milk placental

Packaging may also shed secondary microplastic debris into products say University of Birmingham researchers in a study published last month September 2024 in the Journal of Hazardous Materials A lack of testing on microplastic in leave on cosmetics and personal care products means significant aspects of microplastic contamination are not investigated even though they are purchased more than rinse

that critical knowledge gaps remain Thompson directs the Marine Institute at the University of Plymouth in England and founded and heads its International Marine Litter Research Unit which charted the global distribution of microplastic from Arctic sea ice to the deep seas For example researchers have yet to determine the rate at which large plastic macroplastic breaks down into microplastic and the extent to which microplastic potentially fragments into even smaller particles nanoplastic The time required for plastic to convert into mineral substances is also unknown The research gap in microplastic in leave on cosmetic and personal care items in particular could be due to the difficulty of testing these types of products They contain more ingredients and complex formulations than their rinse off counterparts researchers say Locations in the human body where microplastics have been reported Credit Richard C Thompson Scientists recommend Research and regulatory testing should include both rinse off and leave on cosmetic and personal care products and more balance in the types of plastics and species studied For example 62 of all toxicity assessments use polystyrene or polyethylene particles says Thompson Results should report both the number and mass of detected microplastics to more accurately calculate environmental and human exposure burdens and inform any policy changes and assessments Proposed and emerging alternatives to plastic should undergo early assessment using safe and sustainable design principles to address problems before they reach the market Comprehensive regulations and monitoring of all cosmetic microplastics are also needed according to the new studies Global regulatory frameworks currently focus on microplastic emissions of rinse off products only In the U S for instance the Microbead Free Waters Act of 2015 prohibited the manufacturing packaging and distribution of rinse off cosmetics that contain plastic microbeads It

Scientists are increasingly documenting microplastic in commercial marine and freshwater species raising health risks for animals and humans along with environmental justice concerns for people who rely on subsistence fishing or for whom seafood is an important food source Previous research by Granek for instance focused on microplastic concentrations in Pacific oysters and razor clams along the Oregon coast On average each oyster contained about 11 microplastic pieces while each razor clam had about nine Nearly all were microfibers which can come from clothing made from synthetic or natural materials and run down fishing gear Another study conducted in Portugal showed that eating microplastic including polyethylene and polyester can lead to brain damage and harm to cells tissues and DNA in wild fish The PSU researchers note that they had a small sample size of larger fish and collected fish only from the Oregon coast that had economic historic or cultural importance in the state However when compared to other studies on microplastics in fish muscle tissue our results are similar to the levels found in fish around the world they say For producers and handlers of seafood we recommend shifting to alternative packaging methods such as natural materials made from beeswax starches or sugars that will limit the introduction of APs into retail seafood the researchers say For

contaminating the air water and food with microplastics and toxic chemicals that harm health Photo Credit Kirti Nagar for Unsplash Tiny bits of plastic pollution are found all across the natural

and the food system The chemicals in micro and nano plastics MNPs cause a plethora of health impacts including harming people s hormonal systems leading to infertility and neurological and behavior disorders among other issues says a new review which unpacks the mechanisms of how plastics harm health Typically people consume microplastics from contaminated food and drinking water ingesting around 50 000 particles each year People can also inhale micro and nano plastics and absorb them through skin contact Most microplastics in the atmosphere come from the wear and tear of vehicle tires and brake pads Researchers estimate that the harmful health effects from toxic chemicals in microplastics cost the United States nearly 250 billion in health care expenses in one year To tackle the plastic epidemic and its health harms scientists and health advocates are pushing for world leaders to commit to curb plastic production in a legally binding United Nations treaty due to be voted on next month in Geneva Switzerland The plastics and fossil fuel industry objects to curbs on production arguing instead for more recycling But scientists and pollution advocates say that very little plastic is ever recycled and doing so adds to the spread of toxic chemicals in the plastics We are already seeing the impacts of plastic pollution on our health and our children s health The solution

lasting changes in the brain s white matter which plays an essential role in the nervous system Another recent study involving more than 8 500 children ages 9 to 10 and published Oct 30 2024 in

pattern recognition and visual spatial reasoning The significant association demonstrates that air pollution can affect a child s cognitive function even at extremely low levels that are considered safe by current air quality standards she says Societal consequences of children s cognitive decline Additionally the impact of IQ loss attributable to PM 2 5 exposure becomes more profound when considered at the population level Whitman says PM 2 5 concentrations are often disproportionately higher in low income and marginalized communities meaning children in these areas are more likely to be affected by the cognitive impacts of pollution and less likely to have the resources to mitigate adverse outcomes A population wide reduction in mean mental abilities by as little as five IQ points results in a more than 50 decrease in the number of children with superior intelligence IQ above 130 It also leads to a corresponding increase in the number of children with IQ scores below 70 the researchers say With approximately 2 2 billion children worldwide even modest increases in pollution can result in a significant excess number of children experiencing cognitive declines potentially affecting their academic performance and future opportunities Whitman says The potential for total losses in cognitive function due to PM 2 5 given its prevalence could be as large or more prominent than those caused by exposures to other widespread neurotoxins such as lead and methylmercury researchers say The chemicals in flame retardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs and pesticides also are associated with children s cognitive loss Significant loss of cognitive capacity in a population represents a massive erosion of human capital the researchers say At the same time the

Published this month in Environment International the study from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is the first to show that everyday polyurethane PUR and polyvinyl chloride PVC plastics contain compounds that can disrupt the body s internal clock circadian rhythm by quickly interfering with a specific cell signal A 1 R linked to sleep and light Unlike previous research that focused on slow hormone related effects this study reveals a faster direct impact on key clock genes through a different kind of biological pathway That means plastic chemicals may contribute to serious health problems like diabetes or cancers in more ways than scientists currently know the researchers say All of our cells follow a circadian rhythm and the chemicals found in plastics can change that rhythm Importantly these chemicals are making rapid changes in our cells that can turn into sustained changes over longer periods of time says lead author Molly Young McPartland Circadian

study highlights a new potential impact disrupting the timing of two key genes that help control the body s internal clock The delays are less powerful than what happens after caffeine consumption or bedtime exposure to light the researchers note Many factors also affect how sensitive an individual may be to both internal and external signals that control the body clock However long term frequent exposure to plastic chemicals especially through food packaging makes the potential impact more concerning the researchers say When repeated daily and combined with other environmental disruptions exposure could shift the timing of key body processes that contribute to negative health impacts over time they say Caffeine wakes us up plastics do the opposite For this study the researchers tested chemical mixtures extracted from polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride on U20S lab cells These cells are derived from a human bone cancer osteosarcoma cell line that is often used to study how biological clocks work at the cellular level What they found involves a type of protein called the adenosine A 1 receptor A 1 R which is found on the surface of cells throughout the body especially in the brain the researchers say A 1 R has a well established link to the sleep wake cycle and uses the same pathways in the body that respond to light In humans caffeine blocks A 1 R to keep us awake but plastic chemicals appear to quickly activate it the researchers found When A 1 R is activated it lowers levels of a molecule that plays a key role in keeping the circadian clock running smoothly This in turn delays two clock genes which are essential for maintaining the body s daily rhythms The study was done in vitro outside the body in a lab so the results might not apply directly to humans However the researchers say the findings provide strong evidence that the chemicals in PUR and PVC plastics disrupt the molecular clock because the effects changed with the dose and could be reversed

and moral distress they say PE s push for rapid revenue growth and quick exits generally means that PE is not adding value to patient care Sacrificing care for cash Private equity firms typically acquire companies and sell them for high returns within three to seven years a quick turnaround that often involves restructuring such as cutting costs and targeting specific services to raise prices It can result in merging or selling health care businesses and their assets which can severely deplete medical resources and undermine care quality and access for those in need studies show PE ownership has also been shown to negatively impact physicians who may lose independent control over clinical decisions and the future generation of medical trainees who face job loss and financial instability Bankruptcies too like Steward Health Care have shuttered PE owned hospitals in several states jeopardizing not just individual patients but entire communities access to care For instance

especially for vulnerable populations recent studies and reports suggest Evidence pinpointed in a multiagency federal report issued in January 2025 by the Department of Health and Human Services suggests that PE firms pursue cost cutting too quickly leading to patient safety issues and reductions in quality A bipartisan Senate Budget Committee report released that same month January 2025

There really is an urgent need for greater transparency monitoring and regulatory oversight Medicare patients who had lung surgery resection at private equity owned hospitals were more likely to suffer serious complications stay longer and die within 30 days of surgery More patients also had to be readmitted within 30 days Collectively these findings suggest that the higher rates of adverse outcomes at private equity owned hospitals may be driven by changes to hospital resources and infrastructure characteristic of private equity acquisition that relates to poorer quality of surgical care the researchers say More than 9 400 Medicare patients who underwent complex esophageal surgery esophagectomy at PE owned hospitals had significantly higher 30 day death rates more and more serious complications and were more likely to die after complications occurred compared to non PE owned health centers Lower quality surgical care may be influenced by PE ownership negatively impacting the number of complex surgeries performed the nurse to patient ratio and teaching hospital status Second worse postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing esophagectomy at private equity acquired institutions call into question the appropriateness of whether these institutions should provide high complexity surgical care the authors say PE owned home health agencies HHAs were better

instead on aesthetic clinicians who provide non surgical treatments Although PE investment brings financial and operational advantages it raises concerns about healthcare quality and equity the

study that looked at 80 different reports involving nearly 20 000 children and teenagers food ads especially online ones were linked to eating more unhealthy food wanting those foods and asking parents to buy them pester behaviors Another found that influencer marketing of junk food significantly increased immediate food intake among 9 11 year olds while healthy food promotions had no such effect Unlike traditional media social platforms like TikTok YouTube and Instagram track user behavior to deliver personalized content And because ads can be embedded in videos polls games or quizzes particularly on platforms like TikTok YouTube and Instagram children often fail to recognize they re being marketed to The study found that digital marketing techniques have a near universal reach and effectively promote unhealthy food consumption which significantly influence children and adolescents consumption and food behavior the researchers say Social media is a commercial determinant of health like tobacco alcohol In the U S more than 95 of adolescents have a smartphone or access to one with more than 35 reporting using one of the top five most popular social media platforms almost constantly according to the Pew Research Center Similarly in the U K nine in 10 children own a mobile phone by age 11 Nearly a quarter of children aged 5 7 also have their own phone with more than one third on social media In Australia where legislators in November approved a ban on children under 16 from using social media roughly one million teens aged 14 17 91 and more than half 54 of children aged 10 to 13 own a mobile phone according to a 2023 survey One in seven 14 children aged 6 to 9 has their own social media account The review comes amid emerging evidence that the social media

evidence that the social media industry acts as a commercial determinant of health CDoH that facilitates food marketing while reshaping public perceptions and advancing corporate goals Like other recognized CDoHs like tobacco alcohol and fossil fuels the food industry uses similar tactics on social media to influence public health policy and sidestep regulation the researchers say This includes targeting vulnerable populations building alliances with health groups advocating for voluntary regulation and reframing public health debates in their favor Australian researchers for instance found that ultra processed food industry actors used Twitter to challenge public health policies and advocate for voluntary regulation while co opting health related language and distorting policy narratives This study is also the first to explore how the industry promotes ultra processed products to young audiences exacerbating health disparities and contributing to adverse health outcomes including childhood obesity Childhood obesity increases the risk of developing non communicable diseases NCDs including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease The role of social media marketing in influencing high energy intake including bypassing cognitive awareness to shape the food environment for children and youth is consistent with the definition of an obesogenic environment driver the authors say Adolescents encounter dozens of unhealthy food ads online every day In this study researchers from the U K Canada and New Zealand analyzed 36 peer reviewed articles and editorials mostly from high income countries published between 2000 and May 2023 They found that exposure to unhealthy food marketing on social media varies by country age and gender In a self reported study of 4 827 parents of children under 18 for example those in Mexico and the U S reported greater exposure to marketing for fast food and sugary drinks while viewing digital media with their children compared with parents in Australia Canada and the UK Older children and those from some countries may also be more exposed than other groups As early adopters and near ubiquitous users

food promotions per week based on mobile device recordings the study shows Boys were more likely to encounter ads emphasizing athleticism or achievement while girls saw more interactive content like polls and quizzes In Canada 72 of youth aged 7 16 were exposed to food marketing within 10 minutes of using their favorite social media apps On that country s most used websites for children more than 93 of food ads promoted items high in fat sodium or sugar with the most frequently advertised categories including cakes cookies and ice cream Researchers also estimated that children and adolescents see food marketing 30 and 189 times on average per week on social media apps respectively Food marketers quickly adapt to changing conditions such as the COVID 19 pandemic using relevant themes to stay visible and influential In New Zealand 14 of the top 20 unhealthy food and drink brands posted COVID themed content during the pandemic Instagram marketing tactics tended to appeal to a younger audience by using competitions and characters compared with Facebook advertisements that tended to include competitions based on user generated content interactive games and apps Social media platforms evading effective regulation The WHO has long warned that food marketing is a public health threat that negatively affects children s food choices intended choices and their dietary intake In July 2023 it released a new guideline that recommends countries implement comprehensive mandatory policies to protect children of all ages from the marketing of foods and non alcoholic beverages that are high in saturated fatty acids trans fatty acids free sugars and or salt HFSS This review reinforces that warning and calls for urgent government led reforms to better protect youth online

on companies that advertise commodities linked to public health harms including food tobacco and alcohol Tech companies are currently seeking to overturn a state law in Florida that bans some social media accounts for teens younger than 16 or for 14 and 15 year olds without a parent s permission But regulation to protect children is needed the researchers say Unhealthy food regulations for children and adolescents have not kept up with the changing digital marketing landscape particularly with the rise of social media and it is evident that the same regulations and regulatory approaches that were employed for traditional media sources will not be effective across the digital world they say Recommendations include Clear definitions of child targeted digital marketing International collaboration to close regulatory loopholes Mandatory restrictions on unhealthy food promotion to minors Media literacy education to build critical thinking in youth Stronger systems to track and monitor online ad exposure Parents too have a role to play by initiating conversations about how digital marketing works and encouraging media literacy However researchers caution that individual efforts are unlikely to be enough without systemic reforms Given the review s finding that self regulatory policies are ineffective parents and guardians should advocate for government regulations to

instances greater health risks than microparticles MPs are roughly up to 10 times larger but still only about the size of a fine grain of sand Because of their extremely small size nanoparticles have a large surface area to volume ratio which means they break down or dissolve faster and can more easily penetrate cells and tissues They also tend to linger in the body longer which may explain their stronger potential to disrupt normal biological functions the researchers note The 12 week intervention was long enough to detect short term metabolic disruptions researchers say but more studies are

look smell and taste Scientists have linked consumption of ultra processed foods UPFs to obesity and other health issues such as cancer and diabetes Now they are starting to discover why people eat more UPFs and gain excessive weight Filippa Juul a nutritional epidemiologist at Downstate Health Sciences University part of the State University of New York led a recent review of the evidence Juul is a leading researcher on the impacts of UPFs on cardiovascular disease and on obesity and weight gain Juul talked to U S Right to Know about her findings What is the evidence linking ultra processed food to obesity Multiple studies have followed people over time and seen that those who eat a diet high in ultra processed foods tend to be at higher risk of gaining weight or becoming obese There is also a landmark experimental study that tested if eating a diet high in ultra processed foods would lead to greater energy intake and weight gain compared to a diet based on minimally processed foods or whole foods if the two diets contained the same number of calories and macronutrients Previously people assumed that UPFs would lead to weight gain because they tend to be higher in sugar and fat and low in fiber But in the experimental study that published in 2019 in the journal Cell Metabolism 20 participants at a research hospital in Bethesda Maryland spent two weeks on a diet high in UPF and then two weeks on a diet free from UPF The food offered in both diets were matched for total calories and macronutrients and participants could eat as much or as little as they wanted The study found that people on the UPF diet unconsciously ate about 500 more calories and gained more weight These patients didn t rate the food as tasting better nor indicated they were hungrier at the start of the meal or more full at the end of the meal The study which was led by Kevin Hall a nutrition and neuroscientist who recently retired from the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and

calories per day compared to a traditional Japanese diet This is the strongest evidence we have got It is quite consistent Why do ultra processed foods make people eat more and gain weight This is still not fully understood but there are several hypotheses that are supported by the evidence One is that ultra processed foods tend to have a higher energy density per gram they contain more calories When food contains more calories in a smaller volume we tend to eat more of it before we feel full Also ultra processed foods tend to have softer texture so people can eat them more quickly This means our energy intake rate is higher and the UPF foods are less satiating so we tend to eat more Another reason is because UPFs can be hyperpalatable That is food that has combinations of nutrients such as fats and salt or sugar and fats or carbohydrate and salt at levels over a certain threshold For example potato chips have fat and salt but not all potato chips are hyperpalatable This doesn t necessarily mean that consumers think they taste better It means they are very rewarding and makes people want them more and eat more Another potential mechanism is that nutrients in UPFs are more easily absorbed and tend to be taken up in the first part of the small intestine This leads to lower release of appetite regulating hormones that are triggered when nutrients reach a more distal part of the small intestine What else do we need to know We don t have as much experimental evidence as we would like We need more controlled feeding studies like the study by Hall and colleagues This would enable scientists to specifically look at changes in gut microbiome and biomarkers for example to tease out which factors in these foods promote weight gain and obesity One big question that scientists are asking is if there is something inherent in the type of processing used to manufacture these foods that means people should avoid all ultra processed foods Or are there certain things we can tweak such as eliminating certain additives to make them healthier We also need to understand better how ultra processed food impacts individuals at critical life stages such as

stricter regulations on the marketing of these foods to children and youth We have very strong evidence that eating a diet based on nutritious whole food including vegetables fruits legumes whole grains fish and nuts makes us healthier I don t think we need to reinvent the wheel by engineering ultra processed foods with qualities that mimic whole foods But people who are in the business of

aging new study shows Body clock health concept as a 3D illustration Photo iStock Ultra processed foods can accelerate aging and the decline of your body s health even if you generally eat healthy foods say Italian researchers in a new report based on the largest population study of its kind in Europe And it s not necessarily for the reason you might think It may be due more to the potentially harmful ways these foods are highly processed and packaged by industry than their poor nutritional content Making ultra processed food typically involves high temperature cooking among other processes that can expose our bodies to toxic chemicals and plastics A high consumption of ultra processed foods not only has a negative impact on health in general but could also accelerate aging itself suggesting a connection that goes beyond the poor nutritional quality of these foods says first author Simona Esposito a researcher at the Scientific Institute for Research Hospitalization and Health Care IRCCS Neuromed in Pozzilli which conducted the study with the Libera Università Mediterranea LUM University of Casamassima The report published today Nov 6 2024 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition comes at a time of increased interest in ways to delay or reverse aging It also comes amid a growing body of scientific evidence that ultra processed foods UPFs put individuals at greater risk for chronic health conditions like Type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease and erode our body s ability to voluntarily control how much and how often we consume them Unlike minimally processed naturally occurring foods ultra processed foods are designed by industry to contain artificially high levels of rapidly absorbed refined carbohydrates like sugar and white flour salt and unhealthy fats along with other additives Some UPFs can be as addictive as cigarettes alcohol and cocaine studies have shown Neurologically speaking highly processed foods can act like a traditional addictive drug says Haley Krupa the lead author of a recent study on food addiction September 2024 They can stimulate reward pathways in the brain that parallel those triggered by drug use increasing the risk of dependency Chronological versus biological aging While actual chronological age starts at your date of birth biological age is a kind of internal clock that reflects the actual health

association of UPF consumption and markers of biological aging Researchers analyzed 36 circulating blood biomarkers among nearly 22 500 middle aged and elderly Italians male and female Participants were recruited from the Moli sani Study The researchers also assessed diet quality and estimated participants consumption of ultra processed foods over the previous year based on a food frequency questionnaire with 248 questions about 188 different food items Limitations of the study may include the potential for participants to accurately recall items and assess portion size researchers noted though they excluded participants with implausible food intakes and adjustments The most popular UPFs among the cohort were processed meat 17 6 cakes pies pastries 14 2 and fruit drinks 10 9 Our results showed that the UPFs biological aging association was weakly explained by the poor nutritional composition of these highly processed foods suggesting that biological aging could be mainly influenced by nonnutrient food characteristics the researchers say Those characteristics include the potential of industrial UPF processing to produce Harmful chemicals such as acrylamide during high temperature cooking Other toxic compounds such as furans and advanced glycation end products AGEs that alter the structure and function of proteins related to aging Exposure to endocrine disruptors including bisphenols and phthalates through plastic packaging Other age related effects of highly processed foods Other impacts may occur too Industrial processing deconstructs the natural architecture of food and adds other substances That may affect how our bodies absorb and respond to what we consume including how your body uses and stores blood sugars glucose the researchers say Modifications to the physical structure of the food matrix during processing as well as usage of food additives including emulsifiers and nonnutritive sweeteners may alter gut microbiota composition and function and impair glucose tolerance they say And this may trigger inflammatory processes and increase susceptibility to age related chronic diseases References Esposito S Gialluisi A Di

Organization WHO calls an alarming surge in youth vaping In the US e cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product last year 2024 among middle and high school students with 5 9 reporting current use The legal minimum age to purchase tobacco products including e cigarettes is 21 Concerns about e cigarettes most of which contain nicotine have grown as evidence suggests vaping can damage lungs as much as smoking Studies show e cigarettes produce harmful chemicals and toxic metals linked to cancer and lung and cardiovascular disease Their use has also been linked to depression and anxiety even as the tobacco industry aggressively markets addictive products to children and teens Researchers in the new study reviewed 52 systematic reviews of individual studies and four umbrella reviews published between 2016 and 2024 adjusting results for factors such as sex age socioeconomic status and family or peer smoking Other key findings included Vapers were three to six times more likely to use marijuana four to more than six times more likely to drink alcohol and over four to nearly seven times more likely to binge drink Vaping was tied to a 20 36 higher risk of being diagnosed with asthma and a 44 higher risk of worsening symptoms Coughing was also consistently associated with e cigarette use More than 50 cases of serious vaping related lung injury EVALI were

THC the ingredient in marijuana that creates the feeling of being high The new study also highlighted mental health and other impacts Three reviews linked vaping to suicidal thoughts or behaviors while six reported injuries mainly from vape explosions Others suggested potential links to pneumonia bronchitis reduced sperm counts dizziness headaches migraines and oral health problems such as dry mouth and gum bleeding Our review provides the most comprehensive picture to date on the range of risks vaping poses to young people said Dr Greg Hartwell co author and clinical assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine In particular we found consistent evidence around transitions to smoking which of course in turn opens the door to the multitude of harms that conventional cigarettes bring Although smoking rates have fallen as vaping has risen researchers noted declines are largely due to bans taxes and stricter sales and packaging rules They found little evidence for the so called diversion effect which would mean vapers are less likely to smoke than non vapers Addiction was largely absent from the reviews yet most e cigarettes contain nicotine which is highly addictive Another gap the study noted was how nicotine may affect adolescent brain development Much of the evidence beyond smoking risk came from cross sectional studies which make it harder to judge the long term impacts the researchers cautioned They called for urgent long term studies on vaping s effects on brain heart and oral health as well as its dual use with cigarettes and stronger protections for young people Our findings support the implementation of policy measures to restrict sales and marketing of e cigarettes to young people and restrictions on advertising design features that are designed for or likely to appeal to young people the authors said Such efforts may form part of a wider set of measures to restrict harms including raising the public s and young people s awareness of these harms and counter marketing to raise public and policy awareness of the marketing and strategies that e cigarette companies have targeted at children and young people",

Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know Our nation s policy on genetically engineered food is the product of President George H W Bush s vice president Dan Quayle Quayle is perhaps best remembered for misspelling the word potato in a spelling bee and for his work as the Bush administration s regulation terminator 1 But his most important legacy was his giant favor to the agrichemical industry and its genetically engineered foods and crops Under the Quayle policy the FDA does not test the safety of genetically engineered food It does not certify that these foods are safe Rather Quayle s policy allows industry to get away with self policing of health risks As Jason Dietz a policy analyst at FDA explains It s the manufacturer s responsibility to insure that the product is safe 2 Here s how the Quayle policy on genetically engineered food came about As vice president under President Reagan George H W Bush expressed his support for deregulation of genetically engineered foods In a 1987 walkthrough of Monsanto s St Louis laboratories when Monsanto s regulatory concerns came up Bush responded Call me I m in the dereg business I can help 3 Two years later when Bush became President he was in an excellent position to help On March 31 1989 he created the White House Council on Competitiveness and put his vice president Dan Quayle in charge of it The Washington Post called Quayle s regulatory relief task force a command post for a war against government regulation of American business It called Quayle a zealot when it comes to deregulation 4 According to the Post Word quickly spread through the business community that the Competitiveness Council was ready and able to help on regulatory matters and its agenda filled up The Quayle regulatory relief task force intervened in countless regulatory battles including efforts to change regulations on federal rules relating to commercial aircraft noise bank liability on property loans housing accessibility for the disabled clothing makers right to work at home disclosure requirements on pensions protection of underground water from landfill runoff reporting requirements for child care facilities located in religious institutions and fees for real estate settlements 5 Here s how the New York Times described the political process that led to the Quayle policy on genetically engineered food In the weeks and months that followed the White House complied working behind the scenes to help Monsanto long a

political power with deep connections in Washington get the regulations that it wanted It was an outcome that would be repeated again and again through three administrations What Monsanto wished for from Washington Monsanto and by extension the biotechnology industry got If the company s strategy demanded regulations rules favored by the industry were adopted And when the company abruptly decided that it needed to throw off the regulations and speed its foods to market the White House quickly ushered through an unusually generous policy of self policing Even longtime Washington hands said that the control this nascent industry exerted over its own regulatory destiny through the Environmental Protection Agency the Agriculture Department and ultimately the Food and Drug Administration was astonishing 6 James Maryanski the former biotechnology coordinator for FDA s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition explained the White House s involvement Basically the government had taken a decision that it would not create new laws Yes it was a political decision It was a very broad decision that didn t apply to just foods It applied to all products of biotechnology 7 On May 26 1992 Vice President Quayle himself announced our nation s policy on genetically engineered foods and crops as a deregulatory initiative The reforms we announce today will speed up and simplify the process of bringing better agricultural products developed through biotech to consumers food processors and farmers Mr Quayle said We will ensure that biotech products will receive the same oversight as other products instead of being hampered by unnecessary regulation 8 Quayle said that the United States was the world leader in biotechnology and that the government wanted to keep it that way 9 Of course the Quayle policy was lax as intended No food safety laws or regulations were proposed or promulgated The FDA merely issued a guidance that establishes a process for voluntary consultations on safety The Quayle policy did not require mandatory pre market or post market safety testing of genetically engineered food In essence the agrichemical industry got exactly what it wanted the appearance of regulation without the actuality of it An article in Nature explained The biotechnology companies wanted government regulators to help persuade consumers that their products were safe yet they also wanted the regulatory hurdles to be set as low as possible 10 Henry Miller the founding director of the FDA s Office of Biotechnology explained the outcome quite bluntly In this area regulation of

Under the Quayle policy agrichemical companies were not even required to notify the FDA of a new genetically engineered food or product That minor requirement was added in 2001 12 And so it is

failed to disclose his pesticide industry ties The organic hit piece by Henry I Miller ran in Newsweek several months after the New York Times revealed that an article in Forbes with Miller s name on it had been ghostwritten by Monsanto Forbes severed its ties with Millerand deleted all his articles from their site Miller disclosed none of that in his Newsweek piece even though he spent several paragraphs attacking Danny Hakim the New York Times reporter who revealed the ghostwriting scandal Miller made false claims about organic farming using pesticide industry sources The op ed went downhill from there using pesticide industry sources to make false claims about organic farming and attacking people who appeared on a target list that had been developed for Monsanto by Jay Byrne

others consider incidents on a case by case basis Standards advocated by professional societies also seem to differ Some outlets apply different standards to reporters and columnists as I learned when

documents reported in our Merchants of Poison case study details how companies like Bayer and the pesticide industry broadly spend tens of millions of dollars every year on tactics to mislead the public about its products and the sector Like the tactics of the tobacco and fossil fuel industries the methods Monsanto and Bayer used to protect glyphosate are designed to thwart independent scientific examination and regulatory oversight These tactics are also used to distract the public and policymakers from grappling with the systemic changes needed to address the impacts of glyphosate and pesticides more generally on ecosystems and public health This final excerpt from Merchants of Poison offers six suggestions for policy makers media outlets academics and public health advocates to counteract industry spin tactics These recommendations are just some of what is urgently needed to rein in the disinformation spread by the pesticide industry to influence public policies and mislead the public across the globe We offer these not as an exhaustive set of recommendations but as examples of actions needed to curtail industry influence 1 Understand and expose industry PR strategies Merchants of Poison adds to a growing body of research and reporting on pesticide industry disinformation tactics and more broadly to the literature and social science field of agnotology that uncovers how polluting industries manufacture ignorance and doubt and influence public policy around critical health issues A key to upending the narratives of these companies is to understand their PR strategies and expose them Doing so helps to inoculate the public and policymakers from their persuasive power As Louis Brandeis wrote in Harper s magazine in 1913 Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants Internal corporate documents have made clear how long the fossil fuel industry knew about the dangers of the climate crisis and how long the tobacco industry knew about the deadliness of cigarettes In recent years massive public education campaigns have focused on teaching this history As an investigation into corporate documents reveals that Exxon knew about climate change a half a century ago yet the company s public communications as a Harvard study documents promoted doubt on the matter and contradicted its own scientific data From the internal Monsanto and Bayer documents it s clear the company was aware that glyphosate herbicide formulations posed a risk to human health and ecosystems and yet worked to suppress evidence about these threats Beyond the Monsanto Bayer case there is a robust literature showing how pesticide companies have also known about the human health and environmental impacts of other pesticides including paraquat neonicotinoids atrazine and chlorpyrifos yet have long worked to suppress or deny the science It s crucial for the public and policymakers to understand that the pesticide industry has known about these threats for

and challenged for they risk alongside other industry disinformation robbing us of crucial time to deploy real solutions for reversing climate change 2 Scientific journals must bolster their integrity As we discussed in Tactic 1 shaping the scientific literature is a key industry disinformation tactic Ghostwriting or otherwise covertly influencing journal content is one powerful tool to do so To maintain the integrity of peer reviewed journals it s critical at a minimum to clearly divulge those conflicts when they occur Unfortunately this transparency is still not consistent Just to give one example four out of five authors of a 2018 paper in the peer reviewed journal Food and Chemical Toxicology that significantly downplayed the dietary risk of eating foods with pesticide residues noted their employment by Bayer but they did not declare this affiliation as a conflict of interest Like other scientific journals Food and Chemical Toxicology has clear guidelines for its authorship All

journalists has a comprehensive code of ethics which includes Identify sources clearly The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources Many reporters do just that they vet whether to report on studies or quote so called experts with conflicts of interest if the integrity of the science or source could be questionable They do things like follow the money behind the funding of think tanks housed at academic institutions The Merchants of Poison report includes many examples of journalists doing just such digging to expose these funding streams Unfortunately thorough vetting isn t ubiquitous and when a media outlet fails to do this robust source excavation or when a news outlet relies on or reports information from an astroturf group or front group without disclosing their conflicts of interests the media can end up being a pawn in an industry public relations campaign As one example of an effort to hold media accountable in 2017 two dozen public interest groups wrote to USA Today editors raising concerns that the paper was publishing science columns by members of the American Council on Science and Health ACSH without identifying that group as a corporate front group with a history of spinning science for corporate benefactors As we described earlier internal documents establish that Monsanto paid ACSH in 2015 to help defend glyphosate USA Today editors declined to take action for years afterward the paper s opinion section board of contributors included Alex Berezow ACSH s vice president of

fuel companies too pour money into prestigious universities according to a 2022 investigation by the BMJ in an attempt to weaken messages on climate change capture academia and protect their interests The BMJ also describes a growing student movement to end fossil fuel funding on campuses across the country Pesticide and food industry funding at universities similarly deserves scrutiny As we describe in this report the pesticide industry relies heavily on universities and professors to assist with their product defense campaigns and public universities professors and researchers depend on funding from large multinational food and chemical companies This dependence shapes research agendas and communications and messaging in ways that often benefit corporate profits at the expense of public health But there is plenty students on campus can do to challenge this and it starts with asking questions and doing research There are many resources for students to raise questions on their campuses U S Right to Know has a toolkit for students on how to uncover the influence of the food and pesticide industries on campus The toolkit explains how to use Freedom of Information laws and other strategies to uncover corporate within universities what questions to ask and other strategies for leading campaigns for transparency on campuses Both at the state and national levels stronger transparency laws are needed The Physician Payment Sunshine Act passed in 2013 requires drug and medical product manufacturers to disclose payments and other items of value given to physicians and

Meisel and Jamie Henn launched the Clean Creatives campaign housed within the nonprofit Fossil Free Media The campaign calls on PR firms and ad agency executives to divest from fossil fuel contracts and pledge to only work with businesses who support climate solutions As the campaign s founders write Unless the entire ecosystem of agencies creatives and clients take action to address the growing harm of fossil fuel disinformation the expansive relationship between PR and ad firms and fossil fuels will grow once more Individuals and companies in every part of the advertising ecosystem have a role to play There is a parallel with PR firms and ad agencies working for pesticide companies and promoting pesticide products Those agencies and professionals should be called on to make a similar commitment not to work for pesticide companies 6 Support independent investigative journalism Independent investigative journalism is crucial to a healthy democracy journalism that exposes corporate and government wrongdoing fraud lies deceit crimes and the multi faceted disinformation tactics these entities use to control the narrative about civic health and environmental issues Yet investigative journalism long considered democracy s fourth estate for its role in holding those in power to account is eroding Without a strong independent investigative media sector the public and elected officials are even more vulnerable to the covert communications tactics the pesticide industry uses to shape public opinion As the public relations industry booms and media institutions around the country are impacted by consolidation and a changing media landscape journalism has suffered Since 2008 employment in U S newsrooms plummeted 26 percent a 2021 Pew study found By 2018 there were

blares Letter from Prominent Doctors Implies Columbia Should Fire Dr Oz for Being a Quack The story by Ben Mathis Lilly is based on a letter by a group of doctors who want Columbia University to relieve Dr Oz of his position as vice chair of the department of surgery at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons Dr Oz has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence based medicine as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops states the letter which was sent soon after Dr Oz aired a show about glyphosate the herbicide associated with most genetically engineered crops that was recently designated as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization The complaint to Columbia was signed by Dr Henry I Miller and nine colleagues all of whom are distinguished physicians the letter claims So who are these prominent distinguished physicians Mathis Lilly didn t ask that question nor did reporters who covered the letter for the Associated Press Washington Post USA Today NPR Vox or New York Daily News If they had they would have learned that not all the physicians on the letter are so distinguished One was stripped of his medical license in New York and sent to federal prison camp for Medicaid fraud Yet Dr Gilbert Ross plays up his M D credentials in his role as acting president of the American Council for Science and Health ACSH Ross was joined on the Columbia letter by ACSH board member Dr Jack Fisher So what is ACSH Though some reporters treat it as an independent science source the group has been heavily funded by oil chemical and tobacco companies and has a long history of making inaccurate statements about science that directly benefit those industries for example claiming that secondhand smoke isn t linked to heart attacks fracking doesn t pollute water and there is no scientific consensus on global warming Two other signatories of the letter Miller and Dr Scott Atlas hail from the Hoover Institution a conservative think tank based at Stanford University that has a special affinity for featuring the work of climate change deniers In other words it s an institution whose commitment to science is highly questionable to nonexistent in one area and it s attacking Oz for pseudoscience pointed out Dr David Gorski in his blog about the Columbia letter Though an Oz critic himself Gorski dismissed the Columbia letter as unlikely to yield anything but a brief media blip and noted that Miller did a half assed job getting credible signers Gorski describes ACSH as a group that is pro

association may be why he tends to downplay it in the press for example AP reported the Columbia letter was led by Dr Henry Miller of Stanford University But Miller has landed in hot water before for tying himself too closely to Stanford In 2012 a TV ad imploring Californians to vote against GMO labeling was yanked off the air because it identified Miller as an M D at Stanford and had him perched in front of the ornately vaulted campus walkway Stanford demanded it be changed to reflect Miller s true status at Hoover Along with his colleagues at ACSH Miller has a long history of defending the indefensible for polluting and dangerous industries Nicotine is not particularly bad for you in the amounts delivered by cigarettes he wrote in 2012 He has repeatedly argued to bring back the banned pesticide DDT After the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster Miller wrote that people exposed to low levels of radiation could have actually benefitted from it Now he s fronting for the GMO industry Miller has become one of the most prolific and best known promoters of genetically engineered food and crops with frequent articles in Forbes Wall Street Journal and other outlets most recently Slate where he attacked Oz for his coverage of GMOs Among other industry talking points in the piece Miller claims that glyphosate has lower overall health impacts than white vinegar and fails to mention its recent listing by the World Health Organization as a carcinogen These facts are relevant in stories about scientific integrity The scientific accuracy and motivations of the accusers matter when they are publicly challenging the scientific accuracy and motivations of somebody they are trying to get fired We urge reporters and editors to take a closer look at the sources selling them story

the investigation and subsequent collapse of the Coca Cola front group Global Energy Balance Network the New York Times and Associated Press discovered that prominent university professors working on obesity issues had been funded by The Coca Cola Company This is not just a public health scandal It is a journalistic one as well Journalists have quoted two of these professors at least 30 times in news articles after the professors had received their Coca Cola funding but without mentioning that funding in their articles Many of the news outlets that published these articles are influential such as The New York Times Washington Post Los Angeles Times USA Today Boston Globe The Atlantic Monthly U S News and World Report Newsweek and National Public Radio It is a conflict of interest for professors working on obesity issues to accept funding from Coca Cola There is now substantial medical evidence that soda and the soda industry and especially Coca Cola and PepsiCo are in part responsible for our nation s obesity epidemic and increase the incidence of diabetes and heart disease If a professor takes money from one of these soda companies that is crucial context for their views on obesity and journalists disserve their readers by failing to report it Readers need to know who pays sources to evaluate the legitimacy and biases of these sources The net effect of quoting these professors without disclosing their Coca Cola funding is to unfairly enhance their credibility while undermining the credibility of public health and consumer advocates This short report reviews news coverage quoting two leaders of the Coca Cola front group Global Energy Balance Network Professors James O Hill and Steven N Blair James O Hill was president of the Global Energy Balance Network

after January 1 2011 for Hill and January 1 2009 for Blair in which journalists failed to disclose that Professors Hill and Blair were funded by Coca Cola Why did so many reporters and news outlets fail to disclose the conflicts of interest of these two prominent professors How can we prevent similar journalistic failures in the future One answer is clear reporters and editors must be on their guard for corporate funded professors who pose as issue experts but are really acting as mouthpieces for food companies like Coca Cola Readers too should be aware that some influential news outlets do not always disclose their sources conflicts of interest which makes their coverage of food and agriculture issues less fair and credible It gives readers a legitimate reason to be skeptical of some mainstream media coverage of food and agriculture issues because of pro industry biases sometimes contained in it In November we wrote a similar report about how journalists failed to disclose sources

communicate Dr Folta s lawsuit claimed he never received an unrestricted grant from Monsanto and that he never received any form of grant and never received support for him to travel around the country and defend genetically modified foods However documents show that Monsanto provided Dr Folta with in their words an unrestricted grant in the amount of 25 000 which may be used at your

Answers about pesticide industry funding to the University of Florida In October 2014 Dr Folta posted inaccurate information about his university s funding on the industry PR website GMO Answers When asked How much have the biotech companies donated to the Horticultural Sciences Department University of Florida Dr Folta responded There are zero donations At least during the last five years all I checked there are not even any grants or research agreements between the Horticultural Sciences Department at U F and any company selling biotech seeds Dr Folta then went on to claim During the last five years at the whole university there were a total of 21 000 in Monsanto grants to one faculty member in the panhandle who studies weeds That s it for the whole university Our records are all public so anyone could have found this information In fact companies selling biotech seeds donated more than 12 million to the University of Florida in fiscal year 2013 2014 alone according to University of Florida Foundation documents posted by NYT Monsanto was listed as a Gold donor that year meaning the company had donated at least 1 million Syngenta was a Diamond donor with Cumulative

charge of promoting UF s stance on GMOs Leaders at the University of Florida believe it is the university s role to educate the masses about GMOs and they share a stance with Monsanto according to an email obtained by U S Right to Know David Clark director of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Plant Innovation Program UF IFAS wrote to Monsanto executive Robb Fraley on July 21 2014 I thought your talk was excellent and very timely for our community and it is harmonious with the stance we are taking on GMOs at the University of Florida Clark also thanked Fraley for taking a few minutes to chat with me afterward about how we should be educating the 80 of the consumer population who know very little about the technology Clark noted that upon returning to campus he communicated with Drs Kevin Folta and Jack Payne about our discussion Kevin is our lead spokesperson at UF on the GMO topic and he has taken on the charge of doing just what we discussed educating the masses Jack is our Senior VP for IFAS and just last week he released a video showing just where UF IFAS stands on the GMO issue In the video Dr Payne claims there is no science that agrees with these folks that are afraid of GMOs In fact many scientists and studies have raised concerns about GMOs Clark told Fraley that both Folta and Payne are extremely passionate about this issue and together they are ramping up their efforts to spread the good word Partnered with front groups on industry funded spin events Dr Folta co hosted a June 2014 conference to promote GMOs and pesticides called the Biotech Literacy Project Boot Camp The event was billed as a partnership between University of Florida the Genetic Literacy Project and Academics Review two front groups that worked with Monsanto to promote pesticides and GMO seeds and attack industry critics The front groups told scientists and journalists inaccurately that the events were funded by a combination of government academia and industry In fact government and academic sources denied giving any funds and the only traceable money source is the biotech industry according to reporting by Paul Thacker in

inaccurate changes often and has at times contradicted itself Dr Folta also organized what he called a biotechnology literacy and communications day to promote GMOs at the University of Florida in 2015 Dr Folta described his plans in the proposal he sent to Monsanto seeking funding Speakers included UF professors Monsanto employee Vance Crowe representatives of industry aligned spin groups Center for Food Integrity and Biofortified and Tamar Haspel a food columnist for The Washington Post who has repeatedly misled readers about pesticides The example showcases how publicly funded

symptoms of pesticide poisoning there s probably nothing to worry about Your risk from any kind of especially pesticide exposure from consumption is probably somewhere between 10 000 and a million

background so as not to harm the credibility of the information Eric Sachs Monsanto The following is an excerpt from the Merchants of Poison report examining what the documents reveal about the many industry partners front groups trade groups PR and spin groups Monsanto and Bayer used to defend glyphosate from cancer concerns Cultivating Third Party Allies As pressure mounted in the European Union to ban glyphosate in the wake of the cancer report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC a new group called Freedom to Farm appeared at agricultural events across Europe Marketing itself as a grassroots effort led by farmers the group warned of a threat to farming posed by restrictions of cancer linked glyphosate But Freedom to Farm was not the grassroots uprising it purported to be Although Monsanto s name did not appear anywhere on Freedom to Farm materials the effort was fully staffed and supported by PR firms working for the company An intelligence report prepared for Monsanto by FleishmanHillard reveals the scope of the operation 39 5 full time equivalent staff from four PR firms were promoting Freedom to Farm in seven countries And that was not all In addition to the campaign team the report noted 56 trained operatives are supporting the on site recruiting process for grassroots FleishmanHillard one of the world s largest PR firms was also developing websites from supposedly grassroots farmer groups and working with researchers to develop papers that would portray glyphosate as an economic necessity and pitch the chemical as a climate solution Astroturfing and other tricks of the PR trade Freedom to Farm was a classic astroturf operation one that appears to be led by grassroots groups when it is actually an industry PR construct

bring about a win for our client Put your words in somebody else s mouth PR executive describes the third party strategy The PR machine behind Freedom to Farm is just one example of how companies use third party allies to push messaging that seems like it s coming from independent sources Internal Monsanto documents make clear that the company relied on a wide range of such third party allies to disseminate its messaging on glyphosate While many of these industry allies present themselves to the public as independent authorities on pesticides and GMOs the documents tie their messaging and in many cases their funding back to Monsanto The tactic of using third party allies dates back to the dawn of the public relations industry at the turn of the last century and Edward Bernays a nephew of Sigmund Freud Long considered the father of modern day public relations Bernays worked for various political and corporate interests to shift public opinion in ways that often left the public unaware they were being influenced or nudged at all In one of his earliest campaigns Bernays hired a team of doctors in 1913 to promote the benefits of bacon for breakfast Bernays did not disclose that the doctors he hired were paid by the pork industry As historian Alan Brandt noted about Bernays work the best public relations work left no fingerprints Put your words in somebody else s mouth is how Merryl Rose of the PR firm Porter Novelli sums up this third party strategy Monsanto s internal documents provide a rare window into how the company moved its product defense messaging through many mouths and name many of the third party allies the company relied on The reach and influence of these industry allies and the powerful false impression of independence they create cannot be overstated They are an industry unto themselves an entire sector of the economy devoted to efforts to convince the public and policy makers to accept Monsanto s spin and the pesticide industry more broadly PR

allies accelerated their output The timing was no coincidence and no mystery In spring 2013 a few months after California voters narrowly defeated a ballot initiative to label genetically engineered foods pesticide companies announced a new PR offensive to rehabilitate the image of its embattled GMO and pesticide products Monsanto selected PR firm FleishmanHillard to reshape its reputation amid fierce opposition to GMO foods according to the Holmes Report FleishmanHillard also became the PR agency of record for Bayer A trade group for the largest pesticide companies called the Council for Biotechnology Information hired Ketchum public relations company to lead the GMO Answers campaign a marketing and PR effort to promote GMOs and pesticides using the voices of academics FTI Consulting along with Red Flag and Lincoln Strategy Group are also identified in Monsanto documents and news reports as key players in Bayer and Monsanto s efforts to defend glyphosate from cancer concerns All these PR firms have histories of using covert tactics to defend polluting industries including working for tobacco and oil companies In the 1980s for example FleishmanHillard helped convert a tiny air ventilation company into the Healthy Buildings Institute a promotional group that received hundreds of thousands of dollars from tobacco industry lobbyists to spread the message that secondhand smoke was a symptom not a cause of indoor air pollution Washington Post reported FleishmanHillard also used espionage tactics against public health and tobacco control advocates sending industry spies to conferences and secretly tape recording sessions despite explicit instructions from conference organizers not to do so according to a study by Ruth Malone in the American Journal of Public Health Ketchum owned by the same parent company Omnicom as FleishmanHillard also did work for the tobacco industry and has a history of subterfuge The firm was once involved in an espionage operation conducted against environmental groups that opposed hazardous chemicals and GMOs according to leaked documents reported in 2008 by James Ridgeway in Mother Jones The documents establish that Beckett

Emails obtained by U S Right to Know revealed the maneuvering to set up Academics Review as a corporate front group promoting industry messaging from behind a mask of independence In emails from March 2010 Chassy discusses the concept for Academics Review with Jay Byrne Monsanto s former director of corporate communications Byrne compared the idea for Academics Review with the Center for Consumer Freedom a front group that Byrne said has cashed in on this to the extreme and I think we have a much better concept The Center for Consumer Freedom is directed by Rick Berman a lobbyist who has been called the king of corporate front groups for his work promoting the interests of tobacco and restaurant industries among many others The emails suggest Academics Review had a clear role to play for the industry s communication needs discrediting critics of GMOs and pesticides In one email Byrne told Chassy that he was developing an opportunities list with targets comprised of people and groups critical of agricultural biotechnology The targets Byrne noted would attract money from a range of well heeled corporations He offered that he and Val Giddings the former Vice President of the BIO trade group could serve as commercial vehicles to connect these entities corporations with the project in a manner which helps to ensure the credibility and independence and thus value of the primary contributors owners Monsanto s involvement with Academics Review is documented in these internal emails In an email later that year Chassy communicated with Monsanto s Eric Sachs about setting up a non profit to facilitate fundraising Sachs told Chassy that his colleagues at Monsanto could help motivate the industry trade organization to support the effort Sachs noted The key will be keeping Monsanto in the background so as not to harm the credibility of the information Chassy responded I think we are on the same page In February 2015 when Monsanto needed help defending glyphosate the company named Academics Review among the industry partners it planned to engage And Academics Review joined the chorus of messengers trying to downplay cancer concerns with a March 2015 post that gave the IARC report a failing grade of F In September 2015 the New York Times published a story about the ties between Chassy Academics Review and Monsanto As of this writing the Academics Review website

organization for its business backers is how consumer advocate Ralph Nader has described ACSH It has seized the language and style of the existing consumer organizations but its real purpose is to glove the hand that feeds it A leaked financial document provided to Mother Jones in 2013 provides a rare window into how this spin works The document describes ACSH s plans to pitch its services to corporations for specific product defense campaigns For example the document includes plans to ask food companies to fund a messaging campaign opposing GMO labeling to court e cigarette companies and to pitch a project to the Vinyl Institute which the document notes previously supported ACSH s chlorine and health report Among the group s funders in 2012 Bayer CropScience Syngenta Coca Cola Chevron and several leading tobacco companies Monsanto emails reveal that the company also tapped ACSH to help defend glyphosate In early 2015 Monsanto executive Daniel Goldstein emailed ACSH s Gil Ross with concerns that IARC would be assessing glyphosate at a time when both the EU and U S were reviewing reregistration of the chemical Ross replied enthusiastically noting that ACSH was already engaged in a full court press against IARC over the agency s cancer rulings on pesticides phthalates and diesel exhaust In an email to his Monsanto colleagues Goldstein championed ACSH writing While I would love

are constantly vilified by activist groups but heralded by ACSH Each and every day we work hard to prove our worth to companies such as Monsanto Later that same day Goldstein informed Ross that Monsanto would send the donation Great news Thanks Dan Ross responded He then asked for information about IARC and glyphosate In the wake of these email exchanges ACSH attacked the IARC report as Glyphosate Gate IARC s Scientific Fraud ACSH s president at the time Hank Campbell penned many more attacks on IARC and scientists who wrote critically about glyphosate and published them on his Science 2 0 website ACSH like Academics Review is one of several groups identified in Monsanto documents as a third party allies the company reached out to for its glyphosate defense needs These groups including Sense About Science the Science Media Centre and the Genetic Literacy Project all promoted common messaging about glyphosate and pesticides more generally downplaying or denying environmental and health concerns and arguing that glyphosate and other pesticide industry products do not need to be regulated In Tactic 4 we examine how these groups especially the Genetic Literacy Project played a key role in attacking the scientists who raised cancer concerns about glyphosate usrtk org monsanto attacks on scientists journalists Connections Between Third Party Allies Pro science spin groups that Monsanto tapped to defend glyphosate also have ties to each other To give just one example in 2011 the ACSH published a book by Jon Entine who went on to found the Genetic Literacy Project Entine s book about chemophobia the fear of chemicals mounts an ardent defense of atrazine a pesticide manufactured by Syngenta one of ACSH s funders at the time Internal documents

pushes the message that low levels of pesticide residues on food do not pose a health threat by pointing consumers to its safe produce calculator Consumers are invited to click on a type of food for example strawberries to learn that a woman could consume 453 servings of strawberries in one day without any effect even if the strawberries have the highest pesticide residue recorded for strawberries by USDA The analysis is based on a report funded by the Alliance for Food and Farming a trade association that represents large conventional grower groups that rely on pesticides Their

Professional organizations for dieticians beekeepers food technologists farmers and other groups that represent fields with obvious and sometimes not so obvious pesticide industry connections have also been tapped to amplify pesticide industry messaging including for glyphosate defense These groups sometimes receive funding from pesticide companies or include pesticide industry executives in positions of leadership on their boards or advisory councils Some professional groups spend enormous sums on direct marketing efforts to defend pesticides Commodity groups such as corn and soy growers associations spend tens of millions each year on programs to defend and expand chemical intensive corn and soy crops nearly all of which are genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate in the U S Just one of these groups appearing in Monsanto PR materials the National Corn Growers Association spent more than 108 million in five years See Appendix I To give a sense of state level spending in 2017

support is noted in the company s response plan for the IARC ruling In a section describing efforts to engage industry partners the plan states inoculate key grower associations These commodity groups responded to the IARC cancer report with press statements defending glyphosate and trying to preempt cancer concerns about other pesticides A June 2015 joint press release from the National Corn Growers Association and the American Soybean Association both named as third party allies in the Monsanto documents accused IARC of creating confusion and unnecessary fear amongst the public and using narrowly focused data removed from real world situations to find almost everything that it reviews as potentially carcinogenic They also warned that IARC might raise cancer concerns about other widely

according to internal emails from 2018 The emails revealed details of a sponsorship agreement between Bayer and the U S arm of the Foreign Press Association FPA The group guaranteed Bayer that selection of the honorary awardees for the Foreign Press Awards should not be contradictory to Bayer s strategic communications plans and initiatives and that Bayer would be made aware in advance about the honorees of the Foreign Press Awards The press association also promised Bayer that forums at an event for media professionals would be on topics relevant to Bayer s strategic communications goals and priority for example agriculture or any other issue that matter to Bayer and that Bayer could help identify media influencers from the American and international community of journalists to attend its two main cocktail parties each year In addition the press association offered to organize three background briefings with Bayer representatives and selected members of the international and national press and online bloggers to dive into topics that fit in Bayer s communications priorities and strategic goals While the FPA has since replaced the executive who wrote these emails and current leadership stands by the group s independence the emails indicate a culture of support for this kind of industry influence As the FPA s executive director shared with his Bayer contacts in 2018 I informed all Board Members of the FPA and the FPF Foreign Press Foundation about the dissatisfaction from Bayer that over the last couple of years the FPA didn t deliver as much as it was

of whom touted their affiliation with the prestigious scientific organization but failed to disclose their industry ties Nina Fedoroff Peter Raven and Phillip Sharp decried the public records investigation as science denialism and falsely compared it to Climate gate which involved illegal hacking of scientists emails This was the same false messaging Monsanto front groups were pushing Fedoroff was at that time working for OFW Law a lobbying firm whose clients included Syngenta and a pesticide industry trade group The Guardian later noted that conflict but failed to disclose those of her co authors Peter Raven was identified simply as Director Emeritus of the Missouri Botanical Garden That group counts Monsanto among its most generous benefactors and has a Monsanto Hall and a Monsanto Center with a Peter H Raven Library Phillip Sharp whom MIT Technology Review described as the man who helped launch biotech is the co founder of two multi billion dollar biotech companies Biogen and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals This was not the first time Fedoroff used her position with AAAS to aid Monsanto In 2012 while she was chair of the AAAS Board of Directors the Board issued a statement opposing GMO labeling just weeks before California voters went to the polls to decide on the issue The Board did not solicit input from the scientific society s 120 000 members and its

Rick Berke and Gideon Gil At a time when the public is questioning the legitimacy of news media and science itself it is important for health and science publications such as STAT to serve the public with as much truth and transparency as possible We write to ask you to step forward as leaders to address a serious problem in science coverage readers are being hoodwinked by corporations that are pushing policy agendas through PR writers who pretend to be independent but aren t On February 26 STAT failed its duty to the public to provide transparency when it published an opinion column by Henry Miller even though Miller had previously been caught publishing Monsanto ghostwritten work under his own name in Forbes After the New York Times revealed the Miller ghostwriting scandal in August 2017 Forbes dropped Miller as a columnist and deleted all his articles because he violated Forbes policy that requires opinion writers to disclose conflicts of interest and to publish only their own work a policy STAT should also adopt Update STAT has a conflict of interest disclosure policy here and informs us that Miller reported no conflicts Since the ghostwriting episode Miller s work has continued to raise serious red flags His recent column attacking the organic industry in Newsweek was sourced with information provided by a former Monsanto spokesman Jay Byrne whose relationship with Monsanto was not disclosed and Miller s column closely followed messaging that Byrne had worked out with Monsanto while collaborating to set up a front group of academics to attack industry critics according to emails uncovered by US Right to Know In his Newsweek article Miller also tried to discredit Danny Hakim the New York Times reporter who revealed Miller s Monsanto ghostwriting scandal without mentioning the scandal In addition to these recent failures to disclose his conflicts of interest Miller has a long documented history as a public relations and lobbying surrogate for corporations In a 1994 PR strategy memo to Phillip Morris APCO Associatesreferred to Miller as a key supporter in the global campaign to fight tobacco regulations In 1998 Miller pitched his PR services to corporations in a Work Plan Promoting Sound Science in Health Environmental and Biotechnology Policy A 2015 Monsanto PR plan to orchestrate outcry against the scientists of the World Health Organization s IARC cancer panel listed as its first external deliverable Engage Henry Miller Were corporate interests also behind Miller s opinion published this week by STAT that the

studies Praise for Miller s STAT article from the likes of Jeff Stier who works for the Koch affiliated Consumer Choice Center and Rhona Applebaum the former Coca Cola executive who orchestrated a front group to spin the science on obesity makes the article seem even more like some kind of corporate front group hit piece It wouldn t be the first time the pharmaceutical industry got away with using STAT to promote its political and sales agenda Last January STAT allowed two members of the corporate front group American Council on Science and Health ACSH to opine that the government should not be allowed to restrict doctors from prescribing OxyContin But the article did not disclose that ACSH has received funding from drug companies and pitches its services to corporations in quid pro quo agreements to defend their products and policy agendas In September STAT retracted an article published under the name of a doctor who praised pharmaceutical industry sales reps after Kevin Lomangino wrote in HealthNewsReview org that the doctor had received over 200 000 from drug companies An investigation then revealed that a PR firm had ghostwritten the doctor s article Big pharma s attempt to ghostwrite in STAT ended badly but not badly enough pointed out journalism professor Charles Seife in Slate STAT retracted the story but for the wrong reasons and without addressing the real problem It s time for STAT to address the problem and become part of the solution in bringing truth and transparency to science reporting The public has a right to know when corporations ghostwrite or have their fingerprints all over the opinions of academics who claim to be independent Just as medical journals started tightening rules about conflicts of interest forcing more disclosure of the hidden motives behind certain research articles media outlets have to have a reckoning as well Seife wrote in Slate They must learn to stop amplifying the messages of front groups and winking at practices like ghostwriting in their editorial pages In short the media must realize that every time they repeat a sock puppet s message it directly undermines the outlet s credibility For the credibility of STAT and for the trust of its readers we urge you to implement a clear and strong policy to require all your writers to provide full disclosure about conflicts of interest

UC Davis See our 2016 letter to the World Food Center inquiring about funding for Entine and IFAL and their obscure explanation about where their funding comes from Cooking up a Chipotle boycott Emails indicate that Dr Ronald and Jon Entine collaborated on messaging to discredit critics of genetically engineered foods In one case Dr Ronald proposed to organize a boycott against the Chipotle restaurant chain over its decision to offer and promote non GMO foods In April 2015 Dr Ronald emailed Entine and Alison Van Eenennaam PhD a former Monsanto employee and cooperative extension specialist at UC Davis to suggest they find a student to write about farmers using more toxic pesticides to grow non GMO corn I suggest we publicize this fact once we get the details and then organize a chipotle boycott Dr Ronald wrote Entine directed an associate to write an article for Genetic Literacy Project on the theme that pesticide use often soars when farmers switch to a non GMO model to supply restaurants like Chipotle The article co authored by Entine and touting his UC Davis affiliation fails to substantiate that claim with data Co founded biotech spin group BioFortified Played

PhD and Anna Lappé based on revelations from internal corporate and government documents that detail how Monsanto now owned by Bayer ran its product defense campaigns to protect glyphosate and the GMO seeds designed to tolerate the chemical Weaponizing the web When Edward Bernays designed PR campaigns for his clients in the 1920s and the decades that followed he didn t have the tools that help today s corporate clients reach millions even billions with a stroke of a few keys the internet and social media Today as more people get their news and information from social media blogs and seemingly independent online news and information sites like WebMD companies like Monsanto now Bayer have developed many new stealth tactics to shape online public discourse Monsanto has been honing its skills in this arena for decades In 2002 Jay Byrne Monsanto s then director of internet outreach helped influence online debates about genetically engineered foods with the help of fake citizens people who did not actually exist who were bombarding internet listservs with messages denouncing the scientists and environmentalists who were critical of GM crops according to reporting by George Monbiot in the Guardian 2 In a pitch to industry groups the Guardian reported Byrne described how before he got to work the top GM sites listed by an internet search engine were all critical of the technology Following his intervention the top sites were all supportive ones and several of those sites had been established by Bivings a Monsanto PR firm 3 4 As we have shown throughout the Merchants of Poison report Monsanto worked with a wide range of third party allies to spread its product defense messaging using stealth tactics that make it difficult and at times impossible to detect the company s fingerprints That is especially true online where search engines serve up corporate messaging from independent appearing sources and messengers appear seemingly spontaneously across social media platforms to attack journalists scientists and others who pose a threat to the company or the pesticide industry more broadly Internal Monsanto documents point to an inner circle of messengers

industry messaging One of the strategies Genetic Literacy Project uses to get consistent high ranking results is to republish content of mainstream news articles The website pulls articles from a range of outlets ensuring a continual fresh stream of content Importantly GLP changes headlines condenses content adds graphics and emphasizes specific keywords such as glyphosate in headlines The website also sometimes adds promotional content to emphasize product defense messaging while linking back to the original news outlet These practices elevate the site s Search Engine Optimization SEO 17 helping vault Genetic Literacy Project s industry friendly messages to the top of the Google News search As an example in Google News searches for glyphosate and cancer conducted 11 days apart on February 14 and February 25 2020 six of the top 10 returns on both dates were from Genetic Literacy Project or the ACSH connected Science 2 0 Several of these were reposts of articles lifted from other news outlets and reprinted by Genetic Literacy Project in condensed form Reposts included articles from the Wall Street Journal Reuters Bloomberg Law and USA Today posted with new headlines and some of the text cut to emphasize or downplay particular themes For instance a 33 paragraph Bloomberg Law article by Stephen Gardner titled Four Pesticides Could Show U K s Post Brexit Regulation

carrying the reporter s byline The reprint does not include for example a paragraph explaining worries over the safety of glyphosate and a pending ban in Luxembourg 19 Genetic Literacy Projects

further notes that GLP selects short segments from an article chosen to reflect the original piece changes titles so as not to pose a conflict in searches and also adds pictures or illustrations All this provides opportunities to emphasize product defense messaging while keeping a stream of fresh content on the GLP website and helping its SEO Genetic Literacy Project also makes frequent use of

federal laws should not preempt California laws requiring warnings on cancer causing chemicals 21 GLP reprinted the press release under the byline of then California Attorney General Xavier Becerra but added an Editor s note in bold near the top Most experts including EPA regulators don t share California s view that glyphosate causes cancer 22 As another example of how the Genetic Literacy Project alters content to emphasize particular messaging consider the excerpt from a January 28 2020 BBC article by Emma Woollacot about a new weed zapping device that uses electricity rather than chemicals 25 The reprint leads with a paragraph that appears later in the piece 26 The actual opening to Woollacot s article was not as helpful to pesticide industry messaging Woollacot began by

close tabs on the public communications and personal information of scientists journalists and other influencers who are critical of pesticide industry products PR firm balances online conversation One of the strategies the world s largest pesticide companies developed to influence online conversations is GMO Answers Though the effort was clearly a marketing and PR campaign launched in 2013 by the PR firm Ketchum 31 the GMO Answers website described itself as a transparency initiative 32 The initiative centers around a website that looks like a definitive source of information and features the voices of experts enlisted to build public trust in GMOs and the pesticides used to grow them These experts however have been handpicked by Ketchum the industry funded PR firm running the site Tax records show that the Council for Biotechnology Information a trade group funded by Bayer Syngenta BASF DowDupont and formerly Monsanto paid Ketchum over 14 million between 2014 and 2018 to conduct GMO Answers 33 CropLife International the pesticide industry trade association has since taken over the funding 34 Ketchum characterized GMO Answers as an effort to answer public concerns with nothing filtered or censored and no voice silenced As the St Louis Post Dispatch reported at the time the top pesticide companies launched the campaign to help clear up confusion and dispel mistrust about their products 35 The website discloses that it is funded by pesticide firms but how filtered is the site s content Internal documents reveal what a heavy hand the industry has had in shaping content

the IARC cancer ruling for example Monsanto named GMO Answers as an industry partner that could help discredit the cancer agency s finding GMO Answers also appears as a key partner in Monsanto s PR plan to discredit the U S Right to Know public records investigation into hidden industry ties of academics 36 And emails obtained by U S Right to Know via the public records search found a number of the independent experts and groups listed on the GMO Answers website were receiving funds from Monsanto or were working with the company on PR projects in ways that were not publicly disclosed 37 38 These internal records also reveal at least three instances of Ketchum employees working with professors to ghostwrite content for GMO Answers 39 Messaging on the site also mirrors industry talking points often with industry sources On the GMO Answers website typing in the question Does glyphosate cause cancer yields an answer from Bayer scientist David Saltmiras No glyphosate does not cause cancer But don t just take my word for it Please also consider statements from multiple authorities who reviewed both robust glyphosate data sets and peer reviewed literature 40 See Tactic 1 for what the documents reveal about how Monsanto influenced regulatory reviews with subpar and ghostwritten science Queries to GMO Answers about the IARC cancer report on glyphosate elicit an infographic from Monsanto s Cami Ryan who now works for Bayer comparing the toxicity of glyphosate to wine 41 and a quote from Kevin Folta the University of Florida professor who worked with Monsanto on PR projects discussed in Tactic 2 claiming Glyphosate is amazingly non toxic to humans or any other animals 42 Folta now also works for the Bayer funded Genetic Literacy Project 43 Alongside the website Ketchum developed a social media plan to engage people on platforms that were discussing GMOs and bring visitors to the site Ketchum boasted this work had a measurable impact on the conversation about GMOs

efforts on behalf of the pesticide industry earned Ketchum recognition for its success spinning the media and online coverage of the industry s products GMO Answers was shortlisted in the Public Relations Crisis and Issue Management category for a CLIO Award a prominent international advertising award 45 Unleashing the trolls Coordinated aggressive pushback on social media is a common experience for people who disagree with pesticide industry narratives about pesticides and GMOs In Tactic 4 we discussed how attacking critics often with ad hominem personal attacks is a common product defense strategy one that is increasingly playing out on social media and in other online spaces In one example from the summer of 2017 Marion Nestle a professor of nutrition at New York University became a target when she posted a blog critical of a documentary called Food Evolution 46 The pro GMO film was funded by an industry trade group and heavily promoted by industry allies including professors trade groups and front groups described in this report On her blog Nestle characterized the documentary as a GMO propaganda film She explained to her readers on June 21 2017 I have asked repeatedly to have my short interview clip removed from this film The director refuses He believes his film is fair and balanced I do not Cue a coordinated troll attack Would you believe 870 comments These were filed in response to my post of last week about the GMO propaganda film Nestle reported on June 26 47 In a post titled A Win for GMO Trolls Nestle announced she is no longer accepting comments on her website The GMO trolls people who post deliberately hostile comments have defeated me she wrote This is not about thoughtful discussion of the scientific social and political

unintelligible gibberish declared the Competitive Enterprise Institute 50 while David Ropeik a risk management consultant with pesticide industry clients tried to discredit Taleb s paper as anti GMO advocacy via Twitter and a lengthy article on Medium 51 52 Genetic Literacy Project wondered whether Taleb is a dangerous imbecile in the pay of the anti GMO mafia 53 A familiar ring of industry friendly writers including the freelance reporter Keith Kloor 54 and Mark Lynas of Cornell Alliance for Science 55 jumped in on Twitter to promote these critiques unlike the mafia with tentacles

age of social media and online news the core strategy to track attack and try to discredit critics of chemical intensive industrial agriculture has been developed over decades Consider Jay Byrne Monsanto s former director of communications who ensured back in 2001 that the top websites appearing in an internet search for GMO foods were all supportive ones 56 Today as president of the public relations firm v Fluence Byrne plays an active role in pesticide industry defense efforts via his Bonus Eventus 57 The private social networking portal supplies academics and other industry allies

close ties to Monsanto 59 The emails were obtained by U S Right to Know via a public records request In a newsletter from November 2016 Byrne urged Phillips and other recipients to share content on key topics important to the pesticide industry and these influencers in turn shared messages via Twitter and other social media channels on topics Byrne suggests That week Byrne urged followers to discuss the flaws and omissions in a New York Times report about the failure of GMO crops to increase yields and reduce pesticides 60 and the mounting questions facing the IARC scientists who reported glyphosate is probably a human carcinogen Byrne prompted his audience to share content on these themes from industry connected writers Julie Kelly 61 Dr Henry I Miller 62 Kavin Senapathy 63 and Hank Campbell 64 formerly of the American Council on Science and Health one of the groups Monsanto was paying to help discredit the cancer scientists 65 All these writers though they appear to be independent are linked to Monsanto and participate in the echo chamber that shares pesticide industry messaging via blogs and social media activities Byrne s client list has included a range of agribusiness and pharmaceutical companies and business groups including the American Chemistry Council Syngenta AstraZeneca Monsanto Pfizer the American Farm Bureau National Corn Growers Association Grocery Manufacturers Association the pesticide industry trade group CropLife and the International Rice Research Institute IRRI which promotes genetically engineered Golden Rice 66 His pitch to

point to a number of individuals and organizations including Byrne the Genetic Literacy Project and the American Council on Science and Health as key players in the effort to paint GMOs and glyphosate products as science based solutions while attacking industry critics using product defense efforts paralleling those by the tobacco and fossil fuel industries While many of these efforts play out on social media or other online spaces they are ultimately about lobbying in the real world they are part of a coordinated effort to keep toxic products unregulated even as health environmental and safety concerns mount As Harvard professors Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway recount in their seminal book Merchants of Doubt the product defense efforts of fossil fuel and tobacco corporations succeeded in shaping public opinion and policy for decades efforts that can be traced back to a handful of scientists who obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to climate change 70 As Oreskes said in the documentary Merchants of Doubt None of this is about the science All of this is a political debate about the role of government 71 None of this is about the science All of this is a political debate about the role of government Harvard Professor Naomi Oreskes As we have shown throughout this report policy debates over glyphosate GMOs and the broader topic of chemical intensive industrial agriculture have been heavily influenced by a small group of actors too led by academics and front groups with ties to industry The U S government has also been an ally to these efforts keeping products unregulated and helping to spread corporate messaging As one example a December 2013 email reveals communications between Genetic Literacy Project s Jon Entine and Max T Holtzman then acting deputy undersecretary at USDA Entine shared a pitch for a series of US government GLP Byrne projects to influence journalists noting that he and Jay Byrne Monsanto s former communications director had spoken to two dozen people at State with reps from USDA FAS and USAID on how to effectively engage NGOs and journalists on agricultural biotech and to preview Byrne s stakeholder database tool 72 Entine proposed collaborating on a series of projects to increase global acceptance of GMOs and pesticides The projects he described include many of the stealth tactics named in this report He

outline below provides natural intersection points where usda USG U S government messaging and your efforts intersect well I d like to engage further and loop other folks here at usda not only from the technical trade areas but from our communications shop as well 73 Further details of this partnership are not public but the Monsanto investigations reveal numerous examples of the U S government aiding pesticide industry PR efforts As one example in 2012 U S taxpayers paid to produce a series of videos to promote genetically engineered foods with corporate messaging Byrne s PR firm v Fluence helped create the videos that were designed to appear a little low budget and amateurish according to an email from University of Illinois Professor Bruce Chassy obtained by U S Right to Know 74 Chassy wrote to Monsanto employees on April 27 2012 to inform them he had a small grant from the U S State Department to produce 10 YouTube videos noting that he thought it was important the videos came from the University of Illinois with credit to the State Department He also noted he was seeking more government funding as well as outside sources to produce more videos and he invited the Monsanto employees to provide suggestions Monsanto s Eric Sachs responded in a completely parallel effort Monsanto is shooting videos to reinforce the safety of GM foods in support of food retail industry requests for Monsanto to defend the onslaught of attacks on biotech crop safety and Bt RR Bt and Roundup Ready sweet corn in particular I alerted this team of your project and everyone was eager to see your work on line Obviously independent content from the U of I and supported by US Govt agencies is the preferred approach 75 The example is just one of many as we have shown throughout this report indicating that Monsanto s public relations efforts to defend its flagship glyphosated based Roundup herbicides and Roundup Ready seed products depend on subterfuge on convincing the public that corporate product defense messaging is coming from independent sources that are in reality anything but Conclusion In recent years outrage over Big Oil s decades long campaign of doubt and

on convincing the public that corporate product defense messaging is coming from independent sources that are in reality anything but Conclusion In recent years outrage over Big Oil s decades long campaign of doubt and denialism to stall climate action has spilled onto the front page of major newspapers and into the Halls of Congress 76 Outrage around Big Tobacco s long standing attempts to delay action on tobacco regulation and the industry s continued marketing and misinformation has fueled similar public outcry With more than 480 000 people dying for tobacco related reasons 77 and 5 million extra deaths related to climate change every year 78 this misinformation is literally deadly In this report through a case study about one pesticide company and one spin campaign to protect one chemical we hope to add to the growing literature building the case for vigilance about industry misinformation including from the pesticide industry Thanks to discovery and the findings from public records investigations we now have a clear record of the disinformation campaigns waged by Monsanto Bayer and with these tactics revealed we see clearly one more case of a pesticide marketed as safe Companies like Monsanto now Bayer didn t just take a page from the PR playbook of Big Oil and Big Tobacco they helped to write it Ultimately the story of deceit this report documents is a story about industry vulnerability To forgo the regulation that would impact their profitability and market share companies in the pesticide oil and tobacco industry are profoundly reliant on the success of PR subterfuge They must protect the secrecy about how the evidence on which they base their defense is influenced by their cooptation of scientific and academic institutions and they need to cover up the large web of organizations from non profits to academic think tanks and fake grassroots groups that they rely on to push their products around the world In the case of the pesticide industry their current business model would not be possible if pesticide products were subject to rigorous independent research and if there were widespread public understanding of the harms and risks of many of these products Dissipating the industry fog of doubt denial and deflection we can more clearly see that glyphosate as well as many of the most widely used pesticides in the world are indeed harmful to people and planet And not only is it possible to feed the world without glyphosate and other toxic pesticides but given increasing weed and pest resistance to these pesticides and their impact on the

are well documented and their grave impacts well understood the pesticide industry s similar role in widespread disinformation and its extensive scope and impact has not been as well documented or publicly understood We hope this report and the chorus of recent reporting will change that and give journalists policy makers public interest groups and consumers the tools they need to correct the

Merchants of Poison How Monsanto Sold the World on a Toxic Pesticide by Stacy Malkan with Kendra Klein PhD and Anna Lappé you can read the full report here The analysis draws from thousands of pages of internal corporate documents that reveal many details in their own words about how pesticide companies deny science and run their propaganda operations Here we explain why we wrote the report what the current science reveals about the health risks of glyphosate and what s at stake for our health and the planet Pesticide firms helped write the disinformation playbook On the morning of April 14 1994 the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment swore in seven tobacco executives for a hearing on the regulation of tobacco products The video from that day 1 with executive after executive stating a version of I don t believe that nicotine or our products are addictive is seared into the collective memory of Big Tobacco s lies and deception Indeed for decades before that testimony tobacco executives had known that cigarettes cause cancer and that nicotine is in fact addictive Jessica Persson Agence France Presse Tobacco industry executives testify before Congress In October 2019 at a House oversight subcommittee hearing on civil rights Martin Hoffert a former consultant for Exxon testified that in the early 1980s scientists working for the company were already predicting how fossil fuel use would increase carbon dioxide levels leading to rising temperatures 2 Internal documents would show that as far back as 1968 the American Petroleum Institute an oil industry trade group had identified the threat of global warming and the role of the companies in their sector in it 3 Oil industry executives knew fossil fuel use would cause global warming and yet not only hid the science but actively attacked those who raised alarm Tobacco executives knew and covered up the health risks of their products 4 These industries used now well documented disinformation tactics to push doubt and denialism 5 Big Tobacco s spin tactics arguably cost millions of lives as regulations emerged long after it was evident that cigarettes cause cancer and continue to cost lives The WHO estimates 8 million people die annually from tobacco use 6 The fossil fuel sector s spin pushed science denialism and political inaction that has led to a warming

regulators even manipulating the very science on which policy is made to distract from the evidence that pesticide intensive agriculture threatens ecosystems and human health In this report we show how pesticide companies not only followed in the footsteps of Big Oil and Big Tobacco they helped to write the public relations playbook that obscures the dangers of widely used consumer products that science shows are threatening human and environmental health around the globe This report about Monsanto s campaign to defend glyphosate tells one piece of a broader story that for decades pesticide companies have waged expensive PR campaigns to shape the narrative about science and our food system pushing the twin ideas that pesticides a term that encompasses insecticides herbicides fungicides and more are safe and that we need them to feed the world In recent years groundbreaking global studies have shown the grave threat agricultural chemicals pose to biodiversity and public health and how they fail to deliver on their promises for greater agricultural productivity leading to crop loss and weed and pest resistance 8 Yet despite the mounting evidence the pesticide industry has doubled down on deceptive messaging This report comes at a time of ever greater industry consolidation in the agrichemical and seed sector much like we ve seen across the economy By 2020 thanks to recent purchases including the Bayer Monsanto deal just four companies controlled 62 percent of the global market for agrichemicals and 51 percent of the global market for commercial seeds according to ETC Group Bayer s market share of agrichemicals 16 percent was second only to ChemChina Syngenta at 25 percent followed by BASF with 11 percent of the market and Corteva the rebranded name of the merged Dow and Dupont company with 10 percent For commercial seeds and seed traits Bayer controls 23 percent of the market while Corteva has a 17 percent market share with ChemChina at 7 percent and BASF at 4 percent 9 To bring light to the pesticide industry s PR spin this report provides a deep dive into one company and one PR campaign Monsanto bought in 2018 by German pharmaceutical and

Kari Hamerschlag along with Stacy Malkan and Anna Lappé which documents some of the messages and tactics of food industry front groups including the millions of dollars they spend every year to shape the story of our food system 10 Pesticide companies wage expensive PR campaigns to shape the narrative about science and our food system pushing the twin ideas that pesticides are safe and that we need them to feed the world Two major developments in recent years prompted further reporting on this topic First new scientific evidence discussed below makes clear the urgency of addressing the health and environmental impacts associated with the pesticide industry s products including glyphosate herbicide formulations Second access to new evidence from internal corporate documents obtained over the past five years via legal actions and public interest investigations provides new insight into how Monsanto ran its propaganda operations with the help of the pesticide and processed food industries Thanks to tens of thousands of pages of internal corporate documents made available by these efforts the public has unprecedented access to how the industry develops strategies to mislead the public These documents include the Monsanto Papers obtained from litigation over glyphosate based herbicides and public records made available through an investigation led by colleagues at U S Right to Know Many of these documents are available on the U S Right to Know website and via documents we donated to the UCSF chemical and food industry documents archives 11 This report adds to a

apocalypse and detailing of the tactics industry used to keep the deadly pesticide paraquat on the market for decades or The New Yorker s reporting on pesticide company Syngenta s attacks on the

through seemingly independent voices using many of the same strategies and funding streams and sometimes the very same people the tobacco and fossil fuel industries use to mislead the public Why focus on the PR spin around glyphosate There are certainly more acutely toxic pesticides in agricultural use There s paraquat where exposure to even a capful can be deadly and the class of insecticides known as neonicotinoids which have increased the toxicity of U S agriculture for insects by 48 fold in the past 25 years 12 But while not the most toxic glyphosate is still toxic to humans and devastating to ecosystems we discuss in Part 1 the science linking glyphosate to cancer reproductive harm kidney disease monarch butterfly declines and other health and environmental impacts And as the most widespread agricultural chemical in the world a detailing of how long the company knew about this toxicity how much it did to spin a different story and how it continues to push doubt science denial and deflection as it faces thousands of lawsuits from farmers and gardeners suffering from cancers related to glyphosate use is critically important Furthermore the internal documents paint a clear picture of the PR tactics Monsanto Bayer used and the players the company relies on providing insight into product defense strategies not used just for glyphosate but across all classes of

engineered crops or GMOs first commercialized in the mid 1990s The connection is simple most GMO crops sold to date have been developed with traits to express an insecticide or tolerate an herbicide or do both and nearly all have been engineered with the trait of glyphosate tolerance 13 So the debates about the risks and rewards of GMOs are intimately linked to the story of the spin around glyphosate safety Most GMO crops on the market have been engineered to tolerate glyphosate Based on these thousands of pages of internal Monsanto documents and investigative reporting analyzed together in one place for the first time this report reveals five pesticide industry disinformation tactics chronicling how Monsanto 1 Corrupted the science We show how Monsanto employees shaped the science on glyphosate including paying academics ghostwriting papers influencing regulatory agencies and using other covert tactics to shape the scientific and regulatory record 2 Co opted academia We report how Monsanto and other pesticide companies partnered with and paid universities and professors who in turn promoted and defended glyphosate and the GMO seeds designed to tolerate the herbicide Many of these partnerships were not transparent to the public 3 Mobilized third party allies We describe the large and well funded third party echo chamber the front groups professional organizations universities astroturf campaigns and others who disseminated messaging crafted by Monsanto and its PR firms for the purpose of opposing health safety and transparency regulations for pesticide industry products 4 Tracked and attacked scientists journalists and influencers We examine how industry front groups that claim to be pro science including the Genetic Literacy Project and American Council on Science and Health targeted the World Health Organization s cancer researchers and other scientists and journalists who reported on glyphosate s links to cancer 5 Dominated online spaces We discuss how Monsanto and other companies deployed the same front groups that attacked scientists and journalists in defense of glyphosate to infiltrate online spaces and garner top placement in Google News searches to elevate industry messaging This report also documents how the sector s influence campaigns are themselves big business Together six of the trade associations named in Monsanto documents for glyphosate defense the Biotechnology Innovation Organization CropLife America American Chemistry Council the Grocery Manufacturers Association the National Corn Grower s Association and

Climate and Biodiversity The Rise of Glyphosate Glyphosate is now the most widely used agricultural chemical in the world it is registered in 130 countries approved for use on over 100 crops and marketed as 750 different types of products 18 Traces of the chemical are found in many everyday foods from cereal and hummus to honey and wine 19 20 Glyphosate is now so ubiquitous in the environment it is even found in rain contaminating 86 percent of samples gathered from across the United States 21 And it s ubiquitous in our bodies too A June 2022 Centers for Disease Control study found the chemical in the urine of more than 80 of the children and adults they tested 22 Never before have we sprayed so much of a chemical on our food on our yards and even on our children s playgrounds But it wasn t always so widely used In 1970 a Monsanto chemist discovered that glyphosate formerly used as a descaling agent could be an effective herbicide The company patented its use as a weedkiller that year and first marketed it under the trade name Roundup in 1974 For two decades it was used less frequently than other herbicides such as 2 4 D dicamba and atrazine But as Carey Gillam details in

capacity to genetically engineer crops scientists at Monsanto discovered organisms in the sludge filled waste ponds surrounding its Roundup production plant in Louisiana that could confer resistance to glyphosate 23 The company successfully inserted genetic material from those bacteria into soybeans and found that the crop could withstand being sprayed with Roundup and continue to grow The company saw huge potential Historically farmers would have to take care not to spray herbicides on their crops as it would kill them but these new genetically engineered Roundup Ready crops allowed farmers to spray glyphosate directly on their fields throughout the growing season killing weeds without damaging their crops In the U S no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use Charles Benbrook Environmental Sciences Europe In 1996 Monsanto released GMO Roundup Ready soybeans followed in 1998 by Roundup Ready corn these are two of the most widely planted crops in the U S representing over 180 million acres of production in 2021 24 Engineering these crops to go hand in hand with glyphosate was a major market coup for Monsanto Largely as a result of Roundup Ready corn and soy use of glyphosate in the U S spiked 3 100 percent between 1990 and 2014 25 by which point 94 percent of soybeans and 92 percent of corn acreage in the U S were Roundup Ready 26 By the 2000s Monsanto was making billions in revenue on glyphosate and the GMO seeds that go with it 27 In 2018 German agrichemical giant Bayer AG purchased the company for 63 billion evaluating it as a solid investment 28 presumably based on current and projected profits from the lucrative herbicide and GMO seed segment of the company s operations But by that year there had already been evidence emerging about the safety of glyphosate evidence Bayer chose to ignore and continues to deny 29 Mounting concern about the safety of glyphosate would soon cost the company billions of dollars In this

Environmental Protection Agency flagged flagged glyphosate as having the potential to cause cancer 30 But Monsanto s spin tactics many of which are detailed in this report have long suppressed these concerns and maintained a widely held public narrative that the herbicide is benign 31 The company even ran ads claiming glyphosate was safer than table salt 32 However in March 2015 thirty years after the EPA first raised cancer concerns about glyphosate the herbicide was publicly classified as a probable human carcinogen 33 The finding came from the world s premiere independent cancer research agency the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC The agency is tasked with identifying cancer hazards and its classifications have global implications influencing public policy regulatory decisions public health recommendations and litigation 34 IARC found strong evidence of genotoxicity damage to genetic information within a cell causing mutations which may lead to cancer and a statistically significant association between non Hodgkin lymphoma and exposure to glyphosate 35 The Roundup Trials In the years following the IARC classification more than 125 000 people have sued Monsanto over claims that Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma a cancer that affects the immune system Plaintiffs include farmers school and park groundskeepers and homeowners who used products like Roundup on their lawns and gardens The first trial Dewayne Johnson v Monsanto Company concluded in August 2018 36 School groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson developed non Hodgkin lymphoma after routinely using glyphosate based herbicides at his job Johnson reports that despite wearing protective gear he was soaked in the herbicide after a hose broke on his equipment He later developed rashes lesions and was soon diagnosed with cancer 37 A jury awarded Johnson 289 million reduced to 78 million by the judge which included compensation for damages along with punitive damages based on the finding that Monsanto failed to warn consumers of its products potential dangers The next two trials were brought by homeowners who frequently used Roundup on their properties first Edward Hardeman and then a married couple Alberta and Alva Pilliod In both cases juries unanimously found that Roundup

has linked the chemical to high rates of kidney disease in farming communities and to shortened pregnancy and low birth weight in a cohort of women in the Midwest 39 40 Animal studies and bioassays have linked glyphosate and its formulations to endocrine disruption decreased sperm function and disruption of the gut microbiome 41 42 43 44 45 One animal study found a link with increased risk of fatty liver disease even at ultra low doses of glyphosate 46 Research also shows that glyphosate is genotoxic causing DNA damage in human cells that can lead to cancer 47 What s more research shows that when glyphosate is combined with other chemicals in commercial formulations such as Roundup the end product may be much more harmful than glyphosate alone 48 While research has raised important health concerns about ingredients such as surfactants that help glyphosate penetrate the surface of plants regulators have failed to address the safety of these ingredients or how they may interact with glyphosate to harm human health 49 See our fact sheet for more on the science behind health concerns In the environment glyphosate can kill or harm 93 percent of the plants and animals protected under the Endangered Species Act according to the EPA 50 Researchers have identified glyphosate use as a primary driver of the decimation of monarch butterfly populations because the ubiquity of

is extracted and refined into elemental phosphorus This mining involves stripping the soil off mountaintops which destroys vegetation contaminates water creates noise and air pollution and destroys acres of habitat for critical species 58 Processing the ore into glyphosate raises further concerns A plant in Soda Springs Idaho formerly owned by Monsanto and now owned by Bayer is the only site in North America that can refine phosphate ore into elemental phosphate The plant has been designated as a Superfund site and has resulted in decades long contamination of groundwater and contributes to surface water pollution that violates Idaho water quality standards in several nearby streams and creeks 59 60 An overwhelming body of science shows that from sourcing to processing to end product glyphosate imperils the health of ecosystems and people The spin and its consequences As illustrated in the section that follows the story of glyphosate is one of spin and deflection by Monsanto and

how the company co opted academic institutions and paid academics to promote and defend its products and lobby for deregulation We document how the company deployed a wide range of third party allies many of whom falsely claimed to be independent of industry to defend its products attack the scientists who raised cancer concerns about glyphosate and dominate online spaces including Google news searches with pesticide industry messaging These tactics have had very real consequences Despite evidence of harm the federal government turned a blind eye when it came to monitoring glyphosate failing to test for it on food until 2016 and in our bodies until 2022 despite doing so for other commonly used pesticides for decades And rather than restricting the use of glyphosate the EPA has raised the legal threshold for residues on some foods up to 300 fold since the 1990s 61 Glyphosate now finds its way into our food supply at alarming levels not only because it is used so widely on

that the percentage of the U S population with detectable levels of glyphosate in their bodies increased from 12 percent in the early 1990s to 70 percent by 2014 62 A 2020 study suggests even more widespread exposure finding glyphosate in all study participants 63 What s more Roundup Ready genetically engineered crops have accelerated a destructive pesticide treadmill Superweeds that no longer respond to glyphosate now plague more than 60 million acres of U S farmland 64 As the efficacy of glyphosate has waned over the past decade the use of herbicides across the American Midwest has doubled as farmers attempt to deal with herbicide resistant weeds 65 In fact despite using significantly more pesticides than they did more than half a century ago farmers are actually losing more of their crops to pests including weeds insects and fungi The pesticide industry is doubling down on this failing but lucrative approach with the latest genetically engineered crops designed to tolerate

spin tactics we describe in Merchants of Poison Part 2 The Spin In Merchants of Poison we illuminate five of the core spin tactics industry uses to influence regulation policy and attitudes about pesticides and the future of food systemsby diving deep into how Monsanto now Bayer ran its disinformation campaigns around the herbicide glyphosate We note how the use of these covert messaging and product defense tactics has escalated in the past several years as Monsanto and now Bayer faced a cascade of crises after a prestigious international science panel the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC ruled in 2015 that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen In Tactic 1 we detail how the company worked to shape the scientific record on glyphosate and their influence over regulatory reviews and oversight We then describe in Tactic 2 how the company and its allies in the pesticide industry mobilized public universities and professors several of whom were receiving undisclosed payments to promote and defend glyphosate and the patented seeds that were genetically modified to tolerate the chemical In Tactic 3 we examine some of the third party allies including front groups trade groups and public relations firms Monsanto deployed to disseminate its product defense messaging In Tactic 4 we share another key product defense strategy attacking and attempting to silence and marginalize scientists and journalists who raise public health concerns Finally in Tactic 5 we look at strategies Monsanto Bayer and the pesticide industry more broadly has used to move their messaging online dominate Google News search results and create the false impression of consensus about the necessity and safety of pesticides and specifically glyphosate A core

a nonprofit public relations agency partially funded by corporations and industry groups whose products the group often defends Current and past funders include BASF Bayer DuPont Monsanto Coca Cola Nestle and food chemical and nuclear industry trade organizations as well as media groups government agencies foundations and universities The SMC PR model is spreading around the world Nature reported in 2013 The group launched in 2002 in the UK in response to media frenzies over vaccines GMO crops and animal research to shape news coverage to better represent mainstream science according to its fact sheet Groups with the same charter now operate in Canada Australia New Zealand Germany and Japan and are being planned in Brussels and the United States Through its media briefings and expert reactions which offer journalists canned quotes from experts about breaking science stories the SMC is influential in shaping global media coverage of science often in ways that favor its corporate funders according to several reports SMC experts have frequently downplayed the harms of pesticides food additives ultra processed foods and other products that raise health and environmental concerns This fact sheet describes SMC s history funding tactics and analyses of their impact and messaging Science Media Centre corporate funding SMC s largest share of funding roughly 30 comes from corporations and trade groups Funders as of 2023 included a wide range of chemical pharmaceutical nuclear and food industry interests Current funders include BASF Johnson Johnson Nestle UK AstraZeneca GlaxoSmithKline the Chemical Industries Association BioIndustry Association Nuclear Industry Association and FoodDrinkEurope which represents the European food and drink industry Previous funders include Bayer DuPont CropLife International Monsanto ExxonMobile Shell Coca Cola and Kraft SMC also receives funding from several media government and academic groups SMC says it caps donations from any one company or institution to 5 of annual income in an effort to protect from undue influence Exceptions are made for larger donations from the Wellcome Trust and the UK government s Research and Innovation program Some critics have called on the Science Media Centre to stop taking money from corporations whose products the center at times defends Institutions and individuals who claim to have an interest in public health should end all financial relationships with the ultra processed food industry and instead they should advocate for expanded public funding to support

influence and impact The SMC model has been influential in shaping media coverage about science A media analysis of UK newspapers in 2011 and 2012 found that a majority of reporters who used SMC services did not seek additional perspectives for their stories The group also wields political influence In 2007 SMC stopped a proposed ban on human animal hybrid embryos with its media campaign to shift coverage from ethical concerns to the benefits of embryos as a research tool according to an article in Nature Several academics and researchers have criticized SMC for pushing corporate views of science and for playing down the environmental and human health risks of controversial products and technologies Reports have documented SMC s efforts to promote industry views and exclude opposing perspectives on topics such as ultra processed foods fracking cell phone safety Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and GMOs In an email SMC Director Fiona Fox said her group is not biased in favor of industry We listen carefully to any criticism of the SMC from the scientific community or news journalists working for UK media but we do not receive criticism of pro industry bias from these stakeholders We reject the charge of pro industry bias and our work reflects the evidence and views of the 3000 eminent scientific researchers on our database As an independent press office focusing on some of the most controversial science stories we fully expect criticism from groups outside mainstream science No disclosure of industry ties in media coverage In September 2023 Andrew Gregory reported in the Guardian that three out of five scientists on an SMC expert panel that suggested ultra processed foods UPF are being unfairly demonized had ties to the world s largest food manufacturers The experts had either received financial support for research from UPF manufacturers or hold key positions with organizations that are funded by them The manufacturers included Nestlé Mondelēz Coca Cola PepsiCo

journalists than there should be that are only using experts from the SMC and not consulting independent sources St Louis concluded Experts aren t always scientists David Miller professor of sociology from the University of Bath UK analyzed SMC content on the website and via Freedom of Information Act requests and reported Some 20 of the 100 most quoted SMC experts were not scientists as defined by having a PhD and working at a research institution or a top learned society but were lobbyists for and CEOs of industry groups Funding sources were not always completely or timely disclosed online There was no evidence of SMC favoring a particular funder but it did favor particular corporate sectors and topics it covered reflect the priorities of their funders If you say you quote scientists and end up using lobbyists and NGOs the question is how do you choose which lobbyists or NGOs to have Why don t you have lobbyists who oppose genetic testing or members of Greenpeace expressing their view rather than bioindustry s position That really reveals the kind of biases that are in operation Miller said Quotes about Science Media Centre Journalists and researchers on the influence and bias of the Science Media Centre emphases ours Science Media Centre history Britain s first Ministry of Truth According to the Science Media Centre founding report the group was created in 2002 to address a growing crisis of confidence in society s views of science a collapse of respect for authority and expertise a risk averse society and alarmist media coverage and the apparently superior media strategies used by environmental NGOs such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth By the late 1990s the relationship between science and media was at a breaking point explains the SMC promotional video Around the time of BSE MMR GM crops there was a real sense of this gulf between scientists and the media SMC Director Fiona Fox said in the video SMC would help renew public trust in science by

representing every major UK news outlet SMC uses three main tactics to influence science coverage according to its promotional video Rapid response to breaking news with opinion quotes When a science story breaks within minutes there are SMC emails in inboxes of every single national reporter offering experts said Fox Getting to reporters first with new research SMC has privileged access to about 10 15 scientific journals in advance of the embargo lifting so they can prepare advance comments from third party experts signaling whether new studies merit attention and how they should be framed

human animal hybrid embryos the SMC coordinated efforts to shift the focus of media coverage away from ethical concerns and toward the importance of hybrid embryos as a research tool according to an article in Nature The SMC campaign was a strategic triumph in media relations and was largely responsible for turning the tide of coverage on human animal hybrid embryos according to Andy Williams a media researcher at the University of Cardiff UK who conducted an analysis on behalf of SMC and campaign allies Williams found More than 60 of the sources in stories written by science and health reporters the ones targeted by the SMC supported the research and only one quarter of sources opposed to it By contrast journalists who had not been targeted by the SMC spoke to fewer supportive scientists and more opponents Williams now worries that the SMC efforts led reporters to give too much deference to scientists and that it stifled debate the Nature article reported An interview with Williams in SciDevNet reports A lot of the language used to describe SMC media briefings stresses that they were a chance for the scientists to explain the science in their own words but crucially in a neutral and value free way he said But this ignores the fact that these were tightly managed events pushing persuasive narratives he added and that they were set up to secure maximum media impact for the scientists involved Specialist science journalists were fed information subsidies by the SMC and were far more likely than other journalists to quote pro hybridisation sources Williams said Defending fracking with fossil fuel connected experts According to a February 2015 media analysis conducted by Paul Mobbs of Mobbs Environmental Investigations SMC offered numerous expert commentaries

powerful vested interest groups in its media work on chronic fatigue syndrome myalgic encephalomyelitis CFS ME Hooper s paper reports on links between the SMC and key players in the CFS ME controversy

media He concludes An organisation which behaves in such a blatantly unscientific way can have no legitimate claim to represent science For SMC views see 2018 fact sheet on CFS ME the illness and the controversy Promoting cell phone safety and telecom funders A 2006 paper by Don Maisch PhD raises serious concerns over the impartiality of the SMC model in science communication when tendering expert advice on contentious issues when vested interests are part of the SMC structure The Maisch paper explores SMC communications on issues involving electromagnetic radiation and cell phone safety and offers what he calls an uncensored history of the SMC model of science communication It is apparent that the agenda of SIRC SMC and allied organisations is to support the UK government s economic

appear authoritative and impressive someone consumers could trust But in using the IBD forum to rail against the small non profit consumer group we work for U S Right to Know he revealed his allegiance to certain industry interests who seek to keep consumers in the dark Our organization advocates for truth and transparency in the food system We spend most of our time filing information requests for data and documents from state and federal agencies and institutions to share with consumers about food policy matters Miller has become fairly well known for putting science and public health second to corporate interests He was listed in a 1994 memo as a key supporter of Philip Morris campaign to fight tobacco regulations He was also named in an internal Monsanto Company document as a resource who could help discredit the World Health Organization s cancer research panel after it declared Monsanto s key herbicide to be a probable human carcinogen That weed killer glyphosate is widely used globally in agricultural food production The Monsanto plan to protect its weed killer could not have been more clear Engage Henry Miller it states Documents reported by The New York Times

to attack our little nonprofit The answer is easy Investigations by U S Right to Know have turned up hidden documents many of them now posted in the UCSF Chemical Industry Documents Archive that have sparked multiple media investigations into the lobbying and propaganda operations of the food and agrichemical industries Articles about secretive food industry strategies to mislead consumers lawmakers and investors have been published in the New York Times BMJ the Guardian Le Monde Bloomberg Boston Globe CBC public health journals and many other outlets P R Shenanigans Along with Miller Monsanto tapped many other industry partners to try to discredit the scientists who warned about Monsanto s herbicide including the Genetic Literacy Project Grocery Manufacturers Association and other food industry funded groups These are the sorts of public relations shenanigans the food brands should shun if they hope to gain consumer trust For the record we have no ties whatsoever to Russia We are a food industry watchdog group We examine how the food and agri chemical industries operate behind the scenes to influence lawmakers regulators academics and others And we share that information with the public Truth and transparency are scary concepts for certain corporate interests to be sure But these corporate players and their investors would be wise to listen to and appreciate consumer

people cancer focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concern about the issue The unscrupulous means Monsanto used to protect its profits tactics Bayer continues to this day as it maneuvers to keep glyphosate on the market may have been desperate and underhanded but they were also perfectly legal former Nature editor Mark Buchanan explained in Bloomberg Companies can get away with selling dangerous products he wrote because the current science regulators rely on for toxicity testing is wildly out of date A 2021 study from the Institute of Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna underscores the point Researchers reviewed 53 safety studies on glyphosate submitted to regulators by large chemical companies and found that most did not comply with modern international standards for scientific rigor Most of the studies did not even include tests that are most able to detect cancer risks All of this adds to

week s hearings https www facebook com USRightToKnow videos 1662246967174627 Showdown in San Fran underway The showdown is underway in San Francisco Teams of dark suited attorneys filled the courtroom of U S District Judge Vince Chhabria on Monday morning to wrestle over the science surrounding cancer concerns and Monsanto s Roundup herbicide With more than 365 lawsuits combined in the multi district litigation under the purview of Judge Chhabria there were more plaintiffs attorneys than seats at the plaintiffs table so they spilled out into the rows set aside for the public Laptops and yellow lined legal pads crowded the tables for the opposing counsels as many furiously took notes and kept track of the time well aware that each side has a limit of 11 hours to present their scientific case to the judge in a hearing that runs through Friday The plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have scientific evidence to back their claims that glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup causes non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL The hearings are an interim but very important step in the litigation as these hearings allow for Chhabria to determine if the expert scientists plaintiffs have lined up to testify regarding causation will be permitted to testify at trial The focus in those determinations is whether the experts used a recognized reliable methodology for arriving at their opinions If the judge the litigation can proceed to trial ajury would then decide whether the evidence more likely than not shows Roundup caused the individual s NHL First up to testify is plaintiffs expert witness BeateRitz Chair of the Epidemiology Department at UCLA of Occupational and Environmental Health COEH Under the questioning of plaintiffs attorney Kathryn Forgie Ritz walked the judge through a series of epidemiology studies conducted over the years that show statistically significant risk factors linking glyphosate to cancer The literature shows that the risk to individuals considered routine users of glyphosate was significant she testified Judge Chhabria quizzed Ritz on several aspects of the scientific research and appeared concerned about whether or not studies were adjusted for exposure to other pesticides When asked about a study Monsanto has pointed to as critical evidence that there is no non Hodgkin lymphoma link to glyphosate Ritz explained that the study a

testified the AHS data on glyphosate relied heavily on memories of individuals filling out questionnaires to asses usage It also is smaller than desired and has not followed people long enough she said Recall error is really the enemy of exposure assessment she said Getting Interesting A lawyer sitting next to me in first row describes this as the post lunch sag But it s just starting to get interesting After a brief lunch break epidemiologist Beate Ritz resumed testimony with a detailed discussion of meta analyses She says that with respect to glyphosate there is animal data but more importantly human data that shows an association between lymphoma and glyphosate She said DNA breaks have been shown to occur when individuals are exposed She says that her conclusion is that glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides do indeed cause NHL But when Judge Chhabria asks her to be more specific does she believe the pesticide is currently causing NHL or is capable of causing NHL she said it was the latter We know that the toxicology is in the dose she said That prompted some whispering among plaintiffs counsel and further questioning under which Ritz said it would depend on the individual s cases Monsanto attorneys now get their shot at Ritz Ritz Concludes Testimony With Congrats from Judge Whew Five hours of testimony featuring plaintiffs expert witness epidemiologist Beate Ritz concluded in chuckles all around as Federal Court Judge Vince Chhabria told Ritz congratulations for her enthusiastic though sometimes prickly testimony regarding her views of multiple studies looking at glyphosate and connections to cancer specifically non Hodgkin lymphoma Chhabria had to admonish Ritz more than once during her cross examination by Monsanto attorney Eric Lasker to stop asking Lasker questions and telling him what questions to ask The judge offered in jest to set aside time later in the week for Ritz to do her own cross examination of Lasker in what was a rare light moment in the otherwise serious scrutiny of the science Before she exited the witness chair Chhabria asked her if she believes that current levels of glyphosate exposures is causing or has caused non Hodgkin lymphoma Ritz said that good exposure quantification data is lacking but when pressed by the judge to say whether or not the studies she reviewed show that glyphosate has caused NHL

pathologist who specializes in the study of NHL takes the stand He is Chair of the Pathology Department of the City of Hope Medical Center Omaha Nebraska Carey Gillam There is biological plausibility A long day of testimony presented by plaintiffs witnesses concluded with strong statements by NHL expert Dennis Weisenburger laying out multiple studies that lend support to the plaintiffs allegations that Monsanto s glyphosate based Roundup herbicide causes non Hodgkin lymphoma As he did with prior witness Beate Ritz the judge asked Weisenburger if he believed not just that the pesticide was capable of causing NHL but if it is at exposures people are currently experiencing Weisenburger answered affirmatively The body of evidence is strong evidence said Weisenburger Glyphosate and the glyphosate based formulations including Roundup can cause non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL he told Judge Chhabria Weisenburger spent time walking the court through studies that show DNA damage in people exposed to glyphosate including through aerial spraying Research shows that both glyphosate and formulations cause genetic damage the type that leads to NHL he said There is biological plausibility He testified that both animal studies and studies of human exposed to glyphosate showed connections between the chemical and cancer In one study the North American Pooled Project NAPP the risk for NHL increased almost two fold when for people who used glyphosate more than two days per year In animal studies Weisenburger said there were dose related effects for multiple tumors As well one mouse study showed rare tumors in exposed animals There is a body of evidence that is pretty compelling that glyphosate and the formulations are genotoxic in living cells he testified Like Ritz Weisenburger was dismissive of new results recently published as part of the Agricultural Health Study that showed no connection between glyphosate and NHL Though Monsanto has sought to portray this research as definitive evidence of no relationship between cancer and its weed killer both scientists who testified today said the research has several flaws that made it unreliable for a determination on

underway for the second day of science week with plaintiffs expert witness Dennis Weisenburger due to get back on the stand Weisenburger Chair of the Pathology Department of the City of Hope Medical Center in Omaha Nebraska specializes in the study of non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Weisenburger spent much of Monday afternoon summarizing for Judge Vince Chhabria his belief that analysis of many research studies provides strong evidence that glyphosate and glyphosate based weed killers like Monsanto s Roundup can cause exposed individual s to develop NHL Monsanto attorneys will get their chance to cross examine Weisenburger Tuesday afternoon after he completes his direct testimony Each side is claiming they have science on their side The question before this Court is all about the science Monsanto attorneys wrote in a pre hearing court filing The science at issue consists of actual studies and data not conjecture and speculation Monsanto argues that plaintiffs evidence is littered with carefully selected out of context e mails memoranda and other internal Monsanto documents which according to plaintiffs allegations in their briefing show purported ghostwriting of review articles not original studies themselves or allegedly improper corporate conduct Plaintiffs counter to that argument is this The methodology applied by Monsanto s experts turns not on sound science but rather on whether the evidence at issue is favorable or unfavorable to Monsanto s position Where the evidence is favorable it receives minimal scrutiny and Monsanto s experts often fail to find any flaws or shortcomings Yet when the evidence shows a positive association between exposure to glyphosate based formulations GBFs and Non Hodgkin Lymphoma NHL Monsanto s experts concoct an inquiry that consistently leads them to disregard the positive evidence in its entirety Inconsistencies or controverting evidence do not curtail this approach Rather when confronted with reliable positive evidence of causation Monsanto s experts develop novel methods to discount findings including manufacturing new theories or facts Plaintiffs initial exhibit list totaled 252 listed items while Monsanto s

estimated 1 500 pages of data from a controversial 1983 mouse study that EPA scientists initially saw as concerning evidence of the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate Monsanto was eventually successful in convincing EPA that its analysis was flawed and that the study actually reflected no reason for concern Plaintiffs have sought to dig into that study data which Monsanto has opposed The hundreds of pages of raw data that plaintiffs seek to have de designated are inarguably confidential Monsanto wrote of the plaintiffs desire to discuss the mouse study in the hearings this week One issue that the experts must address for Judge Chhabria has to do with studies that make connections between glyphosate exposure and NHL but do not adjust for exposure to other pesticides The judge stated multiple times that he sees that as a concern and wants a better understanding of the issue as the hearing progresses This continues to be an issue for me he said shortly before court concluded on Monday The judge also has warned attorneys that he needs a better understanding of the issue of recall bias in epidemiology research and how that may impact findings Following Weisenburger s

possible to connect glyphosate to non Hodgkin lymphoma in people diagnosed in the late 1970s and early 1980s given glyphosate only came on the market in 1974 and given expert testimony that NHL can take more than two decades to develop from pesticide exposure The judge suggested it should be assumed that something other than glyphosate caused the NHL in those people who were part of early studies That is obviously what the defense is trying to say Weisenburger replied but acknowledged that there are other pesticides associated with non Hodgkin lymphoma Next on the stand Alfred Neugut a practicing medical oncologist who is professor of cancer research and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia University In his opening direct testimony he says there is great specificity with research showing a connection between glyphosate and NHL Scientists do not see repeated evidence of ties between glyphosate and several other types of cancer but commonly see non Hodgkin lymphoma Every time you look what comes up Glyphosate and NHL he said Neugut testified that there is no perfect scientific study but consistency in study findings cannot be ignored He spoke so rapidly that the judge and court reporter had to caution him to slow down I m from Brooklyn he replied drawing courtroom laughter Carey Gillam Shit Happens Expert witness Alfred Neugut testifying for plaintiffs Tuesday addressed a study that Monsanto has claimed is significant evidence backing its claims that says glyphosate and Roundup do not cause non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL The Agricultural Health Study AHS is an excellent study for many things Neugut said but for understanding any association or lack of between glyphosate and NHL the study fails he testified An extraordinary increase in the use of glyphosate that started in the late 1990s dramatically changed the exposure level of farmers to glyphosate from the beginning of the study when baseline exposures were established There are other

an extra 60 minutes to present their expert witness testimony added to the total of 11 hours each side has been allotted for this week s events The judge said because he has frequently taken up some of plaintiffs time with questions of witnesses he decided the extra time was warranted Plaintiffs had requested an additional 90 minutes Monsanto is not due any extra time he said The judge also noted that he had received an email message from a citizen regarding the proceedings but that he had elected not to read the message He did pass copies of it to both plaintiffs and Monsanto s attorneys The hearing Wednesday began with a continuation of Monsanto s cross of plaintiffs witness Alfred Neugut an expert in epidemiology who is a practicing medical oncologist and professor of cancer research and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia University Monsanto attorney Eric Lasker pushed Neugut on his position on the science and repeatedly challenged the scientist s memory regarding previous statements and analysis that the attorney portrayed as conflicting with his testimony in these events Neugut at one point said he must have been mistaken before but was now correct Following Neugut s testimony the focus of the hearing today will move from epidemiology to toxicology research that plaintiffs cite as evidence backing their claims that Monsanto s weed killer causes cancer The first toxicology expert to take the stand will be Charles Jameson who goes by Bill Jameson has served as program leader for the National Toxicology Program at the NIH s National Institute of

180306VC Vol_ 2 pdf Carey Gillam Testimony About Animal Tumor Data Testimony by toxicology expert Bill Jameson on Wednesday sparked early objections from Monsanto attorneys as the former government scientist explained the body of research that led him to conclude that glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides like Roundup can cause non Hodgkin lymphoma at real world exposures levels farm workers and others face when using the weed killer Judge Vince Chhabria overruled Monsanto s objections Jameson was a member of the working group of the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC which analyzed research on glyphosate and declared it to be a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 Judge Chhabria posed several questions to Jameson about that IARC finding noting that in human studies the IARC group concluded there was limited evidence of carcinogenicity compared to sufficient evidence in animal research That led Jameson to explain that some scientists on the IARC working group thought the evidence was stronger than limited but others disagreed Jameson joked If there are three epidemiologists in a room and you ask them their opinions you ll get four opinions He like the scientists who testified Monday and Tuesday said it is the weight of the combined animal and human data that demonstrates the carcinogenicity of the herbicide There are many animal studies on glyphosate Jameson testified saying that it is extraordinary to have so many animal studies to evaluate a chemical due to the cost of such studies The fact that researchers have as many animal studies as they do for glyphosate adds to the strength of his conclusion that the chemical causes cancer he said Importantly the animal research shows there is replication of several tumor sites including

Monsanto had only provide the judge with one small segment of Jameson s actual statement regarding the data The entire statement provided the needed context for the court she said After lunch break Monsanto crosses Jameson Following a short break for lunch Monsanto attorney Joe Hollingsworth stepped up to cross examine plaintiffs expert witness Bill Jameson Hollingsworth launched his cross by pressing Jameson about distinctions between hazard and risk assessments and comments Jameson made in a deposition They judge admonished Hollingsworth and suggested that rather than continuously asking Jameson about what he said in a deposition the attorney should ask him about what he actually thinks Why don t you ask his about his opinion now the judge told Hollingsworth That s normally how we do it the judge said Hollingsworth did adjust his inquiry but when again asking Jameson about comments he made in a deposition led Jameson to reply that in his depositions taken by Monsanto I ve been misquoted and things have been taken out of context so many times When Hollingsworth continues to press Jameson to address comments Hollingsworth says Jameson made in a deposition the judge again interrupts to admonish Hollingsworth say that if Hollingsworth wants to ask Jameson questions about prior deposition testimony in the way that he is asking then Hollingsworth must provide him the full transcript of the deposition and the page number that contains the comment The Monsanto attorney say he has the comment available on a slide to show Jameson and the court The judge tells him that is

including saying it is his fault for talking over Jameson as the witness tries to answer questions Carey Gillam Little Bit of Legal Drama A little bit of legal drama in afternoon testimony by plaintiffs expert witness Bill Jameson as Judge Vince Chhabria repeatedly admonished Monsanto lead attorney Joe Hollingsworth over his tactics in cross examining Jameson Chhabria seems especially vexed by Hollingsworth s effort to open a line of questioning by asking Jameson about statements he made in a deposition The judge told Hollingsworth multiple times throughout the cross examination to ask Jameson directly what his opinions about the science are now and then if that contradicted something he said earlier Hollingsworth could explore the contradiction He also criticized Hollingsworth for talking over Jameson as he tried to answer questions The judge showed noted concern over the possibility that Monsanto might be taking expert statements out of context That concern was underscored when in a particularly stern move that left plaintiffs attorneys giddy with delight Judge Chhabria ordered Monsanto s attorney to read aloud into the record two pages of testimony from a deposition that supported the expertise of Jameson s analysis before he would allow Hollingsworth to introduce a separate example from a deposition that undercut Jameson s expertise Hollingsworth protested the action but finally capitulated as the judge insisted He then ended his cross examination of Jameson As Jameson s testimony ended and he stepped down from the witness stand he turned to the judge Thank you for the honor your honor he said Following Jameson Chris Portier another in the line up of plaintiffs expert witnesses took the stand Portier who traveled from his home in Switzerland to testify expressed a bit of nervousness before beginning his testimony under direct examination from New York based attorney Robin Greenwald Portier introduced his expert view that the probability that glyphosate cause non Hodgkin lymphoma is high In his testimony Portier tacked the Greim 2015 study which Monsanto and supporters have said supports their position that glyphosate doesn t cause cancer

Wagstaff requested judicial assistance from the judge but retreated after Lasker said they had written notes on the slide deck and refused to give them back A long day of testimony wrapped up with plaintiffs expert witness Chris Portier laying out for the court detailed and highly technical methodology and analysis that he said supports his views that glyphosate has a strong causal connection to non Hodgkin lymphoma Monsanto has criticized Portier for pooling results from multiple research studies in ways that are aimed at intentionally generating data that favors plaintiffs claims against Monsanto but Portier denied that bias in his testimony Wednesday The scientist explained such things as latency to the court and discussed his sensitivity analysis of studies done in rats and mice in the 1980s and 1990s More direct testimony is slated for Thursday morning from Portier and then his cross examination After that Monsanto will likely get its turn to present its own experts to the judge The company has said they will present four witnesses After this week s testimony lawyers for both sides will get their chance to make oral arguments to the judge sometime in the next two weeks The judge will make a ruling on whether or not the plaintiffs witnesses who are providing their scientific opinions regarding causation will be permitted to testify at trial The focus for the judge s decision is whether the experts are using recognized reliable methodology to arrive at their opinions If he determines any or all of the witnesses are not relying on this proper scientific foundation

to determine whether chemicals cause cancer The agency has a high bar to consider what it reviews he said exposures must be high and animal data strong Since 1965 IARC has reviewed 1003 agents and found 20 to be carcinogens 120 classified as carcinogenic and 81 classified as probably carcinogenic including glyphosate In my opinion the NHL risk of glyphosate exposure is clinically significant

discussed in her view the strengths and limitations of four epidemiological studies transcript here with details in particular the AHS study Investigators of the AHS cohort analysis reported no evidence of association between exposure to glyphosate and risk of NHL accounting for both short and long term exposures Much of Dr Mucci s testimony focused on questions from the judges about the validity of self reporting in the questionnaires filled out by pesticide applicators about their exposure to glyphosate Dr Mucci explained why she believes the reporting was reliable and is confident in the study findings of no evidence of positive association betweenexposure and NHL risk and no evidence of dose response In cross examination Dr Mucci clarified that her expert opinion was based on epidemiological data that IARC looked at and that has come out since the updated AHS and updated analysis of the North American Pooled Project She did not consider toxicological data or animal data

ghostwriting of an important paper published in the year 2000 and how the company used that independent scientific literature to promote and defend its herbicides Background Three years after Germany s Bayer AG bought Monsanto in 2018 Bayer set aside more than 16 billion to cover litigation liability associated with thousands of U S lawsuits alleging Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup cause a type of cancer called non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL After losing three out of three trials in cases brought against Monsanto by cancer victims Bayer said in June 2020 that it would pay more than 10 billion to settle roughly 100 000 of the claims The proposed resolution came two years after Bayer bought Monsanto for 63 billion and one year after U S District Judge Vince Chhabria ordered Bayer Monsanto to enter into mediation with plaintiffs attorneys The settlement became mired in difficulties and drew complaints from plaintiffs who said the individual amounts they ve been offered are too little to constitute fair compensation While many law firms have reached settlement agreements with Bayer many others have not as of August 2021 In late July 2021 Bayer said it would set aside another 4 5 billion to cover Roundup cancer claims The company also said it would stop selling Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides to U S consumers by 2023 but would keep selling the products to commercial applicators and farmers Bayer also said that in addition to replacing its glyphosate based products in the U S residential market with new formulations using alternative ingredients it would explore changes to Roundup labeling It is important for the company our owners and our customers that we move on and put the uncertainty and ambiguity related to the glyphosate litigation behind us Bayer CEO Werner Baumann said during a July 2021 investor call The company also said it would seek to have the U S Supreme Court review of one of its trial losses in hopes it would overturn the loss and preclude continued litigation In the event of a negative Supreme Court outcome Bayer said it would set up a claims administration program that will offer pre determined compensation values to eligible individuals who used Roundup and developed non Hodgkin lymphoma over the next 15 years More details According to Bayer s June 2020 announcement the company was to pay

Monsanto limiting evidence jurors heard during a first phase to causation only On March 19 2019 a unanimous jury decision handed a first round victory to Hardeman as the six jury members found that Hardeman s exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his non Hodgkin lymphoma On March 27 2019 the jury returned a verdict of approximately 80 million including punitive damages of 75 million Judge Chhabria reduced the punitive damages awarded Hardeman to 20 million from 75 million putting the total award at 25 313 383 02 Court discovery documents are posted below for Edwin

fourth Roundup cancer trial Stephen v Monsanto got underway in August 2021 The first trial in the Roundup litigation concluded on Aug 10 2018 with the jury ruling that Monsanto s weedkiller was a substantial contributing factor in causing DeWayne Lee Johnson s cancer and ordering Monsanto to pay 289 25 million in damages including 250 million in punitive damages The judge reduced the punitive damages to 39 million in an order dated Oct 22 2018 which put the total verdict at approximately 78 million Monsanto appealed seeking to throw out the judgment while Johnson cross appealed seeking to

Anticipation is building around the belief that there could soon be an announcement of at least a partial settlement of U S lawsuits pitting thousands of U S cancer patients against Monsanto Co over allegations the company hid the health risks of its Roundup herbicides Investors in Bayer AG the German company that bought Monsanto in 2018 are keeping a close eye on the status of three trials currently still on the docket to get underway this month Six trials were initially set to take place in January but three have recently been postponed Sources say the postponements are part of the process of obtaining an overall settlement with several plaintiffs attorneys who have large numbers of cases pending The three trials still on the docket for this month are as follows Caballero v Monsanto set to start Jan 17 in Contra Costa Superior Court in California Wade v Monsanto set to start Jan 21 in St Louis City Circuit Court in Missouri and Cotton v Monsanto scheduled for Jan 24 in Riverside Superior Court in California A hearing scheduled for today in the Caballero case was called off but another hearing is set for Thursday before the trial gets underway Friday according to court filings Possibly underscoring the fluidity of the situation at least one of the key witnesses expected to testify in the case has been told he will not likely be needed according to a source close to the litigation In St Louis Monsanto s former hometown the court calendar calls for the Wade trial to get underway in front of Judge Elizabeth Byrne Hogan a week from today said court spokesman Thom Gross Plaintiffs attorney Mike Miller who represents plaintiff Kathleen Caballero as well as multiple plaintiffs in the Wade trial said he was looking forward to the trials for these victims of Monsanto s deceit Miller said rumors that his trials would be postponed are false and he fully intends for the trials to go forward Miller and other attorneys involved in the litigation have declined to answer questions about a potential settlement But analysts who follow Bayer say that settlement discussions are looking at a potential deal for 8 billion to settle current cases with 2 billion set aside for future needs After losing three out of three trials and facing thousands of claims by cancer victims who allege their diseases were caused by exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate

Johnson v Monsanto hearing A California appeals court looks poised to issue a ruling that would uphold the first U S trial victory involving allegations that Monsanto s Roundup weed killer causes

the question of damages awarded in the case at a hearing scheduled for June 2 The fact that the court is showing it is interested in discussing what amount of damages are appropriate rather than issues pertaining to Monsanto s request to overturn the trial loss entirely bodes well for the plaintiff s side said legal observers Monsanto August 2018 loss to Johnson a California school groundskeeper marked the first of three Roundup trial losses for the company which was acquired by Germany s Bayer AG nearly two years ago The jury in the Johnson case found that Monsanto was negligent in failing to warn Johnson of the cancer risk of its herbicides and awarded Johnson 289 million in damages including 250 million in punitive damages The trial judge later lowered the award to 78 5 million But the loss sent Bayer s shares spirally lower and stoked investor unrest that has persisted as the number of additional Roundup cancer claims filed against Monsanto have grown In appealing the verdict Monsanto asked the court to either reverse the trial decision and enter a judgment for Monsanto or reverse and remand the case for a new trial Monsanto argued that the verdict was flawed because of exclusion of key evidence and the distortion of reliable science If nothing else Monsanto asked the appeals court to reduce the portion of the jury award for future noneconomic damages from 33 million to 1 5 million and to wipe out the punitive damages altogether Monsanto s argument on reducing future non economic damages is based on the company s position that Johnson is likely to die soon and thus will not suffer long term future pain and suffering Johnson cross appealed seeking reinstatement of the full jury award of 289 million Ahead of the hearing on the matter the judicial panel said this The parties should be ready to address the following issue at oral argument currently scheduled for June 2 2020 Assume that this court agrees with Monsanto Company that

Axelrad told judges with the California Court of Appeal First Appellate District Axelrad said Monsanto had no duty to warn anyone about an alleged cancer risk given the regulatory consensus that its weed killers are safe It is fundamentally unfair to hold Monsanto liable and punish it for a product label that accurately reflects not only EPA determination but a worldwide consensus that glyphosate is not carcinogenic he argued in the hour long hearing The proceeding was held by telephone because of COVID 19 restrictions on courthouse access Associate Justice Gabriel Sanchez questioned the validity of that argument You have animal studies mechanism studies you have control case studies he said addressing Monsanto s attorney There are a number of it seems published peer reviewed studies that suggest a statistically significant relationship between glyphosate and lymphoma So I don t know that I would agree with you that it has unanimous consensus Certainly the regulatory agencies seem to be on one side But there is a lot of other evidence on the other The appeal stems from the 2018 jury decision in San Francisco Superior Court that ordered Monsanto to pay 289 million to Dewayne Lee Johnson including 250 million in punitive damages The trial judge in the Johnson case lowered the award to 78 5 million But Monsanto appealed the verdict asking the court to either reverse the trial

had argued that he should get 1 million a year for pain and suffering over the 33 additional years that he would likely live if he had not gotten cancer But Monsanto s attorneys have said Johnson should get only 1 million a year for pain and suffering during his actual life expectancy or 1 5 million for an 18 month expected future span On Tuesday Axelrad reiterated that point Sure a plaintiff can recover during his lifetime for the pain and suffering that might be occasioned by knowing that he has a shortened life expectancy he told the judicial panel But you cannot recover for pain and suffering that is unlikely to occur in years where you will no longer be living and that is what the plaintiff received in this case Axelrad told the justices that the company had been falsely painted

scientists had only made editorial suggestions for several papers published in the scientific literature Whether or not Monsanto could have been more forthcoming in identifying its involvement in those studies the bottom line is that those studies produced no false or misleading information and there is no indication that any of the authors of those studies would have changed their opinion had

Former Monsanto Chairman and CEO Hugh Grant will have to testify in person at a St Louis area trial set for January in litigation brought by a cancer stricken woman who claims her disease was caused

AG of Germany in June of 2018 and spent a total of 37 years working for Monsanto was subpoenaed by lawyers for plaintiff Sharlean Gordon to testify at a trial slated to begin Jan 27 in St Louis County Circuit Court The Gordon trial was originally scheduled for August of this year but was delayed as part of an effort to undertake settlement talks between Bayer and lawyers for tens of thousands of plaintiffs who are suing Monsanto with claims similar to Gordon s Two other trials set for January both in courts in California and both involving children diagnosed with cancer were recently postponed due to continued settlement talks Bayer estimates that there are currently more than 42 000 plaintiffs alleging that exposure to Monsanto s Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides made by Monsanto caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma Grant did not have to testify live at the three Roundup cancer trials that have taken place so far because they were all held in California But because Grant resides in St Louis County plaintiffs attorneys saw an opportunity to get him on the stand in person Attorneys for Grant have been fighting the subpoena arguing that he is not a scientist or regulatory expert and he has already provided information in deposition testimony Grant has also argued that he should not have to testify because he plans to be out of the country starting February 9 But in a decision handed down Dec 5 a special master appointed to the case sided with Gordon s attorneys and ruled that Grant was not entitled to an order quashing the subpoena for trial testimony Mr Grant appeared for interviews on public radio representing that Roundup is not a carcinogen in earnings calls for investors Mr Grant personally responded that the classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen was junk science in 2016 Mr Grant personally lobbied the EPA Administrator and the Agricultural Committee Chair of the topic of glyphosate the

of Appeal 1st Appellate District said it would act swiftly in ruling on the consolidated appeals and lawyers for both sides initially hoped to have a ruling by the end of this year But the case has been delayed for several weeks as both sides awaited a date for oral arguments On Dec 3 Monsanto s attorneys asked the court not to schedule oral arguments in January or February as several new Roundup trials are set for those months Johnson s attorneys opposed that request for further delay On Friday the court issued an order stating that while it agreed with Johnson about the need to

attorney Brent Wisner implored jurors to agree with allegations that the development of the Pilliods debilitating illnesses was due to their many years of use of Monsanto s Roundup herbicides Monsanto strongly denies its products are carcinogenic But Pilliod attorney Brent Wisner told jurors there was ample evidence of cancer concerns and rather than warn customers of the risks the company engaged in 45 years of deceptive tactics that manipulated the scientific record about the dangers of its products He said jurors should consider ordering at least 892 million in punitive damages as that

for approximately 37 million in compensatory damages for Alberta Pilliod and 18 million for Alva Pilliod Hold them accountable Wisner told jurors in a three hour closing argument During his presentation to jurors Wisner reminded them of evidence introduced over the lengthy trial He walked them through several scientific studies he said showed links to cancer showed them excerpts of internal Monsanto emails that talked about ghostwriting scientific papers and covertly paying front groups such as the American Council on Science and Health ACSH to publicly promote the safety of its

showing Monsanto strategies to discredit international cancer scientists who classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen Wisner said Monsanto buried studies that found harm with its products and promoted ghostwritten studies that promoted safety engaging in conduct that was reprehensible That ladies and gentlemen is how you manipulate science he said In contrast Monsanto attorney Tarek

Pro Glyphosate Efforts How badly did Monsanto want to discredit international cancer scientists who found the company s glyphosate herbicide to be a probable human carcinogen and promote a counter message of glyphosate safety instead Badly enough to allocate about 17 million for the mission in just one year alone according to evidence obtained by lawyers representing cancer victims suing Monsanto That detail and others about the internal workings of Monsanto public relations operations have come to light in a Jan 22 video taped deposition of Monsanto executive Sam Murphey Murphey s job at Monsanto included directing global media relations and advocacy efforts in support of major litigation policy matters and reputational threats involving the company s glyphosate based herbicide business And one of the biggest threats came from those cancer scientists Murphey now works for Bayer after the German company purchased Monsanto last summer U S District judge Vince Chhabria did not allow Murphey s disclosure of the anti IARC budget to be introduced into evidence in the Hardeman V Monsanto trial which went to the jury for deliberation on Tuesday Jurors in that San Francisco case already determined that Monsanto s glyphosate based Roundup caused Hardeman s non Hodgkin lymphoma but now are weighing damages But the Murphey evidence is expected to be introduced at the Pilliod V Monsanto trial that concluded jury selection in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland California on Tuesday The parties selected a jury of 12 members and five alternates Opening statements in that case are expected Thursday It has been four years since the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC reviewed the published and peer reviewed scientific literature regarding glyphosate and found the herbicide to be probably carcinogenic with a particular association to non Hodgkin lymphoma IARC is part of the World Health Organization and has classified over 1 000 substances as to their cancer hazard typically without too much controversy But glyphosate was different Following the March 2015 classification hundreds and then thousands of people diagnosed with non Hodgkin lymphoma after exposures to Monsanto s herbicides filed suit against the agrochemical giant Also immediately after the IARC classification of glyphosate and continuing to this day the cancer scientists became the subject of sweeping condemnation from an assortment of organizations individuals and even some U S lawmakers They have been accused of operating not on sound science but on behalf of a political

from Monsanto In his deposition Murphey was asked how much the company spent trying to cast doubt upon the IARC classification Here is a bit of the exchange Plaintiff attorney Pedram Esfandiary So it s true that Monsanto s allocated millions of dollars in responding to the IARC classification correct Murphey We we have we had to spend a significant amount of resources over several years now correcting misinformation and addressing questions in the public about about glyphosate Esfandiary Has Monsanto allocated millions of dollars to responding to the IARC classification Murphey Yes Esfandiary Do you know roughly how much Monsanto allocated to it in 2016 Murphey I can only speak within the context of you know public affairs activities you know things that I would have been directly involved in But in 2016 you know I believe for some of the projects I was involved in it was around 16 or 17 million Esfandiary 16 or 17 million was allocated to responding to the IARC clarification stet Murphey No not specifically and solely focused on IARC It s it would have focused on engagement and media relations and other activities on glyphosate more generally Esfandiary then asked Murphey how much it would have cost the company to perform a long term cancer bioassay test of its formulated glyphosate products something the company has acknowledged it never did Murphey said he did not know The year 2016 was a particularly critical time for Monsanto because in addition to facing litigation the company s glyphosate license was up for renewal in Europe and the U S Environmental Protection Agency was also reviewing glyphosate s registration How Was the Money Spent In the deposition Murphey was asked about a July 2015 internal Monsanto document called IARC Follow Up that cited a goal to invalidate relevance of IARC and protect freedom to operate FTO He was asked about a host of actions undertaken to minimize or discredit IARC s work that were laid out in that

third party channels One example of using an outside party to parrot Monsanto talking points was an article that appeared on the Forbes contributor platform that appeared to be written by Henry Miller who at the time was a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University Internal Monsanto documents show the piece criticizing IARC was actually drafted by Monsanto and sent to Miller with a request for him to publish the materials Other Op Ed maneuvers Just prior to the IARC classification Monsanto executive Dan Goldstein discussed five potential draft Op Eds he said he had written for medical toxicologists to work from that included paragraphs on criticism of IARC Goldstein was emailing the draft opinion articles out to doctors and scientists with the hope that they would adopt the drafts as their own and have them published the records show Monsanto was available to coordinate Op Ed versions as needed Murphey said in his deposition Let Nothing Go strategy According to Murphey the initiative involved carefully monitoring media coverage with a focus on the European Union We had a number of markets we were we were prioritizing Murphey said The project called for monitoring stories and highlighting or flagging those that contained what Monsanto saw as inaccurate information or misinformation about the company or its products or stories that didn t include the company s perspective or point of view Someone would then be assigned to follow up with those reporters proactively calling reporters in those instances to share a statement to provide some additional context and to encourage those reporters to contact us in the future said Murphey Convincing a Reuters reporter to write a story undermining the validity of the IARC classification was another example of Murphey s work Emails from within Monsanto showed that Murphey sent a slide deck of talking points and a suggested narrative to Reuters reporter Kate Kelland asking her to write a story that accused Aaron Blair who was the chairman of the IARC working group on glyphosate of concealing data that would have changed IARC s conclusion on glyphosate Murphey told Kelland in an April 2017 email that it

Jan 8 2020 On Wednesday St Louis County Court spokeswoman Christine Bertelson confirmed that one trial set to start Jan 27 has been officially postponed with no new trial date yet set That trial was to pit a woman named Sharlean Gordon against Monsanto Discussions are underway to postpone one or more highly anticipated Roundup cancer trials set to start in January including trials scheduled for St Louis the former hometown of Roundup herbicide maker Monsanto Co according to sources close to the litigation Court dockets still show trials scheduled for later this month in St Louis and in

would put off the trials by several months if not longer Attorneys for Monsanto and for the plaintiffs in the upcoming January trials declined to comment The talk of trial delays is not unexpected Bayer AG the German company that bought Monsanto in June 2018 successfully negotiated the postponement of several trials that had been set for the fall of 2019 after losing each of the three trials held to date Each involved plaintiffs who claimed their cancers were caused by exposure to Roundup and other Monsanto glyphosate based herbicides The juries found not just that the company s herbicides can cause cancer but that Monsanto knew about the risks and hid the information from consumers Bayer has estimated more than 42 700 people have filed claims in the United States against Monsanto which is now a wholly owned unit of Bayer Bayer and a team of plaintiffs attorneys have been pursuing a potential settlement of the litigation that could amount to well more than 8 billion the legal sources said Bayer has been particularly uneasy about trials scheduled for St Louis where former Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant has been subpoenaed to testify and the trial of plaintiff Sharlean Gordon is to be broadcast to the public In the three previous trials all held in California Monsanto executives have given testimony through depositions and have not had to take the stand in front of

would be weakened if the jury verdicts are upheld on appeal But no decision is expected on the appeals for several more months at least In December the U S Department of Justice took the rare step of

reporter By Carey Gillam Update April 25 2019 We knew from previously released documents that Reuters reporter Kate Kelland was a key connection for Monsanto in its endeavor to undermine and discredit the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC scientists who classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in 2015 Now we have additional evidence of the coziness of the connection Not only did Kelland write a 2017 story that Monsanto asked her to write in exactly the way Monsanto executive Sam Murphey asked her to write it without disclosing to readers that Monsanto was the source but now we see evidence that a draft of a separate story Kelland did about glyphosate was delivered to Monsanto before it was published a practice typically frowned on by news outlets The emails shows the story written by Kelland was emailed before it was published to Murphey with the subject line My draft Confidential The story headlined New study on Monsanto weed killer to feed into crucial EU vote was about preliminary findings of an unpublished study by an Italian scientist showing that experimental rats exposed to glyphosate at levels equivalent to those allowed in humans showed no initial adverse reaction The final version was published on April 13 2017 And another newly released email details how Monsanto s fingerprints were on at least two other Kelland stories The March 1 2016 email speaks of the involvement of Monsanto s Red Flag campaign in an already published Reuters story that was critical of IARC and the desire to influence a second similar story Reuters was planning Red Flag is a Dublin based PR and lobbying firm that works to defend glyphosate safety and promote pro glyphosate messaging via third parties such as farmer groups According to the partly redacted email following engagement by Red Flag a number of months ago the first piece was quite critical of IARC The email goes on You may also be aware that Red Flag is in touch with Reuters regarding the second report in the series A little over a month later Reuters published Kelland s story headlined Special Report How the World Health Organization s cancer agency confuses consumers Those revelations follow the disclosure earlier this year of email correspondence detailing how Kelland helped Monsanto drive a false narrative about cancer scientist Aaron Blair in his role as head of the IARC working group that classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen In ternal Monsanto correspondence dated April 27 2017 shows that Monsanto executive Sam Murphey sent the company s

shows that Blair did not say that Kelland provided no link to the documents she cited making it impossible for readers to see for themselves how far she veered from accuracy The story was picked up by media outlets around the world and promoted by Monsanto and chemical industry allies Google advertisements were even purchased promoting the story This story was also used by Monsanto to attack IARC

at Reuters covering Monsanto and I am horrified at this violation of journalistic standards It is particularly noteworthy that Alix Freedman is the same person who told me I was not allowed to write about many independent scientific studies of Monsanto s glyphosate that were showing harmful impacts At the very least Kelland should have been honest with readers and acknowledged that Monsanto was

approve cancer warning labels required by the state of California for certain glyphosate based herbicide products The EPA said that labeling that states glyphosate is known to cause cancer is false and illegal and will not be allowed despite a California regulatory action ordering such labeling It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not pose a cancer risk We will not allow California s flawed program to dictate federal policy said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler California s listing of glyphosate as a substance known to cause cancer came after the World Health Organization s International Agency on the Research for Cancer IARC classified glyphosate in 2015 as probably carcinogenic to humans The fact that the EPA is taking this stance and found it necessary to issue a press release appears to validate internal Monsanto documents obtained through litigation discovery that show the EPA was believed to have Monsanto s back when it comes to glyphosate In a report attached to a July 2018 email to Monsanto global strategy official Todd Rands the strategic intelligence and advisory firm Hakluyt reported to Monsanto the

sold around the world But while Monsanto and other chemical companies insist the products do not cause cancer the evidence presented in the first two trials includes numerous published and peer reviewed scientific studies showing the products are carcinogenic The Pilliod suit echoes others in claiming that Monsanto led a prolonged campaign of misinformation to convince government agencies farmers and the general public that Roundup was safe despite knowing about the scientific evidence showing it was not safe Monsanto s new owner Bayer maintains that claims tying its herbicides to cancer are baseless and asserts its products have been labeled with proper warnings and instructions In its response to the Pilliod lawsuit Monsanto denies that Plaintiffs sustained or will sustain any injury damage or loss by reason of any act or omission of Monsanto Lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman said in a video interview that Bayer and Monsanto needed to start acting responsibly At some point this company needs to come clean and own up to the fact that its product is dangerous said attorney Jennifer Moore Judge Winifred Smith is presiding over the Pilliod case Attorneys for the plaintiffs anticipate the trial will last about a month Twelve jurors and five alternates have been selected Pilliod v Monsanto is the first case in the California Roundup Judicial Council

Revealed Document Says Internal Monsanto records just filed in court show that a corporate intelligence group hired to to take the temperature on current regulatory attitudes for glyphosate reported that the White House could be counted on to defend the company s Roundup herbicides In a report attached to a July 2018 email to Monsanto global strategy official Todd Rands the strategic intelligence and advisory firm Hakluyt reported to Monsanto the following A domestic policy adviser at the White House said for instance We have Monsanto s back on pesticides regulation We are prepared to go toe to toe on any disputes they may have with for example the EU Monsanto need not fear any additional regulation from this administration In the email accompanying the report Hakluyt s Nick Banner told Rands the information related to issues both for the United States and for China The report notes that professional staff has sharp disagreement with political staff on some areas but that the concerns of some of the professional staffers would not get in the way We heard a unanimous view from senior levels of the EPA and USDA that glyphosate is not seen as carcinogenic and that this is highly unlikely to change under this administration whatever the level of disconnect between political and professional staffers The report said that a former Environmental Protection Agency EPA lawyer and a U S Department of Agriculture USDA official confirmed that both agencies see the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classification of glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen as flawed and incomplete There is little doubt that the EPA supports the use of glyphosate the report says It quotes a current EPA lawyer as saying We have made a determination regarding glyphosate and feel very confident of the facts around it Other international bodies have reached different conclusions but in our view the data is just not clear and their decision is mistaken The report also suggests similarities between the Trump Administration s support for glyphosate and its actions around a pesticide called chlorpyrifos that is the active ingredient in an insecticide made by Dow Chemical now DowDupont There is a large body of science showing that chlorpyrifos is very damaging to children s brain development and that children are most often exposed through the food and water they consume Chlorpyrifos was due to be banned from agricultural use in 2017 because of its dangers but the Trump administration postponed the ban at the request of Dow and continues to allow its use in food production The Hakluyt reports says The way the EPA under the Trump administration has handled Chlorpyrifos might be instructive in how it would handle new science or new developments related to glyphosate At the time the report was delivered to Monsanto last", "chunk_id":

delivered to Monsanto last July Monsanto had just been acquired by the German company Bayer AG and was in the midst of defending itself in the first Roundup cancer trial That San Francisco case brought by cancer victim Dewayne Lee Johnson resulted in a unanimous jury verdict handed down in August ordering Monsanto to pay 289 million in damages to Johnson The judge in the case later lowered the amount to 78 million A second trial also held in San Francisco in a separate case resulted in an 80 2 million verdict for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman A third trial is underway now in Oakland California Closing arguments are scheduled for tomorrow in that case brought by a husband and wife who both have non Hodgkin lymphoma they allege is due to their decades of using Roundup The documents that include the Hakluyt report were filed in Alameda County Superior Court by lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the current case Alva and Alberta Pilliod The filing is in response to Monsanto s effort to tell jurors about a recently released EPA glyphosate assessment in which the agency reaffirmed its finding that glyphosate does not cause cancer The Pilliod lawyers say the Hakluyt communications with Monsanto speak directly to the credibility of the 2019 EPA glyphosate evaluation issued by an administration which holds itself out as favoring Monsanto s business interests Widening rift reported between political and professional staffers in regulatory agencies The Hakluyt report to Monsanto also notes that increasingly professional staffers inside most federal agencies are feeling at odds with political staffers on issues such as pesticide regulation climate science and other matters While this appears to be true of various agencies Health and Human Services Commerce Education Interior the Food and Drug Administration and so on the EPA may be the leading example of this phenomeno n The report quotes a prominent Washington DC law firm partner who has extensive contacts at the EPA as saying In essence the political leadership favors deregulation and dismisses the expert risk analysis It is especially averse to theoretical risk analysis for example on the risks of glyphosate about which a scientific consensus is yet to form With regard to glyphosate in particular the differences between political and professional staff are sharp The professional staffers those scientists and others who typically have been within an agency for many years through multiple administrations Within the EPA professional staffers", "chunk_id":
