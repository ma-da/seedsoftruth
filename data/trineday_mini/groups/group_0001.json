Phillips was CIA for Mexico City Chief of covert operations. The FBI suspected that he was “baby sitting” Oswald just before he left Mexico City. CIA documents released in 1997 show that the CIA thought it possible that an Oswald imposter was in Mexico City. The CIA Special Affairs staff (SAS) set up to direct a covert campaign to topple Castro, had an operational interest in Oswald weeks before the assassination. SAS executive officer Desmond FitzGerald and a few SAS officers kept their interest in Oswald from CIA Mexico City Chief of station Win Scott, and John Whitten, the experienced and respected CIA officer tasked to conduct the CIA internal investigation of Oswald. Whitten’s removal and replacement with Angleton reveals some of the factional fights and template for further investigation.45 When Oswald returned to Dallas, Ruth Paine, whose husband Michael was closely related to the Forbes and Cabot families, hosted him. One of Michael’s cousins, Thomas Dudley Cabot, had served as president of United Fruit. Michael’s mother, Ruth Forbes Paine Young, had a friendship with Allen Dulles’ lover, Mary Bancroft. Although Michael and Ruth were separated, Ruth stayed close to the Forbes family. Ruth’s sister Sylvia worked for the CIA and her father worked for the Agency for International Development (AID), which worked closely with the CIA. Recall that Marina Oswald lived with Ruth, and Ruth helped Lee get the job at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald appears to have started his intelligence career with ONI, and then worked as an asset with the CIA and FBI on a range of operations. Just who gave him his marching orders in 1963 remains a mystery. HSCA Chief Counsel Robert Blakey safely stated on Frontline in 1993, “He is not, to put it in simple words, an easy man to explain.” Elements of the Mafia, anti-Castro Cubans, and the CIA had mu-tual interests in overthrowing Castro, and they worked together in this regard. Havana was the Las Vegas of the 1940s and 1950s in part, from mafia investments. When the Bay of Pigs operation failed in 1961, and Kennedy cut back on anti-Castro operations, many of these factions saw him as a traitor to their cause. The Mafia had cooperated with the CIA and OSS in times past, and attempted to assassinate Castro in the early 1960s. Many authors have separated the roles of the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI, the Department of Defense, and the Dallas Police Department from the Mafia. This separation can be arbitrary and misleading since Oswald, Ruby, Roselli, Giancana, Banister, Trafficante, Helms, Harvey, Phillips, Hunt, Sturgis, Artime, Ferrie, Clay Shaw, Robert Maheu and a number of others were often working with two or more of these organizations.

Perhaps the concept of a gray alliance is useful. Warren Commission member Allen Dulles had been closely involved with the CIA-Mafia plots to assassinate Castro – plots which broke both national and international laws. CIA cooperation with the Mafia had existed with the CIA’s forerunner, the OSS, as early as 1942. The Mafia served as a junior partner with the United States government in operations including: Chairman Earl Warren conceivably had another reason to divert the investigation. His campaign manager in his race for Governor of California, Murray Chotiner, handled the legal defense in 221 Mafia prosecutions from 1949-1952.2 Chotiner was close to mob front-man D’Alton Smith, and brother-in-law of Marcello’s top associate, Nofio Pecora.3 (Chotiner was also Richard Nixon’s Senate Campaign manager). FBI Director Hoover was probably so compromised by the Mafia due to his heavy gambling, socializing with Mafia and Mafia-related people, as well as his alleged homosexuality, that he denied the existence of the Mafia until 1957. Even after Senator Kefauver’s Commission on Organized Crime convincingly concluded that a powerful and dangerous organized crime network existed, Hoover continued to deny their existence, and actually cut funds for investigations involving the “top hoodlums program.”4 Since the FBI controlled the Warren Commission investigation, Hoover appears to have been protecting his career, the reputation of the FBI, his friend Lyndon Johnson, elements of the Mafia, the CIA, Clint Murchison, and Allen Dulles, among others. The Warren Commission avoided pursuing Jack Ruby’s obvious ties to organized crime, and ignored his insistence to Chief Justice Warren that he be removed from Dallas, so he could speak more freely. Ruby’s early ties to Al Capone, Lewis McWillie, Santos Trafficante, Carlos Marcello, Joe Civello and Jimmy Hoffa have been well documented. Warren Commission attorney Burt Griffin, assigned to examine Jack Ruby, has expressed frustration that relevant documents on Ruby were withheld. Ruby’s phone calls prior to the assassination, in September 1963, reveal that the he was in touch with his old associate Lewis McWillie, Santos Trafficante’s casino contact from the Havana days. In early October, Ruby called a number listed to the ex-wife of Russell Matthews, another Trafficante associate from the same period. Late in October Ruby called Irwin Weiner, a Mafia bondsman who worked closely with Jimmy Hoffa, Sam Giancana and Santos Trafficante. In early November, Ruby received a call from “Barney” Baker, Hoffa’s strong-arm man. The next day Ruby called Hoffa lieutenants “Dusty” Miller and “Barney” Baker. Then Ruby called Nofio Pecora, a lieutenant for Carlos Marcello.5", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:309:f92fe1664e72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 603, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 310, "text": "the Havana days.

Then Ruby called Nofio Pecora, a lieutenant for Carlos Marcello.5 Jack Ruby was about $40, 000 in debt to the IRS, yet on November 19, 1963, Ruby told his tax lawyer he had a “connection” who could settle his debts.6 Three hours after President Kennedy’s death Ruby brought $7, 000 to his bank. The HSCA concluded that in Jack Ruby, those with the motive and means to commit the murder, “had knowledge of a man who had exhibited a violent nature and who was in serious financial trouble.”7 Ruby’s ongoing courtship of the Dallas Police afforded him access into the police station, and enabled him to be present for the press conference at 10 pM on the night of the assassination. Although Ruby tried to pass himself off as a translator for the Israeli press, no one believed him or seemed to care. Just prior to the presenting of Oswald to the press, Ruby persuaded the Dallas Police to page KLIF radio reporter Joe Delong. At the press conference Ruby helped Dallas D.A. Henry Wade (a former FBI agent) on a question regarding Oswald’s background. When Wade was asked, “Do you have anything to indicate why the man killed the President, if he did so? He replied, “Well, he was a member of the movement – the Free Cuba Movement.” Ruby somehow knowledgeably corrected him and chimed in by saying it was the “Fair Play for Cuba Movement.” Jarnagin, entertainer Bill DeMar and Madeline Brown all say they saw them together the week before the assassination. Jack Ruby’s mechanic Bill Chester stated that he saw Oswald in Ruby’s car. Jesse Ventura writes about Oswald’s friend Judyth Vary Baker: “Jack Ruby visited David Ferrie’s apartment on the day when Judyth and Lee were there. Ferrie introduced him to Judyth as Sparky Rubenstein. Ruby recognized Lee, and said that he used to see him at parties.”8 After the press conference Ruby called station KLIF and offered to bring over some sandwiches. Before delivering food to KLIF he set up two interviews for KLIF reporters with Henry Wade. Notably, Gordon McLendon then owned KLIF, and his media network cooperated regularly with the CIA. By 1 am, Ruby left to go to the Dallas Times Herald, ostensibly to revise his club ads.10 When Ruby was arrested after shooting Oswald, he shouted that he wanted McLendon’s help.

Lyndon Johnson stood to be embarrassed because of the actions of his top Senate aide, “one of my most trusted friends,” Bobby Baker. Baker, who was convicted of tax evasion, fraud, and theft, had done considerable business with Carlos Marcello. Johnson once told House Speaker John McCormack, in the presence of Washington lobbyist Robert Winterberger, that he believed Baker had it in his power to ruin him.11 The Kennedy Justice Department and the IRS were examining the skim from Las Vegas casinos which impacted Bobby Baker’s investment partners Ed Levinson, an old Meyer Lansky ally, and Ben Siegelbaum (Bugsy Siegal), a Hoffa ally.12 When Johnson was Senate Majority Leader he had appeared as one of Cleveland mobster Moe Dalitz’s guests of honor at the opening of the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Johnson had also allegedly siphoned a percentage of Marcello’s gambling profits in Texas in the 1950s, states Ramparts reporter Michael Dorman in his book Payoff. According to Dorman, Johnson, because of his dependence on Halfen-Marcello money, had helped kill all anti-racketeering legislation proposals that could have affected Marcello’s businesses.13 A former Justice Department official told author John Davis that at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy there was a thick investigative file on Robert Kennedy’s desk detailing the Marcello-Halfen-Johnson connection. The Attorney General was debating whether to pursue these leads. This would have helped the Kennedy brothers’ behind-the-scene efforts to discredit Johnson and contribute to Johnson not seeking re-election. This file also seems to have disappeared. Author Gus Russo asserts that RFK helped supply information to Dorman.14 Another example of the difficulties in clarifying this gray alliance is analysis of the events surrounding Oswald’s arrest in New Orleans. David Schiem, in Contract on America, concludes that the Mafia killed Kennedy. He notes that when Oswald was arrested for a scuffle on the streets of New Orleans on August 9, 1963, he was bailed out of jail by Emil Bruneau, who was an associate of Nofia Pecora, one of Godfather Carlos Marcello’s most trusted aides. The night after he was released, Oswald was visited by his uncle, “Dutz” Murret, a Mafia numbers runner. Schiem, however, omits the role of Special Agent John Quigley of the FBI who met with Oswald while in jail. Oswald asked to see Quigley, and was separated from the others who were arrested; he talked with Quigley, who later burned the notes he took during this interview. Schiem’s views have evolved to include CIA-mafia cooperation.

Schiem’s views have evolved to include CIA-mafia cooperation. Garrison, on the other hand, fails to mention Oswald’s dealings with Bruneau and Murret. Garrison determined that when the Mafia has worked with the U.S. intelligence agencies, they have done so as a junior partner; and the Mafia could not have controlled the cover-up. Carlos Marcello claimed to two associates while in prison that “yeah I had the son of a bitch killed. I’m glad I did it.” The HSCA concluded that Marcello and Trafficante had the “motive, means, and opportunity to assassinate President Kennedy.” The Kennedys’ war on crime infuriated Marcello, who had been deported to Guatemala, and then illegally reentered the country; he faced: an $850, 000 tax assessment; indictment for illegal reentry; new McClellan committee hearings; and an indictment for conspiracy and perjury. Marcello worked closely with Jimmy Hoffa and Santos Trafficante, two key Kennedy DOJ targets. In the fall of 1962 Marcello held a meeting with close associates and declared an Old Italian proverb “If you want to kill a dog, you don’t cut off the tail, you cut off the head.” Ed Becker, who attended the meeting, interpreted this as “if the president were killed Bobby would lose his bite.” Marcello added that he had a plan where a “nut” would take the fall. Marcello’s associate Santos Trafficante told businessman Jose Aleman that “Kennedy’s not going to make it to the election … he’s going to be hit.” Aleman was fearful in testifying before the HSCA, and now lives in virtual seclusion. The HSCA found Aleman credible, and that “Trafficante’s stature in national organized crime…and his role as the mobs chief liaison to criminal figures within the Cuban exile community, provided him with the capability of formulating an assassination conspiracy against President Kennedy.”15 Jack Ruby’s trips to Cuba in August 1959, according to the HSCA, “were an important, but minor, part of an organized crime operation, which may have had to do with Trafficante’s detention.” This is bolstered by statements from British journalist John Wilson, who was also in the Cuban immigration detention center Triscornia with Trafficante, who said Ruby frequently visited “an American gangster type named Santos.” The Kennedys threatened the secure Mafia niche. Prosecution of the Mafia dropped by about 83% after President Kennedy was assassinated. Even the cautious Chief Counsel for the HSCA, Robert Blakey, observed that the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby “had all of the earmarks of an organized crime hit.” After the HSCA Report,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:312:c811a1f432c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 606, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 313, "text": "British journalist John Wilson, who was also in the Cuban immigration detention center Triscornia with Trafficante, who said Ruby frequently visited “an American gangster type named Santos.” The Kennedys threatened the secure Mafia niche.

Even the cautious Chief Counsel for the HSCA, Robert Blakey, observed that the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby “had all of the earmarks of an organized crime hit.” After the HSCA Report, the mass media has often inferred or blamed the Mafia for the assassination without noting its ties to the FBI, the CIA, and leading politicians and justices. Media coverage, which generally separated the Mafia from the “gray alliances” they often work with, obscured the need for deeper investigation. The Mafia conveniently seems to be the third level of scapegoat – after Castro and Oswald. The CIA’s growth was likened to a malignancy, “which the very high official was not sure even the White House could control … any longer…. If the U.S. experiences (an attempt at a coup) it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.… The agency represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone. he origins of the CIA and its autonomy foreshadowed major threats to democracy. The CIA had often acted independently from the Chief Executive prior to and during JFK’s presidency. Although he still strongly supported covert actions after the Bay of Pigs failure, CIA veterans were frustrated and fearful about Kennedy’s increasing restraints on their missions, his National Security Action Memorandums 55 and 57, as well as his liberal push in foreign policy. These perceptions, along with Oswald’s links to the CIA and its contract agents, the concerted and ongoing efforts by the CIA to conceal information from numerous committees, as well as the agency’s policies to influence the mass media, indicate a significant role played by portions of the CIA in the assassination and its cover-up. The CIA connections to corporate America, the mass media, the Defense Department, and elements of the mafia, suggest a wide range of potentially cooperative elite factions. The OSS, (Office of Strategic Services), forerunner of the CIA, was headed by corporate lawyer “Wild Bill” Donovan, who had worked for the Morgan banking group early in his career. The standard joke was the OSS stood for Oh So Social, referring to the leading roles played by the Ivy League elites. OSS officers (such as industrialist Andrew Mellon’s son Paul and both sons of J.P. Morgan Jr.) worked creatively and effectively with leaders in industry, academe, and the military, without much oversight.1 After WWII, the OSS was transferred to the War Dept., renamed OSO, and worked with Army G-2 intelligence. By 1946 President Truman regretted the dismantling of the OSS, since numerous intelligence agencies gave conflicting reports, so he set about forming a Central Intelligence Agency.

By 1946 President Truman regretted the dismantling of the OSS, since numerous intelligence agencies gave conflicting reports, so he set about forming a Central Intelligence Agency. The War-Peace Studies Project of the Council on Foreign Relations had promoted a new intelligence agency, based on the OSS. This was bolstered by a report written for Navy Secretary James Forrestal by Wall Street banker Ferdinand Eberstadt. Both worked for the investment bank Dillon Read. The CIA had been shaped by Allen Dulles (CFR chair) along with the advisory group he formed, five of the six being Wall Street bankers or lawyers. In 1948 Forrestal appointed Dulles to chair a CIA oversight committee. The CIA was to report to the National Security Council (NSC), and within a year the NSC was authorizing covert operations through the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), a secret group within the CIA. In June 1948 the NSC secretly started the OPC through the State Department without congressional authorization, based on CIA successes in the April 1948 Italian election. That Italian election is worth briefly reviewing. The NSC, on 12/14/47, gave its first top secret orders to the CIA, to use “covert psychological operations to counter Soviet and Soviet inspired activities.” Before the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Committee had finished, Dulles and Forrestal met with Dulles’ ally James Angleton, the CIA’s Rome Station Chief. Angleton estimated that $10 million would be needed. Corporate leaders in Italy feared revenge if the Communists won, so to help, Forrestal and Dulles raised money from their friends on Wall St. More was needed, so Forrestal convinced Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder to access the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which held money for European reconstruction. It dispersed money to bank accounts of wealthy Americans, who sent it to Italian political groups set up by the CIA. Millions were given to Italian politicians, Catholic Action (a political arm of the Vatican) and the Christian Democrats. It worked, and Dulles pushed for the NSC to broaden the OPC powers.2 NSC Directive 10/2 permitted the overthrow of governments. The Director was selected by the State Department, the officers wore military uniforms, and they were paid by the CIA, while programming came from the State Department and the NSC. The OPC was headed by Wall Street lawyer Frank Wisner (formerly OSS), a man committed to “rollback” of communism rather than containment. He cooperated with John and Allen Dulles to protect favored Nazi generals, in order to recreate the SS underground networks in Eastern Europe, Byelorussia and Ukraine to agitate for anti-communist rebellion.

Without informing President Truman or other intelligence agencies, OPC brought leading Nazi collaborators into the U.S. Wisner and General Lewis Clay looked to Thomas Dewey’s election, which would sanction this extension of OPC operations. The Dulles brothers, key figures in the Dewey campaign, were powerful supporters of OPC’s political action programs. The Ford Foundation worked closely with Marshall Plan and CIA officials during the early years of the Cold War. Richard Bissell served as a Ford Foundation staff member in 1953, before he become a special assistant to the director of the CIA, Allen Dulles. The Ford Foundation joined with the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation and the Air Force to set up RAND Corporation, the institute most involved in classified research. In the 1950s, the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations gave a $2.5 million grant to the Council on Foreign Relations, which made it the dominant private agency in foreign relations. McGeorge Bundy, special assistant to the President for national security from 1961-1966, had worked for the CFR while at Harvard, before joining JFK’s administration. He retired to become president of the Ford Foundation from 1966- 1979, and then later became President of the Carnegie Foundation. His brother William Bundy worked for the CIA from 1951-1961. Former CIA agent Philip Agee maintained that, “Everything the CIA does in the areas of psychological warfare and covert actions benefits multinational corporations.”4 Funding for many CIA programs, from public and private sources, has been laundered through major foundations (Carnegie, Rockefeller, Whitney, and Ford) since the late 1940s. Insiders joke that CIA stands for Corporate Interests of America, or refer to it as the “Company.” Allen Dulles’ grandfather John Foster, as well as his uncle Robert Lansing, had served as Secretary of State, as did his older brother John during the Eisenhower years. Allen and John had earlier worked for the preeminent law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, which served the leading banks and corporations. Sullivan and Cromwell engineered the Panamanian independence movement to break away from Colombia in order to assist their French construction clients building the Panama Canal. Sullivan and Cromwell merged politics and global business.

The Dulles’ actively arranged large loans and investments with the growing Nazi regime, a source of profits and perceived as a bulwark against communism. Sullivan and Cromwell floated the first American bonds issued by German arms manufacturers Krupp A.G., extended I.G. Farben’s global reach, and opened Canadian trade to German arms manufactures.5 Dulles’ patrician style, along with his education, business, and OSS experience, generated confidence in the mainstream media, and in Congress. Dulles’ penchant for rogue operations can be seen with his OSS actions to disregard Roosevelt’s policy of unconditional surrender. He secretly negotiated with Nazi generals “Operation Sunrise” to co-opt their intelligence system and turn it against the Soviets. In late 1945 James Angleton arranged an unauthorized meeting between his mentor, Dulles, and then continued to develop safe escapes, “ratlines,” for some Nazi war criminals to relocate in Latin America or the U.S., while other U.S. intelligence agencies hunted them. Meanwhile Dulles pressed for a global network of CIA stations and that “covert operations be increased in intensity and number.” “The Great White Case Officer” as he came to be called, valued zeal in his subordinates. Dulles wrote, ‘We are not really at peace with them, [the Soviet bloc] and we have not been since Communism declared its own war on our system of government and life.” CIA officers spoke of waging a Cold War, with the emphasis on war.6 Allen Dulles’ work to get Eisenhower elected aided his advancement to Director of the CIA in 1953. No longer would intelligence just support military action, run propaganda and influence elections – they would overthrow governments, plot the assassination of foreign leaders, prepare death lists, expand propaganda (Operation Mockingbird), and advance the agents implementing these programs. By 1956, President Eisenhower suspected that the CIA was out of control and established a review led by David Bruce and Robert Lovett, pillars of the Eastern Establishment. They were concerned that the CIA had become engaged in unaccountable covert actions where sometimes the U.S. Ambassador in a country was unaware of CIA actions. This led to the President’s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities which echoed the deep concerns of the Bruce-Lovett Report. Their review of clandestine services concluded that they were “operating for the most part on an autonomous and free-wheeling basis in highly critical areas.” It recommended that Eisenhower either fire Allen Dulles or force him to accept an assistant.

This was a method of operation, which became the basis of many of the political action adventures of the 1960s and 1970s in many instances; we made the action programs up ourselves after we had collected enough intelligence to make them appear required by circumstance. Our activity in Indonesia in 1957-1958 was one such instance.… The most efficient way to handle ambassadors who demanded their rights as heads of U.S. missions abroad to be informed of CIA operational activities was to tell them plausible lies.”8 President Kennedy inherited a CIA that had widely interpreted its 1947 National Security Act clause to perform “such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct.” This clause had become the wedge for covert actions which included: running counterinsurgency wars in China, Greece, The Philippines, Albania, Korea, Laos, Peru, and Vietnam; organizing coup d’états in Iran, Iraq, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Syria, and the Congo; influencing elections in Italy, Costa Rica, The CIA under Dulles strengthened the network of national security at the expense of democracy. Journalist David Halberstam noted, “…This was not just an isolated phenomenon but part of something larger going on in Washington – the transition from an isolationist America to imperial colossus. A true democracy had no need for a vast, secret security apparatus, but an imperial state did… what was evolving was a closed state within an open state.” Nelson Rockefeller, along with Hoover’s FBI, ran U.S. intelligence in Latin America during WWII. Rockefeller’s associate in Brazil, Colonel J.C. King, became CIA Chief of Clandestine activities in the Western Hemisphere.

Dean Rusk went from the State Department to the presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation 1952-1960, and then became Secretary of State for Kennedy and Johnson. John Foster Dulles was a trustee at the Rockefeller Foundation at the same time he was chairman at the Carnegie Foundation, just before he became Eisenhower’s secretary of state, (“Philanthropists at War”). CIA programs often targeted democratic socialists in partisan politics, and even church social reformers and union organizing. U.S. multinationals helped support the CIA-funded American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) which organized against socialist, liberal, and communist unions in Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s. President Kennedy inherited other networks of interests. In 1949 the Shah of Iran brought in “Overseas Consultants” to give technical and economic advice; the legal spokesman was Allen Dulles. Dulles had long worked with the London-based Schroder bank, which had large holdings in the Anglo-American Oil Company as well as major U.S. oil companies. The Shah moved slowly to implement changes and was defeated in a free election by a democratic socialist Dr. Mossedegh, who moved to nationalize the oil industry.10 In 1953 the CIA along with British intelligence overthrew Mossedegh, and they returned Shah Palevi to power, a leader who would not threaten the U.S. and British oil interests. The Dulles brothers convinced a reluctant Eisenhower to intervene by arguing that Iran was part of a Cold War struggle rather than one of nationalism. Allen Dulles warned the NSC that if Iran fell into Communism, that 60% of the free world’s oil would be in the hands of the Soviet Union. Mossedegh was portrayed as a Soviet pawn rather than the educated, wealthy, proud nationalist that he was. In 1954, the CIA overthrew the democratically elected liberal leader of Guatemala, Jacob Arbenz, thereby protecting the interests of the United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers also worked for Sullivan and Cromwell after doing legal work for the Schroder Bank, and were the key financial advisors for the rail lines in Guatemala. In 1936, John Foster Dulles, as counsel for Schroder Bank, negotiated a deal with United Fruit Company. Allen Dulles, who often helped his brother with Schroder Bank matters, soon was appointed to the Board of Directors. The Schroder Bank was a depository of secret CIA funds for covert operations.11 John Moors Cabot, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-America Affairs owned stock in United Fruit, and his brother had served as president of the corporation.

UN Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge was a stockholder too. State Department policies during 1954 complemented that of the CIA. In Guatemala these policies were preceded by a two-year P.R. campaign by Edward Bernays, a propaganda expert hired by the United Fruit Company, who systematically influenced the major U.S. media on the dangers of President Arbenz. Junkets to Guatemala seemingly influenced reports from Time, Newsweek, Scripps-Howard, U.S. News, the New York Times, the Miami Herald and others. United Fruit’s director referred to “a public relations coup” which promoted the pretense that the U.S. was not involved. Bernays commented, “It is difficult to make a convincing case for manipulation of the press when the victims proved so eager for the experience.”12 The project officer for the CIA on the Guatemalan Coup (codenamed PBSUCESS) was Tracey Barnes. Barnes worked with David Phillips and Howard Hunt and other CIA field staff on a range of projects including assassinations of Arbenz supporters which would be blamed on surrogates. The CIA had an assassination manual developed for the coup. By 1954, CIA General Counsel Larry Houston had developed an arrangement with the Justice Dept. so that CIA crimes of murder would not be prosecuted.13 At a PBSUCESS staff meeting in 1954 discussions included a list of 15-20 Guatemalan leaders who could be killed by gunmen sent by Trujillo (Dominican Republic). Subsequent assassination plans were not recorded in writing,14 thus broadening a culture of deniability. The Schroder Banking Corporation and the Schroder Trust functioned as prime depositories for CIA monies through the 1950s and 1960s, similar to B.C.C.I. in the 1980s. These German firms also facilitated Hitler’s rise to power. Clients of Sullivan and Cromwell, served by Allen Dulles, sat on both Boards of Directors.15 Former CIA director Richard Helms later noted, “Hell, the agency sloshed money all over the world.” The Schroder Bank became the major funding source for PERMINDEX, one of whose initial directors was Clay Shaw. PERMINDEX was modeled after the New Orleans International Trade Mart directed by Clay Shaw. A State Department cable of 11/7/58: It appears that PERMINDEX has formed an affiliate called the Rome World Trade Center (Centro Mondale Commerciale de Roma).… An American, Mr. Clay Shaw Managing Director of the International Trade Mart has been named to the Board of Directors of the Roman affiliate which the news reporter said, has been incorporated with a capital stock of 100 million lire.… The Trade Mart is said to have furnished the model on which PERMINDEX bases itself.

During the Kennedy Administration he actively opposed Kennedy’s low interest rate polices. Allen Dulles responded to a memo by Colonel J. C. King to set up Operation 40, a Cuban Task Force to remove Castro, headed by Richard Nixon and senior CIA officers Ted Shakley, David Phillips, E. Howard Hunt, Henry Hecksher, Tom Clines, William Harvey, Carl Jenkins, David Morales, Admiral Arleigh Burke and others. The committee also consisted of a number of CIA assets including Frank Sturgis, Felix Rodriquez, Gerry Hemming, Edwin Wilson, William Pawley, Antonio Veciana, Tony Cuesta, Eladio Del Valle, Carlos Bringuier, Rolando Mansfer, Luis Sanjenis, ChiChi Quintero, Eugenio Martinez, Rip Robertson, Hermino Diaz Garcia, Virgilio Gonzalez, and John Martino among others. A number of sources have asserted that Operation 40 was redirected at President Kennedy. John Martino told Miami Newsday reporter John Cummings that two members of Operation 40, Hermino Diaz Garcia and Virgilio Gonzalez, were gunman in the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Martino claimed that his role was delivering money and facilitating things. HSCA staffer Fred Classen suggested that Oswald did not know who he was working for – “the anti-Castro people put him together.” Author and reporter Anthony Summers interviewed Martino’s wife, Florence, who reluctantly revealed that her husband said, “They are going to kill him [ JFK] when he gets to Texas.”18 Military intelligence operative ( Air Force OSI and Army CID) Gene Wheaton, who also worked with CIA on Cuban projects, revealed statements to the ARRB Chief Investigator Anne Buttimer, 7/12/95. Wheaton stated that senior CIA officer Carl Jenkins was involved in paramilitary activities for the Bay of Pigs and AM/WORLD (a covert anti-Castro insurgency), and along with Chi Chi Quintero (trained by David Morales) was involved in Operation 40. Jenkins claimed that he trained the Cubans that killed Kennedy. Author Larry Hancock noted in Someone Would Have Talked that Wheaton told Buttimer that Cuban exiles killed Kennedy because he was a “traitor” and that “people above the Cubans wanted Kennedy killed for different reasons.” Further ARRB meetings with Wheaton were somehow not pursued.

According to Fabian Escalante, a senior officer in the Cuban Department of State Security (G-2) businessmen George H.W. Bush and Jack Crichton were recruited to raise money for Operation 40. Escalante pointed to Operation 40 as being responsible for the assassination.19 George H.W. Bush would later head the CIA, from 1976 to 1977. On a major matter of intelligence gathering by national technical means, elements of the CIA and Defense Department disobeyed orders from the Commander in Chief. Eisenhower had explicitly ordered the U-2 spy flights to be suspended by May 1, 1960, so as not to interfere with the upcoming summit meeting with Khrushchev, de Gaulle and Macmillan. Yet the U-2 flights continued. CIA Deputy Director Richard Bissell had developed and run the U-2 program for the CIA, and almost certainly ordered the Gary Powers flight. “Powers came down because his aircraft was fixed to fail,” according to retired Air Force Colonel Fletcher Prouty, who was in charge of providing military support for the clandestine services. He argues that Powers had a shortage of proper fuel, he was laden with identification including a DOD I.D. card, and the U-2 bore identifying marks, violating NSC edicts. This catastrophe seemed timed to scuttle the May 16th summit that Eisenhower had hoped would thaw the Cold War.20 During the presidential campaign in 1960 Kennedy repeatedly declared his commitment to nationalism in Africa. Notably, just prior to his inauguration, CIA station chief in Leopoldville, Congo, Lawrence Devlin spoke of the “need to take drastic steps before it was too late.” The CIA arranged for the charismatic nationalist Patrice Lumumba to be quickly assassinated by Belgian collaborators just three days before JFK took office. When Kennedy was informed by phone of Lumumba’s assassination, a photo shows him deeply distraught.22 Soon after becoming president, Kennedy confronted a confusing situation in Laos. Laotian communists were temporarily aligned with neutralist forces in a struggle against conservative elements, led by General Phoumi Nosavan, actively supported by the CIA. North Vietnam had a small force fighting with the Pathet Lao, the Soviets had given economic assistance, and Chinese involvement was considered a possibility. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and elements of the CIA and State Department supported military intervention. The Joint Chiefs even argued that the U.S. had to be willing to use nuclear weapons if necessary. Kennedy rejected these recommendations to commit forces to Laos in order to preserve the existing right-wing government, and chose to develop a neutralist coalition.

The Joint Chiefs even argued that the U.S. had to be willing to use nuclear weapons if necessary. Kennedy rejected these recommendations to commit forces to Laos in order to preserve the existing right-wing government, and chose to develop a neutralist coalition. At his first press conference in January of 1961, Kennedy stated that Laos should be an independent country, free of domination of either side.23 In the early 1960s, a close friend of PERMINDEX director Ference Nagy, Albert Soustelle, the former Governor General of Algeria in the 1950s, met with CIA officials including Richard Bissell, then Deputy Director of Plans. According to the New York Times, Soustelle convinced the CIA that “Algeria would become, through de Gaulle’s blundering, a Soviet base.” In June 1975, the Chicago Tribune revealed portions of the Church Committee findings: “Congressional leaders have been told of the CIA involvement in a plot by French dissidents to assassinate the late French President Charles de Gaulle.”24 Early in his administration Kennedy also confronted the Bay of Pigs invasion plan. Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, CIA Director Allen Dulles, and General Richard Bissel, Deputy Director of Plans at the CIA, had created the project. Kennedy, like Eisenhower, was largely kept in the dark about this operation. Recent research indicates that Bissell altered the amphibious assault plans of Marine Corps Col. Jack Hawkins. Hawkins told Bissell that without strong air support approved in advance the invasion should not proceed. The other main planner for the amphibious assault, CIA officer, Jake Easterline, was banned from all high-level meetings. Both Hawkins and Easterline threatened to resign if the air attacks were not guaranteed.25 After the failed invasion, Kennedy cited the following arguments made by his briefers to get his approval: that there was widespread discontent in Cuba, that the anti-Castro Cubans were well-trained and ready, that both seasonal concerns and increasing military aid to Cuba made it a now-ornever proposition; that the anti-Castro force would be hard to handle if it was not allowed to proceed, that the force could escape to fight a guerrilla war if the invasion did not go well initially.26 These evaluations were wrong, and debate no longer exists as to whether these intelligence failures were honest mistakes or a strategy. An attempt was made to manipulate the president into a situation where he needed either to use military force in Cuba, or lose. Kennedy, however, refused to commit U.S. forces despite the pleas of the CIA, the Pentagon, and most of his top advisors, such as McGeorge Bundy and Dean Rusk.

Notably, Bundy was a former student and later a colleague of Bissell at Yale and had worked with Dulles since the Dewey campaign in 1948. JFK was furious with the CIA and Joint Chiefs of Staff and threatened to “shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces.” After an investigation into the failure, Kennedy waited a few months before firing Dulles, Bissell, and Cabell. He appointed an outsider, a corporate Republican, John McCone, to run the CIA. Realizing the challenges McCone would confront, he tasked his brother Bobby to help McCone control the agency. Some sources now show that top CIA officers continued to regularly visit Dulles at his home in Georgetown after he was fired.27 Kennedy confronted a CIA hierarchy accustomed to autonomy and filled with the hubris of power. Born to privilege, nurtured by the Ivy League and WWII intelligence, they rationalized that the necessities of the Cold War required often making rather than following laws. These zealots were emboldened by significant elements of the military and intelligence leadership. They sometimes referred to themselves as “Bold Easterners,” while critics like Director of Central Intelligence executive assistant Victor Marchetti saw them as a “Cult of Intelligence.” William Colby, DCI in the early 1970’s, called the early CIA “an order of Knights Templar, out to save western freedom from Communist darkness”28 DCI Allen Dulles had long been used to developing foreign policy with his brother John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State for Eisenhower. At a dinner party in Walter Lippmann’s house Dulles boasted that he was still carrying out the foreign policy of his brother. When informed the next day by Kennedy confidante Bill Walton, the president was furious.29 James Jesus Angleton, longtime director of CIA Counterintelligence, was similarly raised to privilege and power. An Ivy League poet who served in the OSS, his connections and attitudes helped create the cluster of “Bold Easterners.” He was the “Gray Ghost” to his colleagues – thin, clever, dedicated and suspicious. With Allen Dulles as his mentor, he quickly carved out his own autonomous agency within an autonomous agency. In 1954 Angleton convinced Eisenhower and Army General James Doolittle that the CIA needed a counterintelligence staff knowledgeable about the KGB methods to oversee CIA covert operations and resist Soviet penetration of the U.S. government. Angleton saw Kennedy as faltering during the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. “Kennedy should have forced Castro from Cuba for having conspired with the Kremlin to bring Soviet missile power into the western hemisphere.” Angleton", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:323:d3629040df59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 617, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 324, "text": "own autonomous agency within an autonomous agency.

Angleton saw Kennedy as faltering during the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. “Kennedy should have forced Castro from Cuba for having conspired with the Kremlin to bring Soviet missile power into the western hemisphere.” Angleton then tried to shape Cuba policy with his “Cuban Control and Action Capabilities,” which he distributed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and 15 other agencies. Years later he remained a legend in his own mind as seen by his responses to Senator Church’s Intelligence Committee (1975). Angleton, who had drifted into alcohol, admitted to not informing President Kennedy of some CIA actions and misinforming him of others. Notably, he declared that, “it’s inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all of the overt orders of the government.”30 Years later, retired and in failing health Angleton divulged to reporter Joe Trento: Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you were to be promoted.… Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power.… [Trento asked how Angleton got appointed to run counterintelligence.] I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dulles and 60 of his closest friends, they were afraid that their own business dealings with Hitler’s pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it all.… There was no accountability, and without real accountability everything turned to shit. 31 Allen Dulles gave a remarkable range of powers to his close friend James Angleton, who served as the CIA liaison to the FBI. As chief of counter-intelligence he spied on the CIA, he ran assets in other agencies. His close bond with Dulles lasted long after Dulles was fired by Kennedy. Angleton included Dulles in his will and he carried Dulles’ ashes after he died. Angleton chose to create an Office of Security file (OS file) rather than a 201 file, so that he could more closely control it. Perhaps Angleton was determining if a Soviet mole in the CIA was interested in him. He made his close associate Ray Rocco the official CIA liaison to the Warren Commission and he knew what to cover up after the Warren Commission ended.32 Recall that Angleton ran a completely “independent group of journalist-operatives who performed sensitive and frequently dangerous assignments; little is known of this group for the simple reason that Angleton kept only the vaguest of files.” One media asset was former Nazi war criminal Paul Hoffman, who got his job with The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:324:7bf089c3917d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 618, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 325, "text": "in him.

Born of affluence, Helms was educated in Switzerland with the future Shah of Iran. A former UPI correspondent, he viewed McCone as a front man “straight from central casting.” Helms bitterly resented RFK’s oversight and their distrust was deep and mutual.34 After Kennedy dismissed Dulles, debates raged regarding his successor. McCone a Republican industrialist and former AEC chairman, was not the CIA’s first choice – yet he remained more in line with the CIA old guard than with the New Frontier. Dulles indeed, continued to meet regularly with retired and active CIA officers at his Washington home. Those meetings included Frank Wisner, Charles Cabell, James Angleton, Richard Helms, Cord Meyer, Desmond FitzGerald, Howard Hunt, James Hunt, and Thomas Karamersines as well as John McCone.35 In the newly independent Congo in 1960, CIA surrogates assassinated the charismatic nationalist Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who had often expressed a passion for neutralism, a week before Kennedy took office. Eisenhower declared that Lumumba was a Soviet accomplice who should “fall into a river of crocodiles.” Dulles directed the Congo’s CIA station Chief Lawrence Devlin to make it happen. To reassert control of the Belgian-supported province, the CIA station chief in Congo, Lawrence Devlin, had “direct influence over the events that led to Lumumba’s death,” according to Stephen Weismann in Foreign Affairs, “What Really Happened in Congo.”36 (Based on recently declassified files from the Church Committee, a Belgian parliamentary investigation and U.S. State Department research, Newman, John p.266-269). A secessionist faction, led by Moesha Tshombe, president of mineral rich Katanga province, had the support of financial and mining interests in Belgium, France, Great Britain, and factions in the U.S. In the struggle between “nationalism and colonialism” according to Kennedy advisor Chester Bowles, the Joint Chiefs, the Defense Department and the European Bureau of the State Department favored “spheres of influence (for) former colonial rulers,” the largest CIA covert actions in their history, supported Britain, France and Belgium when Kennedy took office .

Kennedy, however, supported the anti-colonial U.N. efforts, including the use of military forces to prevent the break-up of the Congo.37 Congolese civil war. Forman President Truman declared to the N.Y. Times 9/20/61 that “Dag Hammarskjold was on the point of getting something done when they killed him.” CIA operative Roland Culligan admitted involvement in the assassination to the Church Commission. Confusion lingers regarding CIA involvement. Years later, the South African Truth Commission chairman, Desmond Tutu, released letters from the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), said to be a front for the South African military,which include references to the CIA and British MI5. “In a meeting between MI5, special ops executive and the SAIMR, the following emerged, reads one document marked Top Secret, “it is felt that Hammarskjold should be removed … I want his removal to be handled more efficiently than was Patrice.” Another letter headed “Operation Celeste” detailed orders to plant in the wheel bay of an aircraft, explosives primed to go off as the wheels were retracted on takeoff. The Reuters report, 8/20/98, included the predictable CIA denial of involvement.38 This power struggle is indicative of a pattern of CIA defiance of the chain of command. The CIA had bypassed the State Department in nation after nation. Kennedy tried to change this by sending Chester Bowles on a trip around the world to clarify the supremacy of ambassadors in their embassies; however, a 1963 Senate report concluded that the Kennedy order had become “a shadow.” It also noted, “To a degree the primacy of the ambassador is a polite fiction.”39 Frustration with the CIA in Vietnam led to press leaks. Scripps-Howard reporter Richard Starnes, 10/2/63 , wrote “Spooks make life miserable for Ambassador Lodge.” According to a highly placed source, the CIA “twice flatly refused to carry out instructions from Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. An American field officer declared that a Colonel at headquarters is a CIA agent and his role is unclear “unless he is spying on Americans.” Military officers “scream over the way the spooks dabble in military operations.” The source then speculated on the possibility of a coup and the CIA being involved By 1962 JFK had directed his brother Robert to manage the CIA’s Cuban policies, as well as oversee the agency. “Operation Mongoose” started in late 1961, used terror, crop burnings,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:326:72e92d054d50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 620, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 327, "text": "field officer declared that a Colonel at headquarters is a CIA agent and his role is unclear “unless he is spying on Americans.” Military officers “scream over the way the spooks dabble in military operations.” The source then speculated on the possibility of a coup and the CIA being involved By 1962 JFK had directed his brother Robert to manage the CIA’s Cuban policies, as well as oversee the agency. “Operation Mongoose” started in late 1961, used terror, crop burnings, destruction of Cuban power and water systems, and attacks on Soviet ships. The ambitious and uncoordinated plan spun off assassination plots with the mafia as well as major military exercises, simulating an attack on an island, “Operation Swift Strike II,” and “Ortsac” (Castro backwards). RFK’s point man, General Edward Geary Lansdale, attempted to circumvent the CIA elite, as seen by a memo to RFK suggesting they go around Bissell and “the CIA palace guard,” and work with a mid-level CIA official. CIA elites loathed Lansdale’s influence on Cuban policy. CIA agent Bill Harvey, who headed the Miami-based Cuba operations, viewed “Operation Mongoose as mostly for show,”40 and saw the Kennedys as cowards. Harvey hated RFK and saw Lansdale as “a screwball.” Respected CIA officer John Whitten saw Harvey as a “thug,” in part because one of Harvey’s best friends was Mafioso Johnny Roselli. HSCA staffers found Harvey to be heavily involved with mafia figures, and out of control, although some historians argue that Helms ordered Harvey to resume assassination plans with the mafia against Castro. CIA contract agent Joe Shimon viewed Harvey as always working for James Angleton.41 Back in 1959, Harvey was one of three CIA officers privy to plans to send false defectors into the Soviet Union, and almost certainly knew of Oswald. Lansdale and Helms contributed to Soviet fears in Cuba. When the HSCA general counsel asked Whitten how he interpreted Harvey’s wife burning his private papers after his death, Whitten retorted, “He was too young to have assassinated McKinley and Lincoln. It could have been anything.”42 CIA defiance and mixed signals emerged after the Cuban Missile Crisis as well. Kennedy aide Ted Sorenson asserted that the President told his brother to stop the anti-Cuban operations after the Cuban missile crisis, and was assured that this would occur. Historian Thomas Patterson, however, argued that after October 1962, “raids by (Cuban) exiles, some of them no doubt perpetrated with CIA collaboration, and most of them monitored but not stopped by American authorities, remained a menace.” Kennedy pursued a dual-track policy of “The plan for a coup in Cuba,” as well as diplomacy; however, CIA covert actions had grown beyond the control of the chief executive, Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) McCone, and the Attorney General.

According to the CIA inspector general in a report in 1967, Richard Helms gave Desmond FitzGerald the approval for AMLASH, the plan to assassinate Castro. He stated “it was not necessary to seek approval from Robert Kennedy for FitzGerald to speak in his name.”43 I think it has become necessary to take another look at the purpose and operations of our CIA.… For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy making arm of the government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas. I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations… I would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President… CIA links with Lee Harvey Oswald appear ubiquitous. Oswald was: 1) stationed at Atsugi, Japan, from which the CIA made its U-2 flights, he had a “Crypto” clearance – higher than “Top Secret.” Sergeant Gerry Patrick Hemming, who served in Japan with Oswald, and was later recruited by the CIA for action’s with anti-Castro Cubans, says he believed that Oswald was recruited then by the CIA based on conversations with him. 2) Recruited by the CIA, according to CIA finance Officer James Wilcott, for his assignment in the USSR – in 1959 CIA Counterintelligence opened a 201 file on him. Senator Richard Schweiker, a member of the Senate Intelligence committee flatly stated in 2007 that Oswald “was the product of a fake defector program run by the CIA.” Oswald’s “defection” was approved by Richard Snyder, a Foreign Service Officer, who was probably working for the CIA at the American Embassy in Moscow; ⁴⁴3 ) He was met upon return to the U.S. by Spas Raikin and representatives of the CIA-funded American Friends of Anti-Bolshevik Bloc Nations; 4) befriended by CIA Contract Division Agent George de Mohrenschildt in Dallas and Ft. Worth; 5) in contact with highly-paid CIA Contract Agent Clay Shaw as well as Contract Agent David Ferrie and CIA asset Jack Martin in New Orleans; 6) worked at the William Reily Coffee Co. – Reily was assigned CIA number EE-334.45 7) In contact with CIA Contract Agent Marita Lorenz in Miami; 8) met once with CIA and military intelligence asset Antonio Veciana and CIA agent David Phillips; and 9) encountered agents or operatives with the Cuban Student Directorate (DRE),", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:328:c1e489dad2dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 622, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 329, "text": "Worth; 5) in contact with highly-paid CIA Contract Agent Clay Shaw as well as Contract Agent David Ferrie and CIA asset Jack Martin in New Orleans; 6) worked at the William Reily Coffee Co. – Reily was assigned CIA number EE-334.45 7) In contact with CIA Contract Agent Marita Lorenz in Miami; 8) met once with CIA and military intelligence asset Antonio Veciana and CIA agent David Phillips; and 9) encountered agents or operatives with the Cuban Student Directorate (DRE), which was supported by CIA officers George Joannides, and David Phillips. The CIA followed Oswald closely the last month of his life, particularly from the offices of James Angleton and David Phillips. Former CIA Director Allen Dulles, fired by President Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs failure, was the most active member of the Warren Commission, and found no links between Oswald and any intelligence agency. Recall that after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy also fired CIA Director of Plans General Charles Cabell, whose brother Earle was then the Mayor of Dallas, and assisted in the rerouting of the Presidential motorcade. According to Dallas Deputy Sheriff Carson, Mayor Cabell, who we now know was a CIA asset, ordered the unusual transfer of Oswald to county facilities. Their father also had been the Dallas Chief of Police. Charles Cabell had been Dulles’ deputy for nine years. He had also been E. Howard Hunt’s coordinating superior on the CIA Guatemalan operation. When Charles Cabell spoke to the New Orleans Foreign Policy Association in May 1961, he was introduced by Clay Shaw.46 The Warren Commission, however, never interviewed General Cabell. Richard Bissell, who directed the “Executive Action” branch of the CIA, which had the capacity to assassinate foreign leaders, was also fired. Kennedy cut the CIA budget in 1962 and 1963 and was aiming to cut 20% by 1966.47 Oswald’s best friend in Dallas, George de Mohrenschildt, was a CIA contract agent working with J. Walton Moore. De Mohrenschildt’s, the scion of a powerful oil family in Russia, worked with the OSS as had his brother Dmitri. George helped Oswald get a job at Jaggers Childs and Stovall, a photographic company with secret military security clearance to process maps and photos. Oswald worked with Guy Banister ex-ONI, in New Orleans. Banister’s office was frequented by CIA and mafia-connected David Ferrie as well as Clay Shaw. Banister’s files, which were either “routinely destroyed” by the Louisiana State Police, or taken by the FBI, remains a mystery. Banister’s index, which survived, included files categories of on the CIA, Ammunition and Arms, Anti-Soviet Underground, B-70 Manned Bomber Force, U.S. Civil Rights, Dismantling of Ballistic Missile System, Dismantling of U.S. Defenses, Fair Play for Cuba Committee and Clay Shaw’s International Trade Mart.48 Aspects of the CIA role with the Warren Commission can be seen regarding Marina Oswald.

Seemingly, the CIA coached Marina Oswald prior to her first testimony before the Warren Commission. A Warren Commission counsel wrote in a memo, 2/28/64, “Marina has repeatedly lied … on matters which are of vital concern.” After the assassination Jack Crichton, former OSS man, Army Intelligence operative and wealthy Dallas oilman, voluntarily worked with Marina Oswald.49 Crichton also contacted the Dallas Police to bring in Ilya Mamantov as a translator for Marina Oswald. Mamantov, a vocal anti-communist, tried to establish that Oswald had ties to Cuba and that “leftist” Oswald had acted alone. School Book Depository building. Crichton started and commanded the 488th Military Intelligence Detachment, with forty or fifty of the approximately 100-man force being members of the Dallas Police Department. Crichton, the Texas GOP candidate for governor in 1964, was close friends with George de Mohrenschildt and George H.W. Bush.50 Former CIA employee Isaac Don Levine spent an intensive week with Marina just prior to her first testimony before the Warren Commission, under the pretext of writing a book about her. Levine in 1951 had served on the CIA-directed board of American Liberation Committee and was its European director, where he worked closely with Allen Dulles, C.D. Jackson, and John McCloy.51 Levine emphasized the claim that Marina and Marguerite Oswald willfully destroyed a copy of “the backyard photo” (the purported picture of Oswald with the alleged murder weapon Mannlicher-Carcano) that would have clinched the case against Oswald as the assassin. What emerged before the Warren Commission was a contrived story of Marina concealing the picture in her shoe while visiting Lee in jail and, later that night, destroying it at Marguerite’s insistence.52 Levine may have played a role in Marina’s late recalling of the “Nixon incident” – Oswald’s alleged announced intentions to assassinate Nixon in the spring of 1963. Marina supposedly locked Lee in the bathroom to prevent him from carrying out the assault. When Chief Counsel Rankin asked Levine how, he creatively claimed, “You take a broomstick and put it through the handle and lock the door. Russians know how to do this better than anyone else.” Levine later claimed Oswald also planned to go to Russia to assassinate Khrushchev.53 Attorney William A. McKenzie, who had previously represented George de Mohrenschildt as well as Clint Murchison’s Great Southwest Corporation, also advised Marina.

The Warren Commission failed to pursue unsolicited sworn testimony that McKenzie had improperly coached Marina on what to tell the FBI, even though an FBI memo corroborated that Marina had in fact said just what McKenzie was supposed to have told her to say.55 Murchison, a close friend of LBJ and J. Edgar Hoover, had hosted his friend and business partner, banker, and Warren Commission member John McCloy, on a visit to Texas during the summer of 1963. The Warren Commission did not pursue investigations of Oswald’s connections to intelligence agencies. The respected John Whitten initially ran the CIA investigation of the assassination, but Helms replaced him with Angleton when he complained that the CIA had omitted Oswald’s pro-Castro activities from his files.56 Angleton had close ties to Hoover, and quickly determined that Oswald’s Pro-Castro connections were not important. Whitten told HSCA staffers that if he had been given FBI and CIA pre-assassination files on Oswald, he would have investigated the CIA’s JM/WAVE station in Miami to explore what George Joannides, the station chief and SG and SAS, knew about Oswald.57 When public criticism of the Warren Report became widespread in late 1966, the CIA mobilized its assets to protect it. Through a lawsuit, attorney and author Mark Lane was able to obtain a top-secret CIA document, dated April 1, 1967, which explicitly outlined how to counter and discredit conspiracy theorists. Recall that certain writers, producers, and publishers who were intelligence assets doggedly defended the Report. Former DCI Richard Helms has stated that the CIA was “very helpful to Johnson [on the JFK Assassination] and met the new president’s request for an independent CIA study. Motion pictures of the Dallas motorcade and autopsy pictures were sent to the agency.”58 Although this report is still classified, hearsay evidence suggests that the new president seemingly did not find it compelling. An internal FBI memorandum, $4 / 4 / 6 7 $ , notes that FBI informant Jack Anderson was told by Johnson aide Marvin Watson that “the President told him, in an off moment, that he was now convinced that there was a plot in connection with the assassination. Watson stated the President felt that the CIA had something to do with this plot…”59 True magazine, April 1975, ran a revelatory piece by former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, Victor Marchetti, regarding CIA aid during the Garrison investigation.

Marchetti got explicit about attitudes and actions at the morning meetings of DCI Richard Helms, attended by 12 to 14 leading deputies and 3-4 top staffers. During the Clay Shaw trial I remember the Director on several occasions asking questions like, you know, Are we giving them all of the help that they need? I didn’t know who they or them were. I knew they didn’t like Garrison because there were a lot of snotty remarks about him. They would talk in half sentences like “is everything going all right down there … yea … but talk with me about it after the meeting.…” I began to ask myself what’s going on, what’s the big concern … one of the other people who attended the meeting … at one time said, “well Shaw a long time ago had been a contact of the agency – the Domestic Contact Service – its been cut off a long time ago…of course the agency doesn’t want this to come out because Garrison will distort it. The public will misconstrue it.” 60 Questions linger about the coverage of HSCA Chief Counsel Richard Sprague, the aggressive Assistant D.A. from Philadelphia, who wanted a thorough investigation. After his goal became known, Sprague was hit with a journalistic hatchet-job by David Burnham of the New York Times and Jeremiah O’Leary of the Washington Star, who had both previously worked with the CIA.61 The ensuing internal dissent within the HSCA was only partly resolved by Sprague’s resignation just a few months later. Sprague noted in retrospect that if he could start over he would begin by probing “Oswald’s ties to the CIA.”62 Sprague’s deputy counsel, Robert Tannenbaum, was told by Senator Richard Schweiker (R − Pa) “in my judgment the CIA was involved in the murder of the President.” Sprague had called David Phillips to testify regarding Oswald in Mexico City. He was probing how the FBI agents could have listened to a tape recording of Oswald talking with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in November, when Phillips said it had been destroyed in October. Sprague was pressured by the CIA to sign a secrecy oath to pursue the information but he refused, stating it was in conflict with the House Resolution. The CIA or Angleton alone, withheld files on the alleged September 1963 Oswald-Kostikov meeting (a Russian officer in covert actions in Mexico) from the Warren Commission and the HSCA.

Partially declassified CIA memos indicate that a member of the CIA’s Mexico City station reported, 10/16/63, that this officer determined that Oswald had talked with Kostikov, yet the person alleged to be Oswald, who was photographed walking into the Cuban and Soviet embassies, was heavy set, balding and middle-aged.63 The author of the memo was probably CIA Officer David Phillips. According to career CIA officer Joe B. Smith, J.C. King’s CIA men recruited David Phillips. “Dave’s not only a good writer; he’s a great snake oil salesman.”64 A revealing internal CIA memo from Phillips to Deputy Director Helms noted: “Unless you feel otherwise, Jim Angleton CIA Chief of Counter Intelligence would prefer to wait out the [HSCA] committee on this matter.”66 Former HSCA Counsel Sprague contends that his pursuit of CIA documents was the beginning of his fall. The next HSCA Chief Counsel, Robert Blakey, saw things quite differently; he even sought FBI and CIA clearance for hiring new employees. Chief researcher Robert Tannenbaum then quit and protested. “We’re supposed to be investigating them, instead they’re investigating us. Blakey met with CIA officer Larry Strawderman on 7/27/77, set the parameters for the HSCA; that certain areas of the investigation should be disregarded if they lack merit or corroboration; that the CIA could scrutinize the notes of HSCA investigators, who were only permitted to look at CIA documents in a closed room.” HSCA Researcher Donovan Gay, the keeper of the records, asked about access to CIA classified files and was fired by Blakey. Blakey told Gay, “It would be easier for the CIA if you left.”67 While the HSCA substantially clarified the role of the Mafia, the final report written by Chief Counsel Blakey and Dick Billings is remarkable for what it fails to cover regarding intelligence agencies and the military. Independent investigators presented significant information regarding the role played by the intelligence agencies to the HSCA in 1977; however, the price of being a Congressional research investigator was to sign a “nondisclosure agreement.” This meant that all evidence was handed over to the HSCA and could not be disclosed elsewhere. Much, if not most, of the-new information was not pursued, according to Congressional researchers and staffers Gaeton Fonzi, Robert Groden, Cliff Fenton, and Ed Lopez. Most of that information was sealed for fifty years in the National Archives, until the movie JFK forced much of its release.68 HSCA Chief Investigator Gaeton Fonzi was convinced that Oswald met with CIA case officer “Maurice Bishop,” a pseudonym for David Phillips.

Most of that information was sealed for fifty years in the National Archives, until the movie JFK forced much of its release.68 HSCA Chief Investigator Gaeton Fonzi was convinced that Oswald met with CIA case officer “Maurice Bishop,” a pseudonym for David Phillips. Fonzi based this on his extensive interviews with Antonio Veciana, an active anti-Castro Cuban, who repeatedly stated that he had once met with Oswald and Phillips. Veciana, an articulate accountant and leader of the terrorist anti-Castro group Alpha 66, had worked for years with “Bishop,” including a four year stint in Bolivia for the Agency for International Development (oftentimes a CIA front). Veciana spent almost all of his time there working on anti-Communist and anti-Castro activities, including, allegedly, an attempt to assassinate Castro in Chile in early 1971. Phillips even asked Veciana if his cousin Ruiz, who worked for Cuban intelligence and was stationed in Mexico City could be “offered a huge amount of money” to testify regarding Oswald’s Mexico visit.69 In 1995 Cuban General Fabian Escalante, who was in charge of Cuban units that infiltrated CIA controlled anti-Castro groups in the U.S., asserted that Phillips was “Bishop” and that Phillips recruited Veciana.70 After the assassination Phillips received a major promotion within the CIA. Robert Tannenbaum, the initial HSCA deputy counsel, agreed with Fonzi that “Bishop” was in fact David Phillips. Tannenbaum’s interrogation of Phillips regarding the FBI memo about Oswald being impersonated, as well as the pictures purportedly of Oswald entering the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City, trapped Phillips in lies. When Tannenbaum confronted Phillips with FBI memos about the Oswald photos not being recycled, “Phillips just folded the memos and walked out of the room.” Tannenbaum told the HSCA, “He’s in contempt and he committed perjury. Let him know it,” but the committee would not back him up. The assassination investigation then became tainted in the mainstream media, when false contentions led Tannenbaum and Chief Counsel Richard Sprague to resign.71 Congress responded by cutting the HSCA budget. Fonzi also interviewed Sylvia Odio, an anti-Castro activist who stated that she had a meeting with Lee Oswald and two anti-Castro Cubans in late fall of 1963. The anti-Castro Cubans used the noms de guerre “Leopoldo” and “Angel,” stating that they were members of Junta Revolutionary ( JURE) as well as the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Two days after the meeting “Leopoldo” called Odio and said Oswald was “an ex-marine an excellent marksman … tremendous asset, except you never know how to take him … he’s kind of loco … the American says we Cubans don’t have any guts … he says we should have shot Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs…” The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:334:7ace044f5326", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 628, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 335, "text": "noms de guerre “Leopoldo” and “Angel,” stating that they were members of Junta Revolutionary ( JURE) as well as the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

Although Sprague’s replacement, Notre Dame professor Robert Blakey, claimed to have received everything of significance from the CIA, an internal CIA memorandum stated that Blakey “spent only twenty or thirty minutes discussing and examining the contents of some fifteen safes of Agency materials.”72 The CIA memo further stated, “Oswald’s 201 file was not completely reviewed by HSCA staff members. One HSCA Staff member claimed that they did not review sixteen CIA file drawers, and noted that given the lack of access to the CIA file system it was not possible for the HSCA to tell if the CIA was responding fully. Blakey responded, “You don’t think they’d lie to me, do you? I’ve been working with those people for 20 years.”73 CIA involvement of E. Howard Hunt resurfaced in 1978. Victor Marchetti, former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, wrote an article in a small right-wing newspaper, Spotlight, run by Liberty Lobby, stating that he had seen an internal CIA memo from James Angleton, head of CIA Counterintelligence to CIA Director Richard Helms stating that E. Howard Hunt was in Dallas the day Kennedy was killed. Hunt sued and initially won $650, 000 in a 1981 libel suit against Liberty Lobby; however, in 1984 Liberty Lobby appealed the case to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and they proved that Hunt was in Dallas the day Kennedy was killed, and that indeed the memo did exist. Veteran CNN reporter, and quite reluctant witness, Joe Trento, had seen it. Attorney Mark Lane determined that James Angleton and former Marine officer William Corson were Marchetti’s sources. Further, CIA operative Marita Lorenz testified that Hunt was the paymaster of the operation that killed Kennedy.75 Lorenz had been part of a CIA mission to assassinate Fidel Castro, and had worked with various state and federal police organizations. According to Marchetti, the CIA was furious with Hunt for his role in Watergate. He was to be part of what is called a “limited hangout” during the HSCA hearings; that is, they would tell part of the story while protecting most of it. E. Howard Hunt was part of the CIA planning staff for the Guatemalan coup in 1954 along with General Cabell and Frank Wisner, later Chief of Covert Operations.

He was to be part of what is called a “limited hangout” during the HSCA hearings; that is, they would tell part of the story while protecting most of it. E. Howard Hunt was part of the CIA planning staff for the Guatemalan coup in 1954 along with General Cabell and Frank Wisner, later Chief of Covert Operations. Hunt was in the CIA Asian command until 1959 and then assisted in the Bay of Pigs planning, where he worked with General Cabell and CIA Deputy Director of Plans Richard Bissell. When the invasion failed, Hunt was named to outgoing CIA Director Dulles’s personal staff. A year later, after Dulles was fired, Tracy Barnes appointed Hunt to be the CIA’s first Chief of Covert Operations for Domestic Operations Division.76 This was a division designed for projects unwanted elsewhere in the CIA.77 By his own admission Hunt was active in recruiting and training anti-Castro Cubans in the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC). The second most important CRC base was in the same building where Guy Banister had his “detective agency” in New Orleans.78 When Mark Lane and CIA attorney Kevin Dunne in the Spotlight newspaper lawsuit deposed Marita Lorenz, who had been working as a contract agent with the CIA since 1959, she declared that she had known both Frank Sturgis (a CIA and Army Intelligence asset),79 and E. Howard Hunt, since then. While portions of her story have changed over the years, some of her testimony may be useful: In 1975, Frank Sturgis, one of Hunt’s fellow Watergate burglars, told Gaeton Fonzi that he felt others were pressuring Marita Lorenz to say things. Fonzi spoke with Sturgis’ wife, Jan, who played a taped conversation of Lorenz speaking to Sturgis wherein she claimed that two government agents spoke with her. It remains unclear as to how Lorenz could have afforded her fashionable Manhattan Upper East Side apartment. Let’s briefly backtrack to Jack Anderson’s 1971 columns on the CIA-mafia plots of 1960, involving Nixon but not JFK, which he asserted could have “backfired against JFK.” These columns caused a series of memos within the Nixon White House. Attorney General John Mitchell quickly relieved CIA-mafia liaison Robert Maheu from testifying in exchange for his silence on the Castro story. Two Senate Watergate Committee staffers stated that White House concern about Anderson’s article could have been a possible motivation for the Watergate break-in.81 Anderson was invited to lunch by Richard Helms (DCI) to convince him to omit some sensitive material in his next book. Anderson remained steadfast, and then got targeted by the “Plumbers” Unit. G. Gordon Liddy and E.

Howard Hunt, Jr. confessed during the Watergate hearings that they met with a CIA operative Dr. Edward Gunn, in 1972, to consider poisoning, drugging, or killing Anderson.82 Just prior to the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, the CIA called Nixon aide John Ehrlichman to claim that their assistance had ended. Ehrlichman said that the CIA was assisting Hunt. Soon thereafter, Nixon renewed his pursuit of CIA records. He directed Ehrlichman to tell Helms to hand over “full file [on Bay of Pigs] or else.” After two meetings with Helms, Ehrlichman briefed Nixon on Helms’ rationale for not sharing the documents. [Helms] said that his relationship with past presidents had been such that he would not feel comfortable about releasing some of the very, very dirty linen to anyone without talking it through with you, because he was sure that when you become a former president you would want to feel that whoever was at the agency was protecting your interest in a similar fashion. This is incredibly dirty linen … Helms is scared to death of this guy Hunt that we got working for us because he knows where a lot of the bodies are buried, and Helms is a bureaucrat first and he’s protecting that bureau.” When Helms arrived, Nixon pounded his desk and shouted: “the president needs to know everything! The real thing you need from me is this assurance: I am not going to embarrass the CIA, because it’s important. I believe in dirty tricks.” Ehrlichman notes quote Nixon as saying to Helms: “Purpose of request for documents must be fully advised in order to know what to duck; won’t hurt Agency, or attack predecessor,” Helms responded: “I regard myself as you know, really, as working entirely for you and everything I’ve got is yours.… Should I turn this [file] over to John?” It was, however, just a slim report by a Marine colonel who had been assisting the CIA during the Bay of Pigs. In his memoirs Nixon lamented that what Helms gave him was “incomplete … the CIA protects itself even from presidents.” According to top White House advisors during the Nixon Administration, the Watergate tapes contain clear references to the role of the CIA, and Hunt specifically, regarding the assassination. The taped Nixon conversation, 6/23/72 , with his Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman is revealing.

The taped Nixon conversation, 6/23/72 , with his Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman is revealing. Nixon: “Very bad to have this fellow Hunt … If it gets out that this is all involved the Cuba thing would become a fiasco. It would make the CIA look bad, and it’s likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing, which we think would be unfortunate.” Since the Bay of Pigs had occurred more than a decade before, how could it “become” a fiasco? The tape continues: “It tracks back to the Bay of Pigs, other leads run out to people who had no involvement … except by contacts and connections, but it gets into areas that are liable to be raised.” In Haldeman’s book, Ends of Power, he asserts that the Bay of Pigs was a code word for the JFK assassination. Nixon in his memoirs suggested that Hunt could have been a double agent, and he was perplexed as to why Hunt would deposit a $25, 000 cashier’s check into Watergate burglar Bernard Barker’s bank account. Nixon feared this revelation would open the “Bay of Pigs” thing again, and directed Haldeman to pressure Helms that Watergate “might be connected to the Bay of Pigs, and if it opens up the Bay of Pigs could be blown.Helms and his deputy were quickly directed to the White House. Haldeman wrote of “Turmoil in the room, Helms gripping the arms of his chair, leaning forward and shouting, and The Bay of Pigs had nothing. I have no concern for the Bay of Pigs. Silence…” I was absolutely shocked by Helm’s violent reaction. Haldeman reported back to Nixon that there was “no problem” any leads “that would be harmful to the government would be ignored.”83 James McCord’s actions during the Watergate break-in suggest intentional mistakes. McCord re-taped a garage-level door, which tipped off the police. Although McCord claimed to have removed the tape from the doors, actually several had been taped to stay unlocked. A few days later, all of McCord’s papers were destroyed in a fire at his home, while a CIA contract agent watched. James McCord had known E. Howard Hunt since the 1950s and worked with David Phillips in a domestic operation in 1961 against the FPCC, (Fair Play for Cuba Committee), the organization Oswald joined in 1962.84 McCord had a CIA clearance to work with the State Department, a Cryptographer clearance and a ^(α)Q^(η) clearance with the Pentagon since 1948.85 In August 1972 CIA Director Helms instructed McCord to send a letter to his friend Jack Caulfield, a N.Y. detective who worked with the Plumbers, and who had looked into Oswald’s Cuban connections for the FBI.

McCord wrote, “If Helms goes, and if the Watergate operation is laid at the CIA’s feet, where it does not belong, every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched earth. The whole matter is at the precipice right now. Just pass the message that if they want it to blow, they are on exactly the right course.”86 McCord’s letter to Judge John Sirica revealed portions of the Watergate cover-up which led to Nixon’s resignation. Haldeman argued that “After Kennedy was killed, the CIA launched a fantastic cover-up.… The CIA literally erased any connection between Kennedy’s assassination and the CIA … in fact Counter Intelligence Chief James Angleton of the CIA called Bill Sullivan of the FBI, head of Bureau Division Five in charge of domestic counterintelligence, the number three man under Hoover, and rehearsed the questions and answers they would have to give the Warren Commission.”88 Sullivan was the FBI liaison to the U. S. Information Board, which was chaired by the DCI, (Director of the Central Intelligence) and had as its participants high level agency chiefs from the intelligence community. Recall that it was Sullivan who directed FBI Agent Hosty not to cooperate with the Dallas Police at 4 : 06p.M . the day of the assassination.89 Incredibly, Sullivan was shot to death while hunting in Northern New Hampshire, November 9, 1977 – two days before he was scheduled to testify to the HSCA. Robert Daniels, a New Hampshire trooper with a .30/06 with a scope, shot him in the neck while he was in an open field. Other high-level FBI officers and former officers also died during this period.90 Hunt’s possible position in the assassination plot could explain the considerable leverage he had over President Nixon during the Watergate Scandal. It could also explain his blackmail threats, and the receipt of at least $154, 000 in “hush money.” Nixon apparently was prepared to offer as much as $2 million, promises of executive clemency, and even efforts to “stonewall” the investigation. Questions linger about the airplane crash that killed Hunt’s wife Dorothy, after she picked up an installment of the “hush money.” It may also explain why Nixon’s Presidential Counsel John Dean, by June 21, 1972, had E. Howard Hunt’s safe opened, as well as why Dean destroyed portions of Hunt’s notebooks on projects unrelated to Watergate. Nixon aide Ehrlichman told Dean to “deep six” certain of Hunt’s materials.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:339:33a5eebe0b3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 633, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 340, "text": "million, promises of executive clemency, and even efforts to “stonewall” the investigation.

Howard Hunt’s safe opened, as well as why Dean destroyed portions of Hunt’s notebooks on projects unrelated to Watergate. Nixon aide Ehrlichman told Dean to “deep six” certain of Hunt’s materials. Ehrlichman and Dean then communicated their intention to acting FBI director L. Patrick Gray to destroy some of Hunt’s files, which he did.91 Gray recalls that Dean said that these files were “political dynamite” that “should not see the light of day.” In December 2012, Dean told the Guardian that Hunt once told him that he gave the Watergate burglars a “sham…excuse” that they were searching for Cuban government support for the Democratic Party campaign.92 Finally in 1975, the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Foreign Assassinations established that “In August 1960, the CIA took steps to enlist members of the criminal underworld with gambling syndicate contacts to aid in the assassination of Castro.… Allen Dulles personally approved the plots, the two top planners for which were Richard Bissell and Colonel Sheffield Edwards.” The CIA Director of Security assigned his Operational Support Chief, General James O’Connell, a former FBI man, who contacted Robert Maheu. Robert Maheu, the top aide to Howard Hughes, later the employer of General Cabell, was the initial intermediary who went to Mafia leader John Roselli to begin setting up the murder plots. Roselli used Sam Giancana, the Chicago mob boss, and Santos Trafficante, mob boss of Tampa, to help plan the attempts. After the revelations of the Watergate hearings, Congress demanded further investigations of CIA activities. President Ford then assigned his newly appointed Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller to head an investigation into the roles of the FBI and CIA in the assassination of President Kennedy. With David Belin as Chief Counsel, one of the most imaginative of the Warren Commission counsel in ignoring information, this 1975 investigation attempted a strategic retreat. Then-Governor Ronald Reagan quietly sat on that Commission, which essentially reiterated the Warren Commission’s findings. The Rockefeller Commission was then followed in late 1975 by a more assertive Senate Intelligence Subcommittee of the Church Committee on the CIA and FBI, conducted by Senators Gary Hart and Richard Schweiker. George H.W. Bush was then appointed Director of the CIA to replace William Colby, who was vulnerable to Senate questioning from the Watergate revelations. The media-CIA information that Bush withheld from that Senate Intelligence Subcommittee still warrants investigation. George H.W. Bush was apparently working with the CIA back in 1963. An FBI memo quoted in a June 16, 1988, issue of The Nation showed that Bush, along with Captain William Edwards of the DIA, was briefed on “the attitudes", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:340:7c05ee31bdff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 634, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 341, "text": "Schweiker.

An FBI memo quoted in a June 16, 1988, issue of The Nation showed that Bush, along with Captain William Edwards of the DIA, was briefed on “the attitudes of anti-Castro Cubans” by the FBI’s W.T. Forsyth on November 23, 1963. This memo from J. Edgar Hoover notes that information was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the CIA.93 Forsyth, now dead, ran the investigation of Martin Luther King in the Bureau’s subversive control section. Some sources posit that Bush worked in the area of recruiting anti-Castro Cubans. The initial reaction of Senator Church, chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to the firing of William Colby and the naming of Bush as Director of the CIA, was to complain that it was part of a pattern of attempts by President Ford to impede the committee’s investigation into assassination plots. This was an investigation with which Colby had been cooperating but which Ford seemed to be trying to suppress. The notion of CIA-controlled anti-Castro Cuban shooters could be consistent with the testimony of witnesses in Dealey Plaza who stated that they saw people on the sixth floor with a Latino look or with dark complexions. Witness Arnold Rowland’s testimony to this effect was not only disregarded, he was also discredited as a witness, due to an unusual investigation by the FBI. Witness Ruby Henderson gave a similar eyewitness account to the FBI, yet was never questioned by the Warren Commission. Further, a number of inmates on the sixth floor of the nearby Dallas County Jail, including John Powell, also saw two men with dark complexions on the sixth floor of the Dallas School Book Depository. Yet these witnesses went unexamined. While evidence regarding the assassins, or “mechanics” as the intelligence agencies would refer to them, is uncorroborated, the ongoing role of the CIA relationship with Oswald and the anti-Castro Cubans is becoming more clear. Both current and former top CIA officials had motives, means and opportunity to generate and cover up the assassination. They were experienced in these matters. CIA media assets, along with FBI Director Hoover and Assistant Attorney General Katzenbach initiated a cover-up. This was greatly assisted by the CIA Deputy-Director Richard Helms and former CIA Director Allen Dulles on the Warren Commission. According to George Lardner’s 1992 Washington Post interview with CIA Director Robert Gates, “the CIA has 250,000 - 300,000 pages of files pertaining to the assassination, including 33,000 on Oswald – most of them received from other agencies.” Following the assassination of President Kennedy, the CIA rapidly expanded its scope and methods.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:341:10868216d204", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 635, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 342, "text": "and Assistant Attorney General Katzenbach initiated a cover-up.

From 1964-1967 the CIA budget almost doubled. CIA agent Ralph McGehee, in Deadly Deceits: My Twenty-five Years at the CIA noted, “the period from 1964-1967 was the most active era for covert operations.” By 1974 the CIA had spent over $1 billion for propaganda activities, according to Victor Marchetti.94 John McCone, former CIA Director and at the time a member of the board of ITT, told a Senate committee in 1977 that he had discussed getting rid of Allende in Chile when ITT’s properties were at risk of nationalization. In Latin America in the 1960s, CIA programs were used to teach Latin American police and military officers torture, surveillance methods, bomb making, and counterinsurgency to be used against liberals as well as communists. CIA officers even ran background checks on employees of U.S.-based multinationals. Aspects of CIA-military cooperation surfaced in the 1970s, which indicated building upon the close psychological warfare cooperation developed during WW II and expanded during the Cold War, Jack Anderson observed in his column, 4/21/71, that the “CIA never makes a move without the DIA keeping close surveillance. Colonel Fletcher Prouty described extensive CIA – DOD cooperation in The Secret Team, and in a story for Gallery, 12/15, “The Fourth Force.”95 In the 1940’s Washington came up with a war plan that called for the creation of mobile, airlifted forces with global capability that could be dispatched immediately to areas in the Soviet Union where damage and radioactivity would be minimal following nuclear war. These forces would have the ability to form a military government and establish a communications system in the devastated areas. At that time the CIA was assisting with the administration and questioning of tens of thousands of defectors from Eastern Europe. The Agency had countless leads into Eastern Europe and some, if exploited properly, would even stretch into Russia. Thus the CIA came to take an active part in this super secret war planning. The Agency established a presence in the Pentagon and in the major United States military headquarters all over the world. The Agency had available hundreds of skilled former military men. Most retained their reserve status while others were given equivalent rank. Some CIA personnel carried letters of authority that gave them rank above that of any three-star general or admiral. The CIA was moving in. The CIA, under Allen Dulles, put exceptionally able operatives into each military headquarters.

The CIA was moving in. The CIA, under Allen Dulles, put exceptionally able operatives into each military headquarters. The over-worked planning staffs found these extra hands ready and eager to help with any odd task. Such offices as subsidiary plans, special operation, psychological warfare, and unconventional warfare, began to spring up and they were all loaded with “helpful” CIA men. The law that created the CIA specifically prohibited the agency from building up forces for clandestine operations. The Secretary of Defense in the late 1940’s, Louis Johnson, had informed the Director of Central Intelligence that if the Agency needed military equipment it would have to pay cash for whatever it ordered. In those days the CIA budget was small, so this order effectively controlled any undue clandestine use of military equipment in foreign countries by the CIA. President Eisenhower continued the policy. One of the old clandestine operations documents known as NSCID 10/2 was updated to NSC 5412/2 and it set forth limitations concerning the role the CIA could play in clandestine operations. In the margin of one of the master copies of NSC 5412/2 Eisenhower had noted in his own handwriting that nothing was to be given to the CIA; that would enable it to create a force that would permit it to operate over any lengthy period of time, or to be able to operate in such a manner that the operation would not remain “covert.” In other words, clandestine operations were to be small and “one time” – so said Eisenhower. As the exercise took shape and the military forces began to prepare for their roles, the CIA asked for weapons, trucks, radios, jeeps, and other items it would need to “play” Fourth Force. This was a problem. The military couldn’t fund the CIA and the CIA could not go to Congress itself and ask for military equipment on a permanent basis. The military forces came up with a solution. The Army, Navy, and Air Force all created phony CIA cover units. Then they let the CIA “equip” these units according to the war plan and in time the CIA acquired a huge stockpile of military equipment, even aircraft, ostensibly for its formal Fourth Force mission. Over the next few years the CIA amassed more and more equipment. Its phony Army, Navy, and Air Force units did not have the usual “equipment lists” or “tables of equipment” that other United States military organizations had; so the Agency had in effect an open-ended horn of plenty.

Warehouses in England, Germany, Libya, Okinawa, and the Philippines, among others, were bulging with CIA-owned military hardware. By the mid-1950s the CIA was ready to exploit its new capability. It turned its back on hard-core Soviet and East European targets and began to operate secretly in the realm of the Third World. (When it wanted to equip a rebel cabal to overthrow some government the CIA did not have to ask anyone for weaponry. It could ask the Air Force for planes to fly “training equipment” into some country; and the next thing anyone knew a well-equipped and well-financed rebel force would be rising up against an “enemy” government) The United States armed forces, meanwhile, had no idea how much equipment the CIA had gleaned from them. I recall in 1962 telling Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the CIA had ‘hundreds of military units and that they were all well armed and equipped.” He said he didn’t know it had become as extensive as that. The CIA has the world’s largest private airline. It is generally known as Air America and it is part of the Pacific Corporation. But Air America itself has on occasion had more than one hundred subordinate affiliates all over the world. At one time Air America had more than four thousand men each on two separate bases. Of course, these bases appeared to be U.S. military bases and needed protection, which in turn involved the assignment of regular military forces. CIA cooperation with the Secret Service seems significant as well. The CIA Technical Services Division furnished the Secret Service with “gate passes, security passes, passes for presidential campaign emblems for presidential vehicles, and a secure 10 photo system.” A 1963 CIA memo written by Technical Services Director Stanley Gottlieb was declassified after a lengthy FOIA lawsuit.96 This could be the source of I.D. for those in Dealey Plaza who presented Secret Service I.D. to Dallas law enforcement. Research by Anna Marie Kuhns Walko and Larry Hancock indicates that anti-Castro Cuban and CIA asset, Roy Hargraves, had Secret Service credentials and was in Dallas in November of 1963.97 The fearful reactions of CIA asset Garret Underhill after the assassination raise still more questions.

Underhill, an expert on weapons and covert warfare, had long worked on special assignments consulting for Henry Luce of Time-Life, as well as Esquire, Colliers, Fortune and the Washington Post. In the 1950’s Underhill was associated with CIA asset Samuel Cummings, who supplied weapons to resistance groups in Eastern Europe through INTERARMCO, (Hancock, 320-321). Underhill confided to his close friends Bob and Charlene Fitzsimmons that “Oswald was a patsy … I’ve been hearing things.… They’ve killed the President.… A violent group within the CIA … they knew that he had learned.… The CIA is under enough pressure already without that bunch in Southeast Asia…” Underhill also shared his fears with Asher Brynes, a contributing editor for The New Republic. He fled Washington DC, and quietly investigated the assassination. When Brynes visited Underhill in May 1964 she found him in bed, dead from a shot behind his left ear. The coroner ruled the death a suicide but Brynes disagreed. Underhill’s wife would not talk with anyone, and refused to share his writings on the assassination.99 Ramparts’ reporting on Underhill, in June 1967, brought this to Jim Garrison’s attention. The extensive cooperation between banks and corporations with the CIA also clouds causality. Did elements of the CIA operationalize an agenda in America that they had used overseas? The Western Hemispheric Operations Division 3 of the CIA appears to have the strongest need of any regional desk to redact and continue to classify documents. The ARRB estimates that “about 50,000 pages” related to JFK’s murder have not been released. The continued classification of documents regarding CIA officer George Joannides highlights the ongoing cover-up. Joannides coordinated DRE, a CIA-backed group that Oswald encountered as a Castro sympathizer. During the HSCA investigation, Joannides was conveniently selected by the CIA to be the liaison to the committee. Years later, HSCA chief counsel Robert Blakey declared, “I no longer believe anything the Agency [CIA] told the committee any further than I can obtain substantial corroboration for it outside of the Agency for its veracity.… We also now know that the Agency set up a process that could only be designed to frustrate the ability of the committee in 1976-79 to obtain any information that might adversely affect the Agency. Many people have told me that the culture of the Agency is one of prevarication and dissimulation and that you cannot trust its people, Period … I am now in that camp.”100 In 2014 at the AARC conference Blakey called the CIA treatment of the HSCA “treacherous.” Newly declassified records show that Angleton and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:345:e53e45d640f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 639, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 346, "text": "a process that could only be designed to frustrate the ability of the committee in 1976-79 to obtain any information that might adversely affect the Agency.

CIA routing memos indicate that early intelligence on Oswald (December 1959) went to Angleton and his aide Ann Egerter. Egerter opened a public file on Oswald (a 201 file) only after Oswald appeared on a State Department list of defectors to the Soviet Union. Why did Angleton withhold his knowledge of Oswald, from 1959 until after the assassination, and then lie about what he knew about Oswald? Jane Roman, a senior CIA Counter-Intelligence officer whose husband was a personal assistant to Allan Dulles, was asked to respond to a routine inquiry, the first week of October 1963, from the Mexico City Station on Lee Oswald. Although she had worked recently with the file, she signed off on a report that she knew was inaccurate. When confronted with documents 31 years later by Jefferson Morley and Dr. John Newman she admitted “I’m signing off on something that’s not true.” When pushed by Newman, she also admitted that “to me it indicates a keen interest [in Oswald], held very closely on a need-to-know basis.” George Joannides’ patron within the CIA was Greek-American Tom Karamassines, who was the trusted assistant to DDP Richard Helms. Karamassines was the most senior officer to sign off on a cable 10/10/63 regarding Oswald in Mexico City, which omitted the September 1963 FBI report on Oswald’s encounters with DRE in New Orleans. Much fog remains surrounding Oswald’s movements in Mexico City. After the assassination of President Kennedy, CIA Mexico Station Chief Win Scott aggressively moved to have Sylvia Duran, a receptionist at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, interrogated by Mexican authorities. She was the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, who met with someone claiming to be Lee Oswald, who wanted to get a transit visa for Cuba. Karamassines instructed Scott: Duran told Mexican authorities that the man who visited the Cuban consulate was blond with blue or green eyes, which could not have been Lee Oswald.

Years later Duran was interviewed by the HSCA but that testimony remains classified. She told author Anthony Summers that she told the HSC that the man who visited the Cuban Consulate was about her size, five foot one and one half inches. Duran also stated that the pictures of Oswald after the assassination were “not like the man she saw here in Mexico City.” Did Karamessine’s order to Win Scott, within a day of the assassination, show a strategy to protect their “freedom of action” to blame the assassination on Cuba? Since the CIA is heavily compartmentalized, and their decision-making process is generally as opaque as their cryptonyms, good researchers move slowly. Many CIA files are “soft files,” in essence, files kept in a desk and possibly not documented in any documentary record. Some files, like Win Scott’s legendary ω^(ω)P^(′) files, were destroyed, while some files, like Angleton’s got dispersed throughout the agency. Further, when DCI’s Gates and later Tenet issued directives for Office of Security files to be surfaced, they did not surface. Only when the ARRB found an earlier citing of Oswald’s files from the HSCA did most of the “missing” files surface. Allen Dulles spent the evening of the assassination of President Kennedy at a top secret CIA facility near Williamsburg, Camp Peary, or “The Farm.” According to former CIA agents, training at “The Farm” included assassinations. HSCA investigator Dan Hardaway stated that “The Farm was basically an alternative CIA headquarters where Dulles could direct ops.” Win Scott received the CIA’s highest honor, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, and he was planning to publish his memoir before his untimely death in 1971. Angleton knew that Scott’s account of Oswald’s visit to Mexico City would contradict the CIA’s version in the Warren Report regarding Oswald’s Cuban contacts. It was Angleton who visited Scott’s widow two days after his death to express condolences and retrieve the unpublished manuscript.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties and democratic processes. As John Kennedy took his presidential oath, the government had long been bitterly divided over the Cold War. By 1949 Secretary of Defense James Forrestal had endured “constant attack from the admirals and generals he supposedly commanded.” Forrestal was “ground down by the bickering and backstabbing of the Pentagon” and suffered a nervous breakdown. President Eisenhower later stridently warned of a military industrial complex after eight years of battling with them. “Any person who doesn’t clearly understand that national security and national solvency are mutually dependent, and that permanent maintenance of a crushing weight of military power would eventually produce dictatorship should not be entrusted with any kind of responsibility in our country.”1 Cold war zealots viewed themselves as practical patriots. Leading Republican Senator Barry Goldwater warned “Neutralism, coexistence, appeasement, pacifism, unilateral disarmament and the suspension of nuclear testing are all products of the enervating fog of fear that smothers the Free World.” General Edwin Walker declared Eisenhower to be a dedicated communist, and General Lyman Lemnitzer supported Walker’s efforts to politicize military culture. General Curtis LeMay, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force declared, “It boils down to this: Are we going to continue to permit areas of the Free World to be dragged behind the Iron Curtain and have the Free World get smaller and smaller and the communist controlled areas get larger and larger?” The military was indoctrinating the troops with anti-communist propaganda, the Defense Department was not backing the State Department, and dissident military leaders were giving stridently anti-communist speeches to the public. Kennedy responded by ordering that all public speeches by military officers be limited to military subjects, as well as to be non-political and consistent with the State Department. Henceforth, DOD reviewed military speeches. Kennedy then relieved General Walker of his command in Europe for accusing former President Truman of being “pink.” The furious Pentagon reaction led to hearings by a Senate Select Committee. Kennedy’s conflicts with the military in philosophy and strategy accelerated after the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961.

Kennedy’s conflicts with the military in philosophy and strategy accelerated after the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961. The CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by trusted Dulles ally General Lemnitzer, supported the failed invasion by anti-Castro Cubans. Castro’s troops were waiting for them, no spontaneous internal uprisings occurred, and the invaders ran out of ammunition on the beach. The Joint Chiefs bellowed for air support but Kennedy refused. When the invasion forces became trapped on the Cuban beaches, Kennedy convened an extraordinary meeting of civilian and military leaders. Admiral Arleigh Burke and General Lemnitzer joined Richard Bissell (CIA Covert Action Chief) in pushing Kennedy hard to provide air cover. Bissell and Burke saw the operation as so vital to national security that they had already broken the chain of command. Bissell instructed the Bay of Pigs brigade in Guatemala to mutiny against their U.S. advisors if the administration tried to block the invasion. Burke sent the U.S. aircraft carrier Essex and helicopter ship Boxer close to the Cuban coast. He disregarded Kennedy’s order to keep U.S. ships fifty miles offshore.3 Burke roared at Kennedy to engage a destroyer to “knock the hell out of Castro’s tanks” but Kennedy stood his ground. Internal CIA memos indicate that the invasion was “unachievable, except as a joint Agency/ DOD (CIA/ Pentagon) action.” There is no evidence that the CIA informed Kennedy of these analyses. The enraged Lemnitzer deplored Kennedy’s caution as “pulling out the rug. It’s absolutely reprehensible and almost criminal.” General Lauris Norstad, Supreme Commander Allied Forces in Europe, told a friend that this was the worst American defeat “since the war of 1812.” Admiral Burke viewed Kennedy as “inexperienced … a very bad president … who jeopardized the nation.”4 General LeMay viewed Kennedy’s administration as “the most egotistical people he had seen in his life … they had no respect for the military at all.” Years later, LeMay, in an oral history for the LBJ library, referred to the Kennedy crowd as “ruthless, vindictive … cockroaches.” General LeMay, “Old Iron Ass,” was a gifted pilot and organizer, and had rapidly expanded the Strategic Air Command after assuming power in 1948. By the mid-1950s he oversaw 200,000 personnel from 55 bases, “an air force within an air force,” and a “cocked gun.” Eisenhower’s strategy of massive retaliation “catalyzed” the massive modernization program, which as an economic stimulus made LeMay a welcome speaker in Congress.5 Time viewed LeMay as “the indispensable man in the Air Force’s top field command,” Life described him as “the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:349:d5e70e81155f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 643, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 350, "text": "a gifted pilot and organizer, and had rapidly expanded the Strategic Air Command after assuming power in 1948.

He pushed one conviction at SAC, “we are at war.”6 At the National Security Council meeting June 20th, 1961 General Lemnitzer and Allen Dulles proposed an official plan for a surprise nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. According to historian Arthur Schlesinger, Dean Rusk and McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy walked out in disgust in the middle of the meeting.9 Now in retrospect, I know damn well that they didn’t have any intention of giving me the straight word on this.… Looking back at the whole Cuban mess, one of the things that appalled me was the lack of broad judgment by some of the heads of the military services. They wanted to fight and probably calculated that if we committed ourselves part way and started to lose, I would probably give the OK to pour in whatever else was needed. I found out… that when it comes to making decisions I want facts more than advice.10 Perhaps the relationship between Kennedy and the Joint Chiefs “reached a new low,” according to the New York Times military correspondent Hanson Baldwin, when Kennedy ordered the FBI to search the Pentagon offices to clarify the origin of press leaks on the Berlin Crisis. Kennedy was challenged by his top military envoy to Berlin, General Lucius Clay. According to David Talbot: Valentin Fallon, Soviet ambassador to West Germany, said Moscow later learned that Clay had ordered his tank commanders to knock down the Berlin Wall – As he had instructed them to practice doing it in a nearby forest, without informing the White House. If that had happened, Soviet troops would have returned fire … and slid closer to the third world war. Clay responded to a call from Kennedy, “We’re not worried about our nerves. We’re worrying about those of you people in Washington.”11 After one meeting with the Joint Chiefs during the Berlin crisis, a furious JFK left the room stating, “These people are crazy.”12 Kennedy used", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:350:9622182ed39e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 644, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 351, "text": "instructed them to practice doing it in a nearby forest, without informing the White House.

Clay’s unauthorized provocation led to a standoff with Soviet tanks at “Checkpoint Charlie.” Robert Kennedy Jr. recounted, “JFK promised that if Khrushchev withdrew his tanks within 24 hours, the U.S. would pull back twenty minutes later.” Khrushchev did and so did Kennedy. Two weeks later, with tensions still running high, Khrushchev sent a second letter to JFK, “I have no ground to retreat further, there is a precipice behind [me] .” Khrushchev was also powerfully pushed by his military and intelligence complex.13 It is not clear if Kennedy ever trusted the CIA and Joint Chiefs of Staff again, and he formed his own private National Security Council. Retired General Maxwell Taylor’s investigation of the Bay of Pigs led to Kennedy appointing him as a special assistant. Taylor was given four aides, one from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and one from the civilian sector, and was asked to concentrate on Laos, Berlin and overall intelligence. Taylor and General Chester Clifton, the President’s Army aide, would give him daily briefings on global events. Taylor then developed a “little national security council” consisting of himself, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Rusk, Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon, and White House Advisor McGeorge Bundy. Kennedy’s restructuring had insulated him from the Joint Chiefs, and the National Security Council, which included the intelligence agencies. McNamara’s restructuring at the Department of Defense to develop efficiency based on a corporate model served to further the isolation, distrust, and anger of the Joint Chiefs. 1.

In years past, mainly military men ran defense of the U.S. – suddenly all that has changed, in the Pentagon, military men say they are being forced to the sidelines by civilians, their advice, either ignored or not given proper hearing in many vital military matters… President Kennedy’s restructuring of the military, the muzzling of military brass, the installation of a civilian authority, his policies in Berlin, Laos, Cuba and Vietnam, his rejection of Operation Northwoods, and his rethinking tactical nuclear weapons strategies in Europe, deepened dissent, distrust, and fear throughout the military brass. The Cuban Missile Crisis strengthened these sentiments. By October 1962 hard evidence indicated that the Soviets were building missile sites in Cuba. The Joint Chiefs adamantly asserted that invasion was essential to America’s security. Kennedy’s decision to run a naval quarantine prevailed and succeeded, yet widening factions of the military now viewed him as a dangerous threat to national security. As popularized in the movie Thirteen Days, during the crisis Generals LeMay and Thomas Powers (SAC Commander) along with other in the top brass and the CIA pushed provocative behaviors and rules of engagement. These actions heightened tensions, seemingly seeking to promote a military confrontation with the Soviets. General Powers raised the readiness of SAC to DEFCON-2, one step away from war, without the president’s authorization.16 Instead of issuing this order in code; he sent it in the clear to ensure that the Soviets could pick it up.17 Powers argued at an Ex-Com meeting, “Restraint? Why are you so concerned with saving their lives? The whole idea is to kill the bastards…” Even though the Joint Chiefs were actively engaged in contingency planning throughout the crises, they were not directly privy to Ex-Com (Executive Committee). In his memoirs General Maxwell Taylor acknowledged that some of the Chiefs distrusted him. Over the course of the crises he repeatedly volunteered to arrange more meetings with the President, but none of the Service Chiefs showed any interest. The Joint Chiefs were never consulted, nor were they given an opportunity to comment on the strategic implications of the settlement.18 Khrushchev recounted that during the Cuban Missile Crisis Robert Kennedy told Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, “The President is in a grave situation. We are under very severe stress.

In fact, we are under pressure from our military to use force against Cuba.… That is why the President is appealing directly to Chairman Khrushchev for his help in liquidating the conflict. If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power. The American army could get out of control.”19 We will never know to what extent this statement was a bargaining ploy. Recall that less than two years later, October 14, 1964,. Soviet Premier Khrushchev was overthrown by a bloodless military coup d’état in the Soviet Union. Kennedy confidante and Navy Undersecretary, Paul Fay, recalled in The Pleasure of his Company that JFK calmly spoke of the possibility of a military takeover if a third “Bay of Pigs” type of failure occurred to a young President. “The military would almost feel that it was their patriotic obligation to stand ready to preserve the integrity of the democracy, and only God knows what segment of democracy they would be defending if they overthrew the elected establishment.”20 Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers) was then consulting with Air Force generals and colonels on nuclear strategy and recalled “fury” after the Kennedy – Khrushchev settlement. “There was virtually a coup atmosphere in Pentagon circles…hatred and rage…”21 Tensions with the JCS were at an all-time high – the compromises and concessions were seen as excessive and unnecessary.” Kayser, a deputy national security advisor for Kennedy, recounted to author David Talbot that the Air Force hid Carl Romney, the man in charge of the Air Force operation monitoring Russian underground testing from Iran and Pakistan, from him.22 The prestige and power of the JCS had never been lower than at the close of the Test Ban debate.23 Nonetheless, the JCS again proposed in May 1963 that “the engineering of a series of provocations to justify military intervention [in Cuba] is feasible and could be accomplished with the resources available.” The president then confronted the JCS and the military industrial complex on the TFX contract. In the big battle for the $6.5 billion to produce a new tactical fighter jet between Boeing and General Dynamics, the multi-agency Source Selection Board had chosen Boeing. The Kennedy team, led by McNamara, instead awarded General Dynamics the contract on grounds of efficiency and politics (jobs in Democratic districts). Colonel Fletcher Prouty notes, “The decision sent tremors throughout the entire aeronautical industry and business world.” McNamara told Congress that the services would no longer be allowed to develop their own weapons systems.24 By defining our goal more clearly,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:353:e2bc53f88d15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 647, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 354, "text": "produce a new tactical fighter jet between Boeing and General Dynamics, the multi-agency Source Selection Board had chosen Boeing.

We will not be the first to resume. Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal binding treaty, but I hope it will achieve one, nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament, but I hope it will help us achieve it… Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each generation.

And there are even a few who say that it is true that Communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let them come to Berlin. Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect, but we never had to put up a wall to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us. All free men, wherever they may live are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words ‘Ich bin ein Berliner.’ High officers in the Armed Forces are deeply concerned over what they say is an apparent trend in U.S. Defense policy to “disarm by example.” They insist the present policies are weakening the U.S. position relative to Russia and will go on weakening it until a shift in the balance of power will threaten. It was over unanimous opposition of the Joint Chiefs of the country’s military services, reported but withdrawn at the last moment, that the U.S. negotiated with Russia on a nuclear test ban treaty… the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on at least two occasions, filed written formal dissents to the administration’s proposals for such a ban… Last spring the Chiefs of the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marines told the Senate Armed Services Committee that testing in the atmosphere was absolutely vital.… A major upheaval in U.S. defense is now taking place. A vast arsenal is being cancelled or dismantled. The Kennedy Administration is not responsible. The military establishment feels that the new strategy adds up to a type of intentional, one-sided disarmament … the Joint Chiefs of Staff, often with unanimity, have opposed almost all of the cutbacks now being considered. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures… If this pause in the cold war merely leads to its renewal not its end – then the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at us all … if we can now be as bold and farsighted in the control of deadly weapons as we have been in their creation – then surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey…a desire not to bury ones adversary, but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:355:0eb5bc511184", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 649, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 356, "text": "quietly building new structures… If this pause in the cold war merely leads to its renewal not its end – then the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at us all … if we can now be as bold and farsighted in the control of deadly weapons as we have been in their creation – then surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey…a desire not to bury ones adversary, but to compete in a host of peaceful arenas in ideas, in production and ultimately in service to all mankind. Kennedy’s plans to withdraw from Vietnam in late 1963 were perceived by the JCS as “an ominous repetition of the stalemate in Korea – A remote war, offering no sign of early resolution, consuming previous resources, and diverting attention from larger threats. Hence their support for a more aggressive, immediate strategy to confront the enemy directly with strong, decisive force.”25 These actions, combined with clear signals from JFK to consider normalizing relations with Cuba, the development of the Alliance for Progress, as well as a draw-down in Vietnam, further confirmed to the Joint Chiefs and many in the top brass that Kennedy was a major threat to national security. Former JFK Special Advisor Arthur Schlesinger bluntly stated, “We were at war with the national security people.”26 After the assassination of President Kennedy, the immediate reversals in foreign policy regarding Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cuba, the major cuts in the Alliance for Progress, the increased CIA covert actions, the increased reliance on his private NSC, the increased defense spending and the termination of negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty raise real circumstantial questions. The military’s withholding, destruction, and loss of evidence related to the assassination; their use of questionable methods and procedures, before and after the assassination, open other perspectives regarding their role. Just hours after the assassination the White House Situation Room, “Crown,” contacted both Air Force One and Air Force 2 by radio to inform the many cabinet members aboard that “there was not a conspiracy…and that someone named Oswald who had been to the Soviet Union had done this.” Recall that Oswald was not charged with the murder of the president until about seven hours later. Doug Horne, who served as chief counsel for the ARRB, wrote that the first version of these tapes released in the 1970s was edited and condensed. In 2011 a longer version (27 minutes longer) was found in the effects of Army Brigadier General Chester Clifton. Notably, the second version reveals evidence of General LeMay being urgently contacted by his aide Colonel Dorman, which allowed LeMay to break orders and attend the autopsy at Bethesda.

A discussion unfolded regarding autopsy procedure as well as which caskets should be used. Further, since three wave-lengths were utilized in communication, and the Clifton tapes are only two hours and 22 minutes – where are the other 51/2 hours of tapes? Was Oswald framed from the outset? Radio communication for Air Force 1, the Strategic Air Command, and for the plane carrying the Kennedy Cabinet was through Collins Radio – whose founder, Art Collins, was a friend of General Curtis LeMay.27 Presidential historian Theodore White described the announcement in The Making of the President 1964, “on the flight the party learned that there was no conspiracy, learned of the identity of Oswald and his arrest.” This was confirmed by a state department official, Robert Manning, who was on board the Air Force Boeing 707 with cabinet members returning to Washington.28 White and reporter William Manchester seem to have had access to the unedited tapes, since they quote passages which are not on the existing tapes. Recall that Dallas Mayor Earle Cabell’s brother, CIA Deputy Director General Charles Cabell, was fired by Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs. General Cabell was Dulles’s close ally and top assistant. His brother Earle collaborated on the Dallas motorcade route and was perhaps the first public official to assert that the assassination was “an irrational act … of a deranged mind.” (Dallas Morning News 11/23/63). Documents finally declassified in 2017 confirm that Earle Cabell was a CIA asset. Oswald was trained to speak Russian at El Toro Marine base and appears to have been involved with Naval Intelligence. (ONI) He worked as a radar operator at Cubi Point in the Philippines, and then at the Marine Air Base in Atsugi, Japan, where the CIA ran a squadron of super-secret U-2 spy planes. He had a “Crypto” clearance – higher than “Top Secret.” When Oswald was arrested in Dallas, he was carrying a military ID issued for those injured on active duty to insure medical coverage or for civilian employees overseas who needed military I.D. Similar I.D. was carried by U-2 pilot Gary Powers. This card was finally released by the FBI in December 1966 and was noted in former Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry’s book, Assassination File. 29 Oswald’s card DD1173-N4 was issued 9/11/59, before his “defection” to the Soviet Union. Oswald’s “defection” was immediately described as an “intelligence” matter by ONI, and over the years Marine G-2 (intelligence) sustained interest in Oswald. ONI, G-2, and the FBI have long collaborated, yet they failed to share files with JFK’s head of the DIA,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:357:e5da3cf1af19", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 651, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 358, "text": "This card was finally released by the FBI in December 1966 and was noted in former Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry’s book, Assassination File. 29 Oswald’s card DD1173-N4 was issued 9/11/59, before his “defection” to the Soviet Union.

Oswald’s friend George de Mohrenschildt had CIA and military connections. De Mohrenschildt’s wife and daughter both said that George got Oswald the job at Jaggars. This job, like the job at Atsugi Base, required a “top secret” clearance. Some of the work appeared to be related to U-2 missions, some of which were over Cuba. During this period de Mohrenschildt introduced Oswald and his wife to the chief of industrial security for General Dynamics in Fort Worth, retired Air Force Colonel Max Clark, as well as Colonel Lawrence Orlov, and Admiral Chester Bruton, among others. De Mohrenschildt was a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club, which included George H.W. Bush, George Bauhe and D. H. Byrd – owner of the TSBD building. Byrd was an owner of LTV, a major Air Force contractor, which produced aircraft as well as electronic guidance systems for reconnaissance planes and missile systems. Byrd was friends with Generals Doolittle and LeMay as well as LBJ. In May 1963 LeMay awarded Byrd an Air Force award for his founding of the Civil Air Patrol, a volunteer military group that Oswald had joined as a teen.31 De Mohrenschildt also introduced the Oswalds to Michael and Ruth Paine. In April 1963 de Mohrenschildt wrote a letter to LBJ, which contained the suggestion to meet with LBJ’s security advisor Colonel Howard Burris. They did meet Burris, a Texas oilman, who was friends with General Charles Cabell and CIA officer Richard Helms. Burris retained his position as LBJ’s top military aide after the assassination and rapidly made a fortune in the oil business. Later, Burris’ son married the niece of the Shah of Iran, a close friend of Helms. Burris’ close friend, Colonel O’Wighton Delk Simpson, had worked with him politically for LBJ and in intelligence matters. Colonel Simpson’s son, Delk Jr., testified to the HSCA, 7/18/78, that his dad was a “bagman” for the assassination. He recounted that he saw his father counting money that he had brought back from Haiti in the summer of 1963 that his father admitted was to be used in the assassination. Delk Jr’s girlfriend, Didi Hess, stated that Colonel Simpson told her he became involved “because it was necessary.” The HSCA did not investigate the story.32 Delk Simpson was also close to the CIA, since he later served on the board of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:358:1c37166403dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 652, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 359, "text": "dad was a “bagman” for the assassination.

Oswald worked in New Orleans for Guy Banister, who had been in the Office of Naval Intelligence before working with the FBI. Oswald also worked with David Ferrie and Clay Shaw, both with CIA connections, out of Banister’s office surrounded by ONI, CIA and FBI offices in New Orleans. He later worked briefly in New Orleans for the William Reilly Coffee Company. Reilly was a CIA asset, and three of his employees moved on to NASA after Oswald departed. Military connections to the motorcade, the investigation, and the autopsy also seem significant, yet they are still shrouded in mystery. The Fourth Army Group and its 112th Military Intelligence Group (MIG) headquartered at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio worked with the 316th counter-intelligence unit. The 112th worked closely with the FBI and local police departments, police “red squads,” the ATF and the Secret Service. Jones stated that, “We provided a small force – I do not recall how many but I would estimate between eight and twelve – during the presidential trip to San Antonio, Texas and then the following day, on his visit to Dallas. The Regions also provided additional people to assist … James Powell was one of those liaison personnel … he was a Captain and also wore civilian clothes and was assigned to Region 2 of the 112th MIG. He was on duty the day of the assassination.” Colonel Maximillian Reich and his deputy Major Jose Cabaya Sr. were never questioned but have publicly contradicted portions of Jones’ testimony. They assert that the morning of the assassination, the 316th Counter-Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio was told to “stand down” rather than report for duty in Dallas. This order superseded the “violent” protests of the unit commander Colonel Maximillian Reich, and Major Jose Cabaya Sr. CIA-Pentagon liaison Colonel Fletcher Prouty wrote, “Who has the power to make this kind of call? Only someone with [military code] knowledge can make the call and use such code words that are needed to ‘stand down’ an entire army unit.” Was it a coincidence that Secret Service agent Winston Lawson, who was partially responsible for changing the parade route in Dallas, had been an Army counterintelligence agent as well as Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) of the Liaison Division?

Lawson met with the Dallas Citizen’s Council to plan the trip and insisted on a motorcade. Lawson also met with Dallas Police Captain W.P. Gannaway, head of the Dallas Police Special Service Bureau, who was a member of the Army Intelligence Reserve. Gannaway’s secretary was reported by an out of town police chief to be “closely connected” to Jack Ruby.34 Gannaway’s subordinate, Lt. Jack Revill, worked on “espionage and subversive activities” in Dallas in conjunction with the FBI and military intelligence, the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU) being one conduit. The pilot car of the motorcade was driven by Deputy Police Chief George Lumpkin, also a member of the local Army Intelligence Reserve Unit. Lumpkin, a friend of Jack Crichton, later told the HSCA that he had been consulted by the Secret Service regarding motorcade security, and that his input had ruled out another route.35 Also in the pilot car was Lieutenant Colonel George Whitmeyer, the commander of all Army Reserve units in East Texas, although Whitmeyer was not on the approved police list to ride in that car. Chronically short-handed, the Secret Service routinely worked with Army intelligence. Lt. Colonel Jones “believed” he opened a file on Oswald in mid-1963 after Oswald’s arrest in New Orleans. The HSCA investigation determined that the 112th Military Intelligence Group office in Dallas had possessed a file on “Harvey Lee Oswald,” who was “procommunist,” had traveled to Russia, and had been involved in pro-Castro activities. This military file gave Oswald’s address as 605 Elsbeth, the same error found on Dallas Police Lt. Jack Revill’s list. After the assassination, Jones called FBI SAIC (Dallas) Gordon Shanklin and summarized the military documents on file for A.J. Hidell (Oswald’s alias). The “after action” reports from military intelligence agents who performed liaison functions with the Secret Service in Dallas were maintained in Oswald’s file. To Jones’ knowledge neither the FBI nor any law enforcement agency ever requested a copy of the military intelligence file on Oswald. Remarkably, neither the FBI, Secret Service, CIA, nor the Warren Commission ever interviewed him. Jones told the HSCA that no one ordered him to withhold information. The Department of Defense never gave Oswald’s military intelligence file to the Warren Commission despite repeated requests. They could not share it with the HSCA since it was “routinely destroyed” in 1973. Captain James Powell initially maintained that he was “off” the day of the assassination,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:360:c1bed544c043", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 654, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 361, "text": "copy of the military intelligence file on Oswald.

They could not share it with the HSCA since it was “routinely destroyed” in 1973. Captain James Powell initially maintained that he was “off” the day of the assassination, and that he just decided to view the motorcade and take pictures. Powell, a trained army intelligence photographer, just happened to take several photos of Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination and of the TSBD seconds after the shooting.36 He claims to have rushed up to the sixth floor with Dallas sheriffs. Powell told researcher Penn Jones that he “worked with the sheriff ’s deputies at the TSBD for about six or eight minutes.” None of his other photos have been published and the government did not interview him in depth.37 After the assassination, Dallas Police Lieutenant Jack Revill drove an “Army intelligence man” or OSI (Air Force Intelligence) agent back to his office from the TSBD,38 shortly before he met FBI agent James Hosty. This was shortly after Revill had organized the search of the TSBD, which discovered the Mannlicher-Carcano, where Powell and Deputy Chief George Lumpkin were located.39 On the evening of the assassination Lieutenant Revill’s assistant, a detective from Dallas criminal intelligence, Don Stringfellow, falsely notified 112th Military Intelligence Group that Oswald revealed he had defected to Cuba in 1959 and that he was a card-carrying Communist. Jack Crichton, Commander of the 488th Military Intelligence Detachment, called Ilya Mamantov, from a CIA-subsidized “church,” to head “a local Army Intelligence Unit”40 to translate for Marina Oswald. Coincidentally two minutes later, Deputy Chief Lumpkin, a member of the Army Intelligence reserve, also called Mamantov with the same request. FBI agent and former Marine officer, Oliver “Buck” Revell, assisted the FBI investigation of Oswald’s military connections after the assassination. He conducted a detailed inquiry into Oswald’s military background at the Marine Corps facility in New River, N.C., although there is no record of Oswald being there. Then after advancing to the number three man in the FBI, Revell became in charge of criminal investigations and to follow up on the findings and recommendations of the HSCA. By 1991, he became SAIC of the FBI’s Dallas Division with the responsibility to conduct further investigation into the Kennedy case as warranted. He was a reliable guardian. The HSCA however, concluded that the military’s “routine’ destruction of the Oswald’s military files “extremely troublesome,” especially when viewed in light of the Department of Defense’s failure to make the file available to the Warren Commission.

Despite the credibility of Jones’s testimony, without access to this file, the question of Oswald’s possible affiliation with military intelligence could not be fully resolved. Congressman Richardson Preyer, Chair of the HSCA, expressed profound frustration at the destruction of these files when I interviewed him in 1990. Some FBI files from 1959-1964 were somehow held at the U.S. Army Investigative Records Repository, until the HSCA requested files (classified Secret) on Loran Hall. Hall was an associate of General Walker (fired by JFK) and oilman H.L. Hunt in a range of radical right causes. General Walker was also closely associated with Guy Banister, Joseph Milteer, Lt. General Pedro Del Valle (ret.) and Colonel William Gale (ret.). The ARRB experienced similar frustrations. The ONI twice informed the ARRB that they had no relevant files. The third attempt by the ARRB staff seemed promising. They met with an ONI team directed by Lieutenant Commander Terri Pike, who was somehow belatedly informed on March 7, 1997, that they were tasked to turn over relevant files. Pike dove into the job and had identified where the record collections were held. She reported to the ARRB within 2 months that her team had already located about 125 cubic feet of documents related to the ARRB requests and that ONI had identified about 950 cubic feet of records which might be related. Pike told ARRB staffers 4/21/97 , that most of the relevant records were discovered “by accident” since they were misfiled in boxes they should not have been in. When the ARRB next contacted Pike, she informed them that she had been “relieved of her leadership on the project.” Pike then faced court-martial charges over “fraudulent” travel expenses. The final certification of compliance to the ARRB stated that the ONI was unable to find any relevant file for the Director of ONI from 1959-1964. ONI also acknowledged that there were additional ONI records which were not reviewed for assassination records, but that they would be reviewed under Executive Order 12958. Deputy Chief of the Secret Service, Paul Paterni served in the OSS during WW ІІ in Milan, Italy, with James Angleton, CIA Counter Intelligence Chief, and Ray Rocco, his loyal assistant at CIA-CIC. Paterni was active behind the scenes with evidence after the assassination. Paterni’s good friend, Chief Inspector Michael Torina, noted that “Paterni [also] served in the military reserve from the late 1930’s through the mid-1960s.41 Paterni’s assistant, and later his replacement, N. Jackson Krill, was also a former member of the OSS.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:362:24df82c541c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 656, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 363, "text": "Secret Service, Paul Paterni served in the OSS during WW ІІ in Milan, Italy, with James Angleton, CIA Counter Intelligence Chief, and Ray Rocco, his loyal assistant at CIA-CIC.

Within this context, military actions surrounding the autopsy seem more problematic. Why was the regular autopsy doctor at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Dr. Karnei, told by Admiral Gallaway that he would not perform the autopsy? Why two days afterward did Dr. Karnei sign a pledge to not talk about the autopsy for 10 years? Why after 10 years was the time limit extended for another 15 years? Why was Dr. Karnei not questioned by the Warren Commission? Why did Commander James Humes burn his notes on Kennedy’s autopsy on November 24, 1963? Why were Admiral Kenney and Admiral Galloway, General White and possibly General LeMay, and the Secret Service in the autopsy room at Bethesda Naval Hospital? Does this account for the variance of the Bethesda medical reports, with those descriptions of doctors from Parkland Hospital? Why were qualified civilian experts excluded from examining the body? Why was the location of the back wound relocated to the lower neck region? Why are the two reports regarding the removal of an additional bullet from the body not integrated into the final reports? Why, contrary to standard medical practice, wasn’t the brain sectioned during supplemental examination two weeks later? Why did Colonel Pierre Finck testify to New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison in 1969 that he was told by Admiral Galloway not to examine the neck wound during the autopsy? Why did they deny Colonel Finck the opportunity to examine the clothing? Why hasn’t Admiral Burkley, the President’s private physician, who was present at the autopsy, ever been called to testify? CIA Executive Action Operation 40, remains perplexing. By 1963 Bishop worked under CIA officers Desmond FitzGerald and David Phillips organizing anti-Castro groups in Miami. Colonel Bishop admitted to reporter Dick Russell that they were aware of the assassination plot to kill the president. Bishop claimed that Jimmy Hoffa arranged the assassination through CIA operative, and anti-Castro Cuban, Rolando Masferrer42 “or that’s what he was to say, or that was what he was told to say.” Another anti-Castro Cuban, Felipe Vidal Santiago, who claimed that he worked with Bishop, recounts events differently. When Vidal Santiago was arrested by Cuba for acts of sabotage in 1964, he recalled Bishop’s actions in November of 1963.l Santiago remembered Bishop inviting him to Dallas to meet wealthy people financing anti-Castro actions.

Santiago said that he had been informed of Kennedy’s effort to open dialogue with Castro in December of 1962, and he alerted his cohorts of this betrayal.43 Recall that Gene Wheaton, military intelligence operative (OSI and Army CID) told ARRB investigator Anne Buttimer that senior CIA office Carl Jenkins had told him that Jenkins had trained the Cubans that killed Kennedy. Jenkins was a paramilitary organizer for the Bay of Pigs and AM/WORLD, and, along with Wheaton, another CIA-military nexus. Unfortunately, the ARRB somehow did not fully investigate Wheaton’s assertions. Also, recall that Antonio Veciana, co-founder of the violent anti-Castro Alpha 66, had been an asset of both the CIA and U.S. Army counter-intelligence starting in October 1962. Veciana was assigned code number DUP 748 on 1/30/63. In September of 1963, in Dallas, Veciana saw Oswald meeting with CIA officer Maurice Bishop, a man that he and others have identified as David Phillips. Phillips was in charge of psychological warfare – an expert on propaganda operations. Why has Paul O’Connor, the medical assistant in Bethesda during the autopsy, stated that Admiral Burkley gave the order to Lt. Colonel Finck not to probe the back wound? Four days after the autopsy, why did Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon of the Navy, warn those involved in the autopsy not to discuss the proceedings with anyone, lest they be subject to court-martial? Why did Colonel Finck receive directives by telephone, from the White House and through the Naval Medical School in Bethesda, not to discuss the subject beyond the Warren Report, in September 1964?⁴⁵ Why did Colonel Finck’s autopsy notes go missing? Why was Dallas FBI agent James Hosty ordered by Bill Sullivan, the FBI liaison to the National Security Council, not to cooperate with the Dallas police in their questioning of Oswald, less than three hours after Oswald’s arrest? Why did the Army “routinely” destroy many of their files on Oswald in 1973, a matter the HSCA found “extremely troublesome?” Photographic evidence suggests that General Ed Lansdale might have been in Dealey Plaza during the assassination.

His military title was largely a cover.46 Why was Lt. Commander William Pitzer, head of the Navy Audio Visual Unit at Bethesda Hospital, who took the autopsy photographs, and had a 16 mm videotape of the autopsy, visited periodically by military personnel and told never to discuss what he had seen during the examination – for reasons of national security? Bethesda X-ray technician Jerol Custer, who was present at the autopsy while Pitzer was filming it, has stated that military men “flipped out” upon seeing him filming.47 In 1966 Lt. Commander Pitzer was due to retire after 28 years in the service, to start a $45, 000 a year job with network television, and write a book about his experiences. Strangely, on October 29, 1966, Pitzer was found dead from what authorities said was a self-inflicted wound to the head with a .45 caliber pistol. FBI tests indicated that: 1) no powder burns were found on Pitzer’s head; 2) the paraffin test “reflected no substance characteristic of, or which could be associated with, gunpowder or gunpowder residue”; 3) the latent finger prints in the room where Pitzer’s body was found did not match either the Navy investigators or Pitzer.48 Mrs. Pitzer was refused access to the autopsy of her husband by the Navy. She was told by several captains and an admiral not to talk about it. ARRB releases in 1998 included documents showing that the HSCA had tested the Navy camera, which was supposed to have taken JFK’s autopsy photographs, and it failed the authenticity tests. In a sworn interview with Sandra Kay Spencer, who developed the JFK autopsy photos in the archives, she stated that the photos are not the ones she developed. Autopsy photographer John Stringer similarly disavowed the authenticity of the supplemental autopsy brain photographs49 that he was supposed to have taken. Autopsy witness Dr. Karnes stated to the ARRB that he was sure he remembered an autopsy photograph taken with a probe in President Kennedy’s body. Robert Knudsen, the White House photographer involved with the processing of the autopsy pictures, was frustrated that no pictures with probes were in the Archives. His interview with the HSCA was suppressed, and released by the ARRB. Also, an internal CBS memorandum published by the ARRB noted that Dr. Humes told a CBS employee that a photo was taken of the body with a probe in it. Lt.

Colonel Daniel Marvin asserts that in 1965, as a Green Beret captain trained for assassinations, he was assigned by Colonel Clarence Patton to meet a “Company” man for a mission to assassinate a Naval Officer before his retirement – a Lieutenant Commander William Bruce Pitzer. Marvin refused the mission and states that Captain David Vanek spoke next with the “Company” man. Lt. Colonel Marvin has never been able to get in touch with Captain Vanek, and the Navy denies that Vanek ever served.50 Marvin, however, saved old military orders which indicated that he and Vanek did indeed serve together. In December 1963 Marvin was a specialist training on assassinations at Fort Bragg where he claims the assassination of President Kennedy was discussed to exemplify a classic program of assassination. Maps of Dealey Plaza were used to show crossfire, and a cover-up plan was discussed. Marvin’s book, Expendable Elite, reveals his CIA assignment to assassinate Prince Sihanouk, the Crown Prince of Cambodia in 1966. When Marvin aborted the mission, the CIA sent an ARVN force to destroy Marvin’s Special Forces camps for standing up to the CIA. The evening of November 23rd a desperate Oswald seemingly tried to call John Hurt in Raleigh, N.C, formerly of Army Counterintelligence in WWII. Hurt didn’t answer. Two telephone operators working the switchboard, which controlled, among other Dallas city offices, the jail, perhaps point to another piece of the puzzle. Mrs. Alveeta Treon was told by co-worker Mrs. Louise Swinney that their supervisor told them to assist law enforcement officials in listening to a call that Lee Oswald would be making soon. Two men that Ms. Treon thinks may have been Secret Service agents entered the switchboard area. At about 10 : 45 p.m . the call came through and Mrs. Swinney handled it and wrote down the number Oswald was calling. Mrs. Treon said that Mrs. Swinney disconnected Oswald without trying to put the call through. Mrs. Swinney left work at 11 : 00pm and Mrs. Treon retrieved the paper notation of Oswald’s call. Two John Hurts resided in Raleigh; John D. Hurt was possibly the intended recipient, according to HSCA chair Robert Blakey.

Was Oswald calling a “cut out” for assistance?51 Chairman Earl Warren consulted with the Defense Department to secure some historians to write the final Warren Report. Dr. Alfred Goldberg from the Air Force and Mr. Cokery with the Army were recommended by Dr. Rudolph Winnacker, a former analyst for the OSS and then Chief of the Historical Division of the Pentagon. Goldberg and Cokely were major authors of the final report – a report that clearly does not reflect the 26 volumes of Warren Commission Hearings. Rogue factions of the military and CIA, in both Cuba and Vietnam, undercut some presidential policies. By 1963 Kennedy had both ordered anti-Castro Cubans in Alpha 66 to cease their attacks on Cuba and he had secretly appealed to Henry Luce, who was a major financial backer, yet the attacks were stepped up. Indeed the raids were being tolerated by mid-level ranks of the Navy, and the U.S. Army was using Alpha 66 and DRE (Cuban Student Directorate) operationally. Kennedy got an early copy of the book Seven Days in May, which portrayed a military coup in America and he encouraged Hollywood director John Frankenheimer to turn the book into a movie. According to Arthur Schlesinger, “The president said the first thing I’m going to tell my successor is “Don’t trust the military men – even on military matters.”52 The Defense Department requested a copy of the script for “consideration,” as military censors called their process. Frankenheimer refused. Kennedy then cooperated with the filming, which included scenes at the White House and staged riots on Pennsylvania Ave. President Nixon also confronted deeply distrustful anti-communist Joint Chiefs, who disagreed with the ABM and SALT Treaties, opposed his withdrawal from Vietnam, and his openings to the Soviet Union and China. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was viewed as soft on communism, and they opposed the risky support for Pakistan against India which involved nuclear weapons. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, former Chief of Naval Operations, wrote that the Nixon Administration was “inimical to the security of the United States. The Administration “reflected Henry Kissinger’s world view: that the dynamics of history are on the side of the Soviet Union … (In Watch PXIV) Zumwalt also feared their “deliberate, systematic efforts to conceal their real policies about the most critical matters of national security.” One response from the Joint Chiefs was to spy on Kissinger.

Admiral Moorer, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, directed Rear Admiral Robert Welander and Rear Admiral Rembrant Robinson to spy on the NSC. Navy Yeoman, Charles Radford, the liaison between the NSC and Joint Chiefs, stole more than five thousand pages of highly classified documents from late 1970 through 1971. Radford stated that his “superiors” believed that Kissinger’s foreign policy was “catastrophic … a conspiracy of the CFR and the Rockefeller family to win Soviet cooperation in creating Rockefeller domination over the world’s currency.”53 When columnist Jack Anderson revealed “Nixon’s Tilt toward Pakistan,” the White House knew that the leak must have come from an NSC meeting of the Washington Special Action Group (12/3/71). Pakistan was being used as a pathway for secret negotiations with China. Revisionist scholarship clarified the context for the deepening of distrust. The Pakistani relief to East Pakistan after the devastating cyclone of 1970 proved far from adequate, and the East Pakistani candidate won the national election weeks later. When West Pakistanis would not accept the results, the East Pakistanis generated a national strike. West Pakistan invaded and killed some 200,000, while around 6 million fled to India. Nixon remained silent to what the U.S. consulate saw as “Selective Genocide.” India prepared for war to stop the refugee crisis but Pakistan attacked pre-emptively.54 Nixon secretly sent weapons to Pakistan after it invaded India. He circumvented Congress and law by using intermediary countries. Nixon then moved the 7th fleet into the Bay of Bengal, which provoked the Soviets to move their fleet to protect their ally India – rapidly escalating a regional crisis. The White House investigation of the NSC leak led to uncovering the JCS spy operation. Admiral Robert Welander later admitted to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman that he had used Radford and had delivered the documents to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Thomas Moorer. Welander also implicated General Al Haig. The so-called Pentagon’s man in the White House, Haig, then Kissinger’s deputy, worked with Welander and Robinson but said nothing.55 Nixon shrewdly decided to forego an election year public investigation of this espionage, which would have been embarrassing and impolitic. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt wrote that Nixon and Kissinger were almost treasonous and that Kissinger was a Soviet sympathizer. Retired Admiral Chester Ward claimed that Kissinger was a Soviet agent. Nixon also angered many in the CIA when he fired DCI Richard Helms during Watergate, and charged his appointee James Schlesinger to “clean house.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:368:3c011d87320e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 662, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 369, "text": "with Welander and Robinson but said nothing.55 Nixon shrewdly decided to forego an election year public investigation of this espionage, which would have been embarrassing and impolitic.

Nixon also angered many in the CIA when he fired DCI Richard Helms during Watergate, and charged his appointee James Schlesinger to “clean house.” Schlesinger fired more than 1000 members of the clandestine service.56 Military connections also surfaced during the Watergate scandal as well. Watergate burglars Frank Sturgis and James McCord had previously worked with Army Intelligence as well as for the CIA. Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward learned that McCord in 1971 was a member of an Army Reserve unit in Washington attached to the office of Emergency Preparedness. A fellow reservist said McCord was tasked to compile lists of “radicals” and develop contingency plans for censorship of the news media and the U.S. mail in time of war.57 McCord, recruited to the Plumbers by his old CIA colleague E. Howard Hunt, had worked with the Pentagon since 1948 with a top secret ^(α)Q^(′) clearance (When a C-117 cargo plane was shot down over Azerbaijan in 1958 for spying, McCord was tasked to debrief the passengers).58 Recall that McCord headed security for the “Plumbers,” yet somehow taped a door horizontally in the Watergate hotel, which directly led to the police discovery of the operation. During the trial McCord was outspoken regarding the innocence of the CIA. Watergate burglar and CIA asset Eugenio Martinez has written that he thought their arrest in the Watergate Hotel was a set-up. Bob Woodward’s military background and connections are noteworthy. He was first commissioned as an ensign on the USS Wright, “the floating Pentagon,” the National Security ship, where the Cabinet and the President could meet in the event of a nuclear war. Woodward had a “crypto” clearance. Admiral Welander, the leader of the JCS liaison office at the NSC, had been Woodward’s commanding officer on the USS Fox. Admiral Moorer, chair of the JCS, was Woodward’s commander at the Pentagon where Woodward worked as the Communications Duty Officer, directing messages to the NSC and the White House. Later, while working at the White House, Woodward briefed General Haig on the developments at the Pentagon. Woodward never revealed these relationships to his readers.59 General Al Haig, Nixon’s domineering chief of staff, consistently misled Nixon. Haig’s aide, Alexander Butterfield, who alerted the Congress to the existence of the White House tapes, was a former high-level briefing officer for Naval Intelligence. Bob Woodward was also an old military friend of Butterfield and White House lawyer Fred Buzhardt.60 According to Nixon special assistant Steven Bull, Haig once declared, “If you think that the president can run the country without Al Haig", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:369:faa08c8094f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 663, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 370, "text": "these relationships to his readers.59 General Al Haig, Nixon’s domineering chief of staff, consistently misled Nixon.

Bob Woodward was also an old military friend of Butterfield and White House lawyer Fred Buzhardt.60 According to Nixon special assistant Steven Bull, Haig once declared, “If you think that the president can run the country without Al Haig … you are mistaken.”61 Tony Ulasewicz, who provided private security for Nixon wrote, “Haig was turning against the President in the final days before Nixon resigned … Haig ordered the U.S. Army’s Criminal Investigation Command (CIC) to conduct a high priority investigation” to determine if Nixon accepted cash gifts from Asian leaders or from organized crime.62 Haig told Nixon’s aide Charles Colson, “If the President’s going to be impeached, better he go down himself, than take the whole intelligence apparatus with him.” Perhaps it was no coincidence that General Haig pressured Nixon to resign, after threatening Vice President Spiro Agnew to “Go quietly or else.”63 Many authors think Haig was one of the sources of “Deep Throat,” along with FBI associate director Mark Felt, and CIA asset Bob Bennett. Bennett’s PR firm (Robert Mullen Company) was a CIA front which employed E. Howard Hunt. Bennett’s CIA case officer, Martin Lukoskie, wrote a Memorandum for the Record to the House Armed Services Committee’s 1973, “Inquiring into the Alleged Involvement of the CIA in the Watergate and Ellsberg Matters,” which admitted tasking Bennett to “kill off any revelation” of CIA involvement in the Mullen Company. The rest of the Memorandum attempted to convince reporters to not pursue a “Seven Days in May” scenario that included the CIA. CIA officer Lukoskie’s boss, Eric Eisenstat, wrote in a memo to CIA DDP that Bennett “has been feeding stories to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post with the understanding that there is no attribution to Bennett’…64 The release of remaining Watergate documents might still clarify which factions generated what was probably a palace coup. Similarly, the remarkable number of missing military and CIA files could still clarify the assassination of President Kennedy. Not only did Army Intelligence “routinely” destroy their files, but the NSA claims that none of their intelligence documents contain anything significant to the JFK assassination. The Office of Naval Intelligence claims that they have no records for the ONI Director from 1959-1964. Eighteen staff “D” CIA dispatches to the NSA are not retrievable, because supposedly they lack a file number. The ONI Defection File, identified as an assassination record by Navy Commander T.

Eisenhower era reports on assassinations of foreign leaders, previously available, are now missing from the National Archives. Also, now missing is Oswald’s CIA Office of Security file, volume 5, which was last seen by the HSCA. Khrushchev received a military autopsy, which ran counter to the civilian doctors who first treated him. Imagine that later one of the autopsy doctors admitted that a Soviet general ran the autopsy, and that this doctor said he was ordered not to track the path of the bullet. That crucial autopsy known to be taken went missing, that trained medical witnesses disputed what was shown in those that remained, that the official autopsy camera went missing after an investigation failed to match it to the photographs. Imagine it was Russia where the security services destroyed evidence linking themselves with the purported killer, who was declared to be a “rabid capitalist,” but who seemed to be surrounded for the last year of his life by KGB operatives. That secret evidence finally revealed that the purported killer had been impersonated in a supposed conversation with CIA agents. But Khrushchev’s successor, without revealing the impersonation, had led those investigating the crime to think that the alleged assassin had indeed made the disturbing calls, and that there might be a nuclear war with America if this got out… Take the single bullet theory, the killing of the alleged assassin while in police custody… including that the murder was followed by a major expansion of a war that secret documents later showed Khrushchev had ordered to be wound down. It would be obvious that his political enemies, including the KGB, killed Khrushchev. The basic facts reflect the reality of the Kennedy assassination, but imagining that the U.S. military and the CIA may have been complicit created cognitive dissonance for most Americans – especially with the mainstream media burying the lead.

L that he took a step down from Senate Majority leader to serve as Vice-President for a man he did not like. But by 1963, John-son’s public scandals presented the very real possibility that he might be oned. While these motives were strong, the evidence linking Johnson at the planning stages of the assassination seems circumstantial, yet his role as an accomplice to the cover-up is clear. Johnson ordered the seizure of all evidence after the assassination. His rapid order to clean the presidential limousine and to launder Connally’s clothes constitutes destruction of evidence. He created the Warren Commission to head off independent Texas and Congressional investigations, and directed it to report to him. He tried to influence the Commission and called certain Commissioners regularly during the hearings. Johnson supported the “national security” classification for more than two million pages of the Warren Commission and related documents until 2029. By mid-1963 Johnson was seriously concerned about two senate investigations of his top aide Bobby Baker. The Senate Rules Committee, in November of 1963, was investigating Baker’s role in the award of a $7 billion contract for the TFX fighter plane to General Dynamics. Baker’s business associate, Don Reynolds, had testified about a big lobbyists’ sex party in New York, and a $100, 000 payoff to Johnson for his role in securing the Fort Worth TFX contract. Baker was financially connected with Carlos Marcello as well as Fred Black, one of mobster Johnny Roselli’s close friends and the next-door neighbor to LBJ. This and numerous bribery allegations seriously threatened Johnson’s political career. Johnson’s benefactors in oil, banking and defense spending feared the implications if LBJ resigned. Recall the Justice Department and IRS were examining Baker’s Las Vegas connections to Meyer Lansky associate Ed Levison as well as Ben Siegelbaum, a Hoffa ally. Meanwhile RFK was examining Johnson’s reputed dependence on Marcello’s support, which helped push Johnson to kill anti-racketeering legislation. Not surprisingly, Baker’s testimony was ended by the news that Kennedy had been shot. Johnson’s long-time mistress, Madeline Brown, has claimed in interviews and in her book, Texas in the Morning, that Johnson knew of the assassination attempt more than a week before it occurred, and that he approved of it. Brown maintained that Johnson met with J. Edgar Hoover, Texas oilman Clint Murchison, and others at Murchison’s house the evening prior to the assassination. When LBJ arrived, the assembled then reconvened in a private room. After the meeting, Johnson supposedly said “the Kennedys won’t bother me anymore.” Although Brown’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:372:a9bc1d6b6e72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 666, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 373, "text": "claimed in interviews and in her book, Texas in the Morning, that Johnson knew of the assassination attempt more than a week before it occurred, and that he approved of it.

When LBJ arrived, the assembled then reconvened in a private room. After the meeting, Johnson supposedly said “the Kennedys won’t bother me anymore.” Although Brown’s story has changed over the years regarding who attended this gathering, the essence of her assertions has been constant. Barr McClellan, a Johnson attorney working with Edward Clark’s law firm, has stated and written that two of his associates had told him that Clark had Kennedy assassinated. McClellan was told this story by both attorney Jon Coats as well as by Johnson’s long-time business attorney Don Thomas.1 (McClellan’s son was the press spokesperson for President G. W. Bush). Perhaps foreknowledge and some level of complicity somehow evolved into hyperbole in the minds of McClellan’s partners that Clark was responsible. Johnson’s top political aide, Billy Sol Estes, testified in a Texas court in 1984 after release from prison that Johnson was involved in eight political murders, including President Kennedy. Briefly, the first of these alleged murders was Henry Marshall, a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector exploring Estes’ business. Marshall supposedly died by shooting himself five times in the chest with a .22 bolt action rifle, on his farm. No blood samples or fingerprints were taken from the truck or murder weapon. Carbon monoxide was found in Marshall’s body. Marshall’s family knew of no motive. When the case was reopened in May 1962 the doctor who examined the exhumed body, Joseph Jachimczyk, said “I believe this was not a suicide.”2 While this portion of con-man Estes’ testimony may be plausible, the rest seems speculative or vindictive. In 1963 John Connally, LBJ‘s protégé, convinced JFK of the need to campaign in Texas. Kennedy placed the Dallas trip, which was announced April 23, 1963, in Johnson’s hands. Less than 45 days later, Kennedy, Johnson, and Governor Connally confirmed the trip at the Cortez Hotel in Texas. Kennedy advanceman Jerry Bruno disagreed with the Texas planners over the proposed motorcade route, since it created risks for President Kennedy. In late October, Bruno flew to Dallas to discuss more details of the trip. Before meeting Connally, Bruno met with Texas Senator Yarborough who warned him that, “Johnson and Connally would be … after John Kennedy in a minute if they thought they could get away with it.”3 Bruno and Connally got into a heated dispute regarding the proposed route, which caused Connally to call the White House in Bruno’s presence.

A fiery argument ensued, and Johnson left the presidential suite “like a pistol,” looking furious.5 Kennedy had stayed with previous plans, which had Johnson riding with his enemy, Senator Yarborough, rather than his former close aide, Governor Connally. Johnson’s motorcade seatmate Senator Ralph Yarborough reported that he smelled gunpowder near the grassy knoll. He also stated that at the time of the assassination Johnson had his ear up to a small walkie-talkie with the sound “turned down real low.” Johnson refused to supply a sworn affidavit of what he had seen. He signed an unsworn statement, which explained little about what he saw, heard, or smelled.6 Hoover: No, that’s one angle that’s very confusing for this reason. We have up here the tape and photograph of the man who was at the Soviet Embassy, using Oswald’s name. That picture and tape do not correspond to this man’s voice or appearance. In other words, it appears that there is a second person who was at the Soviet Embassy. Authors Penn Jones, Forgive My Grief, and Gary Shaw, Cover-up, report that less than 24 hours after the assassination Johnson called Dallas police Homicide Chief Will Fritz and said, “You have got your man.” Johnson directed his aide Cliff Carter to call Dallas D.A. Henry Wade and ordered him not to allege a conspiracy. Wade said Carter called three or four times and said that it “would hurt foreign relations if I alleged a conspiracy … and whether I could prove it or not … I was to charge Oswald with plain murder.”7 Police Chief Jesse Curry, State Attorney General Wagoner Carr and Captain Will Fritz also received similar calls from Cliff Carter.8 Fritz recalled receiving a number of calls Friday evening and Saturday morning. Further, Johnson called Parkland Hospital to obtain a deathbed confession from Lee Harvey Oswald. According to Dr. Charles Crenshaw, one of the surgeons working on Oswald, LBJ stated “I want a deathbed confession from the accused assassin.

I will expect full cooperation on this matter.”9 Parkland Hospital switchboard operation Phyllis Bartlett confirmed Johnson’s call to Crenshaw. The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large; and that the evidence was such that he would have been convicted at trial. Speculation about Oswald’s motivation should be cut off, and we should have some basics for rebutting the thought that this was a Communist conspiracy or a right-wing conspiracy to blame it on the Communists.… We need something to head off public speculation or congressional hearings of the wrong sort. Johnson’s good friend and political crony for twenty years, J. Edgar Hoover, was the major source of investigation for the Warren Commission. Johnson regularly called and met with Hoover during the life of the Commission. Hoover had been helpful in deflecting investigations regarding Johnson’s ties with Mafioso Carlos Marcello as well as the ties Johnson’s top aide, Bobby Baker, also had with Marcello and other Mafiosi.10 The day after the President was assassinated, the Justice Department stopped getting information from the FBI on the Bobby Baker investigation.11 CIA contract agent George de Mohrenschildt’s letters to Johnson while he was Vice-President, as well as Johnson’s relationships with Clint Murchison and other Texas oilmen, both warrant further research. Recall that George and his wife Jeanne befriended the Oswald’s; making introductions, driving them around, and helping Lee get jobs and apartments. George was friends with the CIA man in Dallas, J. Walton Moore, who worked with the Domestic Contacts Service (DCS), which debriefed Americans returning from abroad. De Mohrenschildt and Devine also met with C. Frank Stone III, chief of operations for the European section of the CIA’s clandestine wing along with M.C. Joseph Charles, the manager of Bangui Commercialese D’ Haiti. This meeting was supposedly about “sisal” (rope), and a subsequent meeting was supposedly to get U.S. support to overthrow “Papa Doc” Duvalier.

Johnson’s role might have been clarified by the first draft of William Manchester’s The Death of a President, which mentioned the fight between Kennedy and Johnson over the fateful trip to Texas, the dispute between them in Texas, and Kennedy staff suspicions about Johnson; however, the Kennedy clan filed a lawsuit to stop the publication of the book. Perhaps this version was seen as harmful to Robert Kennedy’s political future or to the future of the Democratic Party. The lawsuit was settled with all parties agreeing to an “approved” version of the book.13 Recall that Johnson crony D.H. Byrd owned the TSBD, and had started the national Civil Air Patrol that David Ferrie and Oswald had worked with. The military contractor Byrd had worked closely with General Le-May, as well as Texas oilmen and businessmen who had generously funded Johnson. Byrd’s membership with the Dallas Petroleum Club and the “Suite F^(″) group also made him cronies with H. L. Hunt, Sid Richardson, Jack Crichton, Gordon McLendon, William Pawley, Herman Brown (of Brown and Root) and Robert Kerr (Kerr-McGee Oil Industries). Johnson regularly met and called Warren Commission members Russell, Dulles, and Ford, while the Commission was still gathering evidence, as well as with Texas Attorney General Waggoner Carr, who still strongly supports the Warren Commission findings. Johnson’s other actions raise suspicions regarding these calls and meetings as well. Johnson’s appointment of fellow Texan, Ramsey Clark, as Attorney General, and Clark’s efforts to withhold basic evidence regarding this assassination, including autopsy x-rays and photographs, was clarified by the AARB. During the Garrison investigation in New Orleans, the Clark Commission (1968) not only echoed the Warren Commission, but it also remarkably cleared Clay Shaw of any involvement in the assassination, even though Shaw’s name did not even appear in the Warren Commission Report. Evelyn Lincoln, the trusted personal secretary of President Kennedy, has stated that Hoover blackmailed Kennedy to offer the VP position to Johnson. She says that she was in the hotel room during the 1960 convention when John and Robert Kennedy were agonizing over how to deal with Hoover’s call on behalf of Johnson, as well as Hoover’s knowledge of JFK’s compromising extramarital affairs.14 Noted Johnson biographer Robert Caro recounted the embarrassments and humiliation of his vice presidency. He concluded that LBJ developed “an utter ruthlessness in destroying obstacles in his path, and a seemingly bottomless capacity for deceit, deception and betrayal” in part to overcome his childhood suffering.15", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:376:2bd66d30d3c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 670, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 377, "text": "the hotel room during the 1960 convention when John and Robert Kennedy were agonizing over how to deal with Hoover’s call on behalf of Johnson, as well as Hoover’s knowledge of JFK’s compromising extramarital affairs.14 Noted Johnson biographer Robert Caro recounted the embarrassments and humiliation of his vice presidency.

Reporters are puppets.… They simply respond to the pull of the most powerful strings.… Every story is always slanted to win the favor of someone who sits higher up.… There is only one sure way of getting favorable stories from reporters and that is to keep their daily bread – the information, the stories, the plans and details they need for their work in your hands, so that you can give it out when and to whom you want.16 Amid the tense international setting in 1960, candidate John Ken-nedy campaigned as a cold warrior, hammering the Eisenhower Administration for allowing a “missile gap” and for being overly tolerant of Castro. As president he appeared as hawk and dove, idealist and pragmatist. He sponsored the Peace Corps as well as the Green Berets. He called for respect for Third World nationalism, yet he intervened in Vietnam and Cuba. He appealed for liberalized trade, yet he supported many protectionist measures. He proclaimed that “America should never fear to negotiate,” yet he often used military rather than diplomatic options. He generally opposed neo-colonialism and after the Cuban Missile Crisis he took major risks to end the Cold War. Chester Bowles, one of Kennedy’s top foreign policy advisors, noted numerous decisions Kennedy made against a majority of his advisors: refusing to invade Cuba during the Bay of Pigs disaster; initiating an Alliance for Progress; refusing to intervene in the Dominican Republic following the assassination of Trujillo; refusing to introduce ground troops into Laos; refusing to escalate in Vietnam; backing U.N. policy in the Congo; not attacking the Soviets during the Cuban Missile crisis, and backing India in its disputes with China and Pakistan.1 The fires of nationalism are ablaze.… A Middle East Command operating without the cooperation and support of the Middle Eastern countries … would intensify every anti-western force now active in the area, [and] from a military standpoint would be doomed to failure. The very sands of the desert rise to oppose the imposition of outside control on the destinies of these proud people… Our intervention on behalf of England’s oil interests in Iran, directed more at the preservation of interests outside of Iran than at Iran’s own development.… Our failure to deal effectively after three years with the terrible tragedy of more than 700,000 Arab refugees", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:377:cdb2633c9ebb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 671, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 378, "text": "force now active in the area, [and] from a military standpoint would be doomed to failure.

When Kennedy decided to flaunt the massive U.S. nuclear superiority in number of nuclear weapons and delivery systems through the speech of an aide in October, the Soviets responded by detonating a 30-megaton bomb followed by a 50-megaton bomb – far larger than anything in the U.S. arsenal. The rising Cold War tensions reinforced the American need to respond to Cuba. The Kennedys launched Operation Mongoose, a campaign of terror to wreck the Cuban economy and possibly assassinate Castro. Robert Kennedy planned a “policy of sabotage, general disorder, run and operated by the Cubans themselves.” The CIA program called JMWAVE, located in South Florida, included 600 CIA officers, nearly 5000 contractors, and the third largest navy in the Caribbean, led by counterinsurgency expert General Ed Lansdale. By March 1962 Lansdale was asking the Joint Chiefs for pretexts to invade Cuba. General Lyman Lemnitzer directed Brigadier General William Craig to generate a list of possible provocations, which was code-named Operation Northwoods. The list included: a “Remember the Maine” type of incident, hijacking attempts against American aircraft to be pinned on the Cuban government,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:378:cf5fb6e21954", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 672, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 379, "text": "South Florida, included 600 CIA officers, nearly 5000 contractors, and the third largest navy in the Caribbean, led by counterinsurgency expert General Ed Lansdale.

General Lyman Lemnitzer directed Brigadier General William Craig to generate a list of possible provocations, which was code-named Operation Northwoods. The list included: a “Remember the Maine” type of incident, hijacking attempts against American aircraft to be pinned on the Cuban government, a “terror” campaign against Cuban refugees, including sinking a boat-load of refugees headed to Florida, a series of well-coordinated incidents around Guantanamo to give the appearance of having been carried out by hostile Cuban forces; staging a Cuban government shoot down of a civilian airliner. These actions, along with U.S. efforts to suspend Cuba’s membership in the OAS, as well as three military exercises in the Caribbean, contributed to the Soviet perception that action was needed to defend Cuba. Khrushchev gambled that placing middle-range ballistic missiles MRBMs and warheads into Cuba would deter an attack on themselves and Cuba. He blundered by not revealing that the missiles and the nuclear warheads had been placed in Cuba, which undercut the deterrent effect. In response. most of Kennedy’s military leaders and advisors advocated a military strike followed by an invasion. General LeMay pushed, “The Russian bear has always been eager to stick his paw in Latin American waters, let’s take his leg off up to his testicles. On second thought, let’s take off his testicles too.” Confiding to aide Kenny O’Donnell, JFK wryly observed, “These brass hats have one great advantage, if we listened to them, and what they want to do, none of us will be alive to tell them that they were wrong.” Kennedy opted for a blockade, which was called a quarantine, to deemphasize that it was an act of war. On October 22nd the president informed the American public, “we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the course of worldwide nuclear war in which the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouths, but neither will we shrink from that risk any time it must be faced.” As noted, the military were furious with this course of action. Years later McNamara discovered that the reconnaissance flights missed some of the S-4 missiles, and that SS-5 intermediate missiles had also been shipped. And critically, we did not know that the Soviets had already positioned about 100 battlefield nuclear weapons in Cuba. Nor were we aware that we would be facing 43,000 Soviet military personnel and 270,000 armed Cubans. In 1992 McNamara declared that 100,000 Americans would have died in an invasion and that the U.S. would have wiped out Cuba with a “high risk” of nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.4 The crisis proved to be a political epiphany for both Kennedy and Khrushchev.

Khrushchev wrote Kennedy a long letter on October 30, 1962, outlining a series of far-reaching proposals to eliminate, “everything in our relations capable of generating a new crisis.” He proposed: disbanding all nuclear blocs, formal acceptance of two Germanys based on existing borders, he urged the U.S. to recognize China and let it join the UN, and quickly concluding a treaty to stop all nuclear testing everywhere. Kennedy largely agreed, and started promoting a test ban treaty. Saturday Review editor and anti-nuclear activist Norman Cousins worked as an intermediary between Kennedy and Khrushchev. In April he met with Khrushchev, who described the pressure he faced from Kremlin hardliners. When Cousins briefed Kennedy on Khrushchev’s situation Kennedy lamented, “He would like to prevent a nuclear war but is under severe pressure from his hardliner crowd, which interprets every move in that direction as appeasement. I’ve got similar problems.” Kennedy inherited a powerful, semi-independent CIA, which ignored Executive branch policies in country after country. Eisenhower lamented the power of the military-industrial complex, and saw the CIA as “a legacy of ashes.” CIA policies in the Far East challenged him as much as the Bay of Pigs. At home Kennedy confronted a coalition of cold warriors, bankers, and corporate leaders as he attempted to revise U.S. policy towards Indonesia. When he took office U.S.-Indonesian relations were severely strained after a CIA attempt to overthrow non-aligned nationalist leader President Achmed Sukarno. In 1960 the Netherlands still controlled West New Guinea, and President Sukarno began a campaign to gain control of the colony. Domestically, Sukarno was balancing the military against a strong indigenous communist movement. There was also Soviet and Chinese interest in the Indonesian-Dutch conflict. Within the CIA and the State Department there was strong support for the Netherlands, yet Kennedy supported Sukarno, and helped pressure the Dutch to transfer New Guinea to Indonesia.5 In the Middle East Kennedy moved to reopen support for Egypt’s Pan Arabist and socialist Prime Minister Nasser as the best route to moving Arab nationalism toward development and democracy. This opposition to the policies of John Foster Dulles extended to supporting Egypt against Saudi Arabia in the civil war in Yemen. Kennedy did not support the Dulles/Eisenhower intervention in Lebanon in 1958, and he opposed Israel acquiring nuclear weapons – which he thought would further destabilize the region.

Further, he opposed the monarchies in Saudi Arabia and Iran, and advocated commissioning a study to explore the costs of returning Mossedeq to power in Iran.6 In Vietnam, Kennedy inherited an ill-conceived policy, which was wracked with bureaucratic infighting. He often was deprived of information and unable to control factions of the CIA and DOD. Some debate continues as to whether he was pulling out of Vietnam, although recent scholarship, as well as documents that were released through the ARRB, significantly strengthens the case that he was withdrawing. Early policy concerns can be seen in a 1952 NSC memo, which stated “Communist control of all of Southeast Asia would render the U.S. position in the Pacific offshore island chain precarious and would seriously jeopardize fundamental U.S. security interests in the Far East.” America supplied the French with almost 80% of their arms in the failed effort to recapture Vietnam. After the French surrendered to Ho Chi Minh in 1954, the Geneva Accords were signed, temporarily separating Vietnam until elections could be held in 1956. At this point Secretary of State Dulles, Admiral Radford and General Twining initiated a plan to invade Vietnam, but Eisenhower blocked it. In 1954, NSC 5429/2 set in motion a CIA policy, led by Allen Dulles and directed by General Lansdale, which installed a puppet dictatorship under Diem, opposing Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Cong. Lansdale had previously crushed rebellious forces in the Philippines through counter-insurgency, and was able to dethrone Boa Dai and place the U.S.-educated Diem in office. In 1956 Eisenhower chose to cancel the planned U.N.-sponsored elections, realizing that Ho Chi Minh would get around 80% of the vote. A separate government was then created and supported by the U.S. in South Vietnam. Eisenhower then steadily widened the war and furthered the U.S. commitment to counter-insurgency. By June of 1961 Kennedy confronted proposals from his top civilian and military aides to send 60,000 troops to neighboring Laos. Some historians argue that a SEATO invasion plan called for more than twice that many. He rejected these proposals based on the intelligence failure with the Bay of Pigs. JFK told Arthur Schlesinger, “If it hadn’t been for Cuba, we might be about to intervene in Laos.” Waving cables from General Lemnitzer he noted, “we might have taken this advice seriously.” Five months later, he was confronted by his personal military advisor General Maxwell Taylor, and his deputy National Security Advisor, Walt Rostow with the “Taylor Report”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:381:b65a36f0de28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 675, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 382, "text": "plan called for more than twice that many.

According to John Galbraith, the U.S. Ambassador to India, the lobbying was intense. Secretary of Defense McNamara was pushing for 200,000 troops immediately. Galbraith, who had surreptitiously picked up a copy of the “Taylor Report” from Rostow’s office, counseled caution. Unnamed “senior White House officials” leaked word that, as one New York Times headline noted, “Kennedy Remains Opposed to Sending Forces after Hearing Report.” McNamara, Rusk, and Maxwell Taylor pushed to convene an NSC meeting but Kennedy delayed for a week. During that time no visible support arose in Congress, the press or the public.7 …After listening to the arguments for intervention, an impassioned Bobby Kennedy kept insisting ‘We are not sending combat troops. Not committing ourselves to combat troops’ They also show that when Rusk proposed making “saving Vietnam” a formal national policy goal, the President – who’d been largely silent until then-briskly refused. Telling the group coolly that “troops are the last resort”; he said that if they were ever to be sent, he would let them go only as part of a multilateral force, under the sanctions of the UN Security Council.8 Then in NSAM (National Security Action Memorandum) 111 President Kennedy withstood wide-ranging and coordinated military and CIA pressure and decided against committing armed infantry divisions. Kennedy shared General MacArthur’s fears regarding a large land war in Asia, yet he did not want to run for reelection as the president who “lost Vietnam.” A middle path was chosen:", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:382:2c6f779240bf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 676, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "James’ and William’s long needed story, for me, completes the quartet of the four major works anyone needs to read or see about the murder of President Kennedy.

Special thanks to Wim Dankbaar for providing me with film of Thomas E. Robinson. And A big thank-you to John Barbour for his wonderful foreword. n November 2013, I attended the 50^(th) anniversary conference on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. I attended this conference more as a favor to a friend than out of any curiosity or interest. My role as an assistant in the Bethesda autopsy has always been more of a burden than any highlight in my life. It has caused an intrusion into my private life by individuals who have sought to use what I saw and heard during the autopsy to support their personal hypophysis.

For this reason, I have only participated in a limited number of interviews with a few researchers. I later even regretted this limited exposure, because I felt that my words were often used to support conclusions other than those I intended. This is not to say that the things that were attributed to me by the researchers were totally false, but some parts of the interviews were often left out or taken out of context, to support the researcher’s personal theory or conclusion. At the 50^(th) Dallas Conference, I was asked to take questions concerning what I saw and did in the morgue that night. I expected to answer a few questions from a few researchers and authors but was surprised when we went for more than an hour and were asked to return later. That later session lasted until 1:30 in the morning. I was also surprised at the interest of people from other countries. Many people from Japan, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries stopped me to ask questions about what I saw and did that night. These people seemed to have a great interest in the assassination and the answers I had to their questions. I came away from the conference feeling somewhat selfish, because I had refused to participate in the truly passionate interest of so many people for many years. I also became acutely aware of the corrupted and sometime outright misinformation that had been attributed to me and Paul O’Connor, the other corpsman assisting the Doctors in the morgue that night. At this time, I was pretty much unaware of the information that was being attributed to Paul and me. I had received many books written by the few interviewers that I had talked with and had tried to read the parts that pertained to my interviews but became disillusioned with the way my words were used to support conclusions that were never intended by me. Therefore, I decided to limit my discussion with other researchers. This did not stop the phone calls and request for information. I agreed to participate with a few other authors at the urging of Paul. I was disappointed by most of the writings of these researchers with the exception of one, who wrote my words as they were told to him. Over the years he has tried to encourage me to participate more but I have resisted, not wanting to get into the “he said, she said” controversy that has become commonplace among researchers and bloggers.

W ho would have thought that a small town southern boy would find himself standing at an autopsy table assisting with the postmortem on an assassinated president of the United States of America. Certainly not I. But, please allow me to digress for a moment and tell you a little about that southern boy. I was born in a little town in North Mississippi called Eupora. My dad was drafted into the Navy during World War II and my mother and I went to live with her parents until my dad returned from the service. When he returned from the Navy in 1944, we moved to South Mississippi, and my dad bought a couple of sawmills and went into the timber business with my mother’s father. We lived in the country, a little village called Auburn. When the timber played out in this southeast area, my dad moved his sawmills to Louisiana close to Lake Charles and purchased timber tracts there. My dad would transport the sawn timber back to Summit Ms., where we were living at the time. My mother had become ill, and my father moved us to Summit, which was a town of 200 or 300 people, to be close to a doctor. Summit is where my interest in the medical profession started. When I was about 9 or 10 years old, I lived down the street from the town physician. The town I was raised in had a population of about 200 people and only one doctor. The doctor’s hobby was developing different varieties of camellias. He was always working with his camellias when I rode my bicycle past his house and I would stop and watch him grafting and pruning his camellia bushes. He would talk to me and tell me what he was doing, and I would ask annoying questions, but he never seem to mind. He was a little man, balding, and wore glasses – just what you think a doctor would look like in a little boy’s eyes. He wasn’t a jovial kind of person, but he always had a quick and ready smile and always had something encouraging to say to me. Everyone went to him for treatment because he was the only doctor in town. Somehow, and I don’t remember how all these years later, I got interested in what he did. I was curious as a kid and I started asking the doctor questions like “what do you do as a doctor”? He took the time to talk to me about it, and I was intrigued. That’s when I decided that’s what I want to do when I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:2:63d5eac75bdd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 679, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "to me.

That’s when I decided that’s what I want to do when I grow up. I never told my parents of these visits because I was afraid they would have stopped me from bothering the doctor. He seemed to enjoy the visits talking with me and I think that he was a little surprised at my interest at that age. Though my parents never knew where my interest in medicine came from, they liked the idea of me pursuing a medical career. In those days, kids would usually go to the six or seventh grade, drop out of school and pick up some type of manual labor or mechanical work. Very few of the kids that I knew pursued a professional career. A couple of the kids became lawyers or accountants, but most of the ones from my hometown went into the timber business, worked for the railroad, or went into the family business straight out of high school. There wasn’t much opportunity for college. Being in the medical field was something I really wanted, and that was the goal I set for myself. I lived in Summit until I went into the Navy. I attended school there, until the ninth grade. The school system consolidated, and I was moved to McComb High School where I completed my high school education and received my diploma. My dad was the kind of person who believed in work. If I didn’t work I didn’t get an allowance. But if I worked, I got an allowance and a salary. It was a great incentive to work. I started out at about 12 or 13 years of age, working at a drive-in malt shop waiting on cars and serving milk shakes, hot dogs and burgers. I would work after school till about 10 o’clock at night a couple of nights a week and weekends. I made about $35 an hour but it was fun because I got to associate with the “big” kids from school and ride in their cars. I worked doing that through a couple of summers. So, I was well acquainted with working by the time I went to work with my father at the tractor company. One of the men there was an older man in his late 60s. I was pretty much his “go-fer.” I did the heavy lifting. My dad had purposely assigned me to him. Dad paid me about $35.00 a week, no allowance.

So, for a 15-year-old kid in high school, I had money for gas for my car, which I usually charged to my dad’s account at the gas station when I thought I could get away with it, and hanging-out at the drive-in and money to take a date to the midnight movie on Saturday night. Any excess money I put into my car. It was 1957, like most teenagers I loved cars. My car was a thing of beauty in my eyes but not my father’s. She was a 1952 Chevrolet Coup. I worked on the engine myself. I had a three-quarter cam and a home-built three carburetor intake manifold. The1950s was the era of hot rods. And we built our own cars. This particular car was a six-cylinder with a home-built split exhaust manifold. I painted the car – well, I helped paint the car. One of the guys who worked at the Chrysler dealership next to the tractor company, was an excellent painter. He must’ve seen me working on my car because one day he walked over and asked me “why don’t we paint your car?” “I already painted it” I said.” Yeah, I see that” he said. He was trying hard not to laugh, without much success. He told me that if I would buy the paint and bring the car to his house over the weekend that he and his five kids would repaint it for $50.00 . He sprayed the car sierra gold. It was really a bronze color more than gold, and he put a candy-flake in the paint which was a common thing that kids did in those days to make it sparkle. If you were 15 to 25 in the 1950s, cars were a big deal, and customizing your own car was even bigger. That was life for me back then – always trying to do something different to my car to make it cool. There were kids at school who had cars that might’ve been flashier than mine, but I can truly say that there was not another car in town that was faster (at least in my mind). After high school, I went to Southwest Mississippi Jr. College whichwas located in my home town of Summit. After the first year, I realized I wasn’t going to be able to go on to a University because I didn’t have the financial resources.

After the first year, I realized I wasn’t going to be able to go on to a University because I didn’t have the financial resources. So, I decided to join the Navy, not because I wanted to go into the Navy in particular, but because that was the only way I would be able to continue with my education. My father had been in the Navy and so that seemed the best way to go. The Navy offered me educational opportunities that I couldn’t have gotten in other branches of the military. Besides I always liked being in or around water. I always thought that I would like to learn to fly so, I went in as a Naval Aviation Cadet, but when I went through the physical, it was discovered that I was red-green colorblind. Being colorblind would have restricted my flight options. I was told the only things I would be able to fly were propeller driven or rotary driven aircraft, and that wasn’t exciting enough for a naive southern boy nor was it what I was really interested in. I was told I could pick any other thing that interested me. I wanted to go to medical school, so the opportunity to be a hospital corpsman,was more of an interest for me than any of the other options offered. While I wasn’t training to be a doctor it was the closest I could get to my goal at the time without an MD. After boot camp, I went to hospital corps school, which taught me basic diagnosis, treatment of disease, and medical terminology, allowing me to be semi-independent treating patients under the supervision of a physician. Later, I went through a course in field medicine, which taught emergency treatment of battle wounds and other types of trauma. Hospital Corps School lasted about three months. I was single,18 years old living in the barracks and learning. The barracks were open rooms that had double bunks and lockers. It housed anywhere from 100- 250 men. It was a two-story barracks with living quarters on both sides, and in the middle were the heads (bathrooms for you civilians) and showers. The petty officer in charge of the barracks had a small office and living quarters off to the side. After I finished corps school, I was stationed at Cecil Field, a Navy air base in Florida. For my first duty station, I was fortunate to have a commanding officer that took an interest in his people. Captain Nauman stood about 5 foot-nine and was stocky.

He had a very gregarious personality. He was the type of person, to use an old adage, whose bark was worse than his bite. He had more the personality of a drill sergeant than a” four striper,” navy slang for a Captain. There was a group of us that were pranksters and it was a little bit like being in college with these guys – our antics would often get us into trouble and on one such occasion, we had to go before the Captain and he was giving us a thorough dressing down for what we had done and one of guys spoke up and said, “Captain, hold it down your rattling the blinds! The Captain gave us a stern look and shouted, “Just get the hell outta here!’’ We got! For whatever reason, the Captain liked us, and we certainly benefited from it. The Captain had a great deal of trouble at times with his back and he would occasionally have to have it looked at – there was a chance that he would have to have surgery on his spine. The Captain kept putting the surgery off because it might keep him from making Admiral. When he would go to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center for checkups, one of us was required to go with him. I suppose that he liked me, because when I was first stationed at Cecil Field I worked in sick bay where we had the “sick call.” If base personnel were sick you went to “sick call.” Usually, the corpsman would examine you first to determine what your particular ailment was. If it wasn’t something life-threatening, the corpsman would treat you and tell you to return if there was no improvement. If a person came in for a cold or minor laceration he usually never saw the doctor. We would examine them and according to their complaint, check the throat, look at the ears, check the sinuses, listen to the heart, check the pulse rate, blood pressure or maybe suture a minor laceration. If the corpsman was not able to diagnose the problem or the trauma was severe, the doctor would see the patient. Allergies would be treated with antihistamines, infections were treated with antibiotics. We used a lot of procaine penicillin in those days, which was administered by injection.

The one thing I didn’t care for was when I had the duty on the weekends, we had a dependent’s clinic at the dispensary and we saw a lot of military dependent children, and doctors would put kids on penicillin for respiratory infections. These kids would get a regimen of shots that would last 3 to 5 days. So, the parents would bring the kids in to get their shots on weekends. I was usually the youngest and lowest rated corpsman on the watch section, and the older corpsmen would always push the distasteful chores off on me. I would always be the guy to deal with the kids and give them their shots. One day, I had this little boy, probably three or four years old. We always gave the shot in the hip and had never had any trouble before, but this kid went ballistic! The kid was screaming and crying, and his dad was trying to hold him down. As his pants were pulled down, I took an alcohol swab and wiped his buttock where I was going to give the injection. Suddenly, all of his “crocodile tears” dried up, he turned his head and looked up at me and said in a small plaintive voice, “be careful.” I just put the syringe down and walked away. But those were the good times. We also had an ENT clinic (ear, nose and throat) next door to sick bay. The Captain’s interest in medicine was ENT. I would always clean up after the Captain had finished for the day. One day after I had finished cleaning up I was in the clinic reading some of the medical books. The Captain came in and asked me what I was doing, and I told him I was reading, and he asked me, “Are you interested in ENT medicine?” I told him that I was, but I didn’t really know much about it. The Captain didn’t say anything, he just turned and walked out of the room. The next day, my boss, a second-class hospital corpsman, in charge of the sick bay, told me that I would be working with the Captain in ENT today. Everybody there was kind of leery and afraid of the Captain because he was – how should I put this- very direct and a “little” gruff. But I knew the Captain reveled in rattling the people around him, and it only made me like him all the more.

But I knew the Captain reveled in rattling the people around him, and it only made me like him all the more. I wasn’t afraid of him, I had a lot of respect for him, but a lot of the enlisted men were afraid and avoided him. I think that’s part of the reason he took me under his wing. I know most of the reason I went to Bethesda Naval Medical School to attend the clinical laboratory and blood bank course was because Captain Nauman told me that I had three years left in the Navy and I was going to spend them under him and if I didn’t go on to school he would make it “hell on me” and then he walked away laughing. I took this as a “military suggestion” and filled out my application and he had the personnel officer put me in for school. Now, at first, I didn’t want to go to Bethesda for training. My goal was to get out of the Navy and go to college. I’d been at Cecil Field for about a year at that point and unsure of my direction, but unbeknownst to me, the Captain had made arrangements to get me into the Bethesda clinical laboratory and blood bank school before our discussion. I enjoyed the Navy, I never had any problems in the military, and the Captain gave me a lot of support – though he would never have admitted it. Your life can sometimes take unimaginable turns, and when Captain Nauman made the decision to put me in for laboratory and blood bank school at Bethesda Maryland, how could he or I have known that his act of kindness, whatever his reasons, would change the course of my life and I would find myself part of some of the darkest hours in the history of this nation? History that, whether I like it or not, follows me to this very day. he captain pushed me a lot. If he hadn’t I would have not taken promotion as it came, all I wanted was to wait my time out in the military and get back to my primary purpose for going into the military, which was to get the financial resources to continue my college education.

I was interested in testing for diseases. I wanted to work in the laboratory at the Dispensary, but I didn’t want to leave the ENT clinic and the opportunity working with the Captain. He took a lot of interesting in teaching me. He pushed my education far beyond what I had learned at Corps school especially during the ear, nose and throat part of my training. I learned how to determine an external otitis from an internal otitis infection of the ear and how to treat them among other things. So, in pursuing my medical career I wound up in the military at Cecil Field Florida, which not only accounted for my being at Bethesda Naval Hospital but also led to the meeting of my future wife. Several of my friends and I were asked to escort a group of young ladies to a weekend on-base dance at the NCO club. Unescorted civilians were not allowed on base due to the critical nature of the base’s mission. I wasn’t particularly interested in any girl at the dance, but my friend Larry was very interested in dating one of the girls and she wouldn’t go out with him unless it was a double date. So, I agreed to go out with her best friend. You might say I got drafted. I had never thought of getting married but there was something about this girl that I couldn’t put into words. I really enjoyed her company and our shared interests, and how she made me feel when we went to the beach, to a movie, or just being together. Meeting her, like being at Bethesda Naval Hospital on the night of November 22, 1963, would change my life forever. For the first year of our married life my wife and I didn’t have much money. It took every penny we had just to live. People laugh at me when I tell them that the first year of our married life together we ate a lot of chicken pot pies, because they only cost $15 apiece. There was another married couple in our building and we would get together on Friday night and play cards. We didn’t have much money, but we managed with sodas and chips; gone were the days gathering with my friends and having drinks and dinner at the NCO club.

You could buy a Coke for $10 and a bag of potato chips was maybe $15 , especially if we bought them at the base exchange. I was lucky because I was able to be home every night except the nights I had duty in the morgue. My wife did not like being alone on the nights I had duty, but she had no choice. Her uncle whose family my wife had lived with during high school, had retired from the military, so my wife knew what she was in for. It was just something that was expected, and life went along for us as it did for thousands of young married couples in the service. The military gave me a stipend of $125 a month, money that was to aid married families with living expenses, food and things like that, which was a good thing, because I was only making $48–$50 twice a month straight military pay. We found a two room “efficiency” apartment in Gaithersburg, Maryland which cost $123 a month, all utilities paid. My wife soon found a job and we stopped eating Swanson pot pies so often and were able to buy some modest furniture. So, things weren’t so bad for us financially now, as we started our life together. I set about completing 18 months of training at the Bethesda Naval Medical School. My first year at Bethesda was filled with classes in laboratory sci-ences, courses in hematology, microbiology, cytology, blood-banking, pathology and serology, which today is considered immunology. In serology we dealt with antigens and antibodies and their reactions in the serum and their ability to detect diseases with properly prepared serums. We didn’t really know much about the reactions we were dealing with – we just knew that certain tests worked if we prepared the serum correctly. A typical day for me went like this: In the morning we would gather for muster, roll would be called and any information needed for the day was given. Then we would be released to go to various classes. We did this for the first 6 to 8 months. Then came the practical portion. We went into the laboratory departments and did patient testing under supervision of the staff. We still had classes, but not every day, all day, like we had in the first months at Bethesda.

We did this for the first 6 to 8 months. Then came the practical portion. We went into the laboratory departments and did patient testing under supervision of the staff. We still had classes, but not every day, all day, like we had in the first months at Bethesda. These new classes where directed toward developing special tests and skills. Even as students, we had regular military duties, and every fortnight we had to man the duty sections. All of us had various duties, some drew patient blood for testing, others were assigned administrative duties. There were eight of us that had duty in the morgue. I did my first autopsy at Bethesda, though I don’t remember much about the experience. I found doing autopsies interesting because it was a new learning experience. Little did I know that I was about to be involved in the most infamous and controversial autopsy in modern times. On November 22, 1963 I was stationed in Bethesda, Maryland, at the Naval Medical School, where I was a student at The Navy laboratory and blood banking school. As a student I was responsible for the duty every fourth day. My duty consisted of assisting in performing autopsies with resident pathologists. We usually performed two or three autopsies each duty night. On the 22^(nd) at about 3PM, I was in serology class when Bill Lynch, a fellow student, returned from break and told us that the President had been shot during his visit to Dallas. The instructor came in shortly afterwards and told us that the President was dead. He said that classes were dismissed, and the duty crew should report to the morgue, to prepare for an autopsy in case the President’s body came to us at Bethesda. Paul and I began to set up the instruments and label the specimen jars for the tissue samples that we normally took at autopsy. These jars were used to hold tissue samples taken from various organs and areas of the body for the microscopic exams. We were using tape for labels on the jars with the date autopsy number and patient name. After we had finished labeling, we were told to remove all the labels and re-label the specimen jars with only the autopsy number. We were also told not to log the President’s name into the logbook. We were to only use the next sequential number for identification. During this time, we were told that the President’s body would definitely be brought to the Bethesda morgue for autopsy. Dr. Boswell came in and confirmed that we would be doing the autopsy on the President’s body. When I asked the first-class corpsman why we were doing the autopsy instead of Walter Reed Medical Center or AFIP in downtown DC, he said that it was probably because the President was Navy.

I later learned that Mrs. Kennedy had requested that the autopsy be performed at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. The timeline that I use in the discussion of the following events, was established by Dennis David, the Chief of the Day for the Medical School and collaborated by Sergeant Roger Boyajian, the Marine sergeant in charge of the security detail, in his action report and verified years later by Dr. Jay Cox, the Officer of the Day for the Hospital, in a telephone conversation with William Law. My duties required that I remain attentive to the pathologist’s needs and to help meet those needs. It was necessary to be able to hear and see what the pathologist wanted me to do at all times. Paul and I were HM3 hospital corpsmen and were the lowest people on the “totem pole” in the morgue that night. We did what we were told and asked no questions. It was a very intense and sometimes disconcerting situation. The body arrived in the morgue about 1835(6:35PM). It was brought into the morgue in a grayish-brown shipping-transport casket, not the bronze burial casket that the body was reportedly placed in at Parkland Hospital. The casket was placed on the floor beside the autopsy table, the body was removed and placed on the front table where the autopsy was performed. I did not directly participate in the removal of the body from the casket, because there seemed to be too many helpers already, mostly civilians in suits and maybe a military officer or two. Paul was the only enlisted person I remember seeing that helped remove the body from the casket and he like myself was dressed in surgical scrubs. When the body arrived, I was busy at the front table preparing the instruments for the autopsy. The body was placed on the table in front of me. The body was wrapped in a single sheet and the head was wrapped in what appeared to be a towel and a sheet. After the body was removed from the casket and placed on the autopsy table, Dr. Boswell thanked everyone for their help and asked everyone with the exception of Paul and me to leave the morgue. Dr. Boswell then told us not to unwrap the body or to let anyone into the morgue and he left the morgue.

Dr. Boswell then told us not to unwrap the body or to let anyone into the morgue and he left the morgue. I assumed that he was going upstairs to the laboratory to coordinate the autopsy procedure with Dr. James J. Humes. After about 15-20 minutes, Dr. Boswell returned, he and I unwrapped the body and covered it with a sheet from the waist down. Dr. Boswell gave me the clipboard with the face sheet, a printed form for entering distinguishing body markings etc., and we started recording the body measurements and identifying scars, marks and wounds, surgical and otherwise. Dr. Boswell examined the body and gave me the measurements and locations and I wrote them on the face sheet. I then gave Dr. Boswell the face sheet and he verified the placement of the scars, surgical incisions and body wounds. During this time, Dr. Humes and several military officers arrived in the morgue and other individuals began to filter in. The military and civilians went into the gallery. Dr. Humes came to the autopsy table and began examining the head. He then removed the sheet and the blood-soaked towel from the head and discarded them on the floor and I thought to myself, “why didn’t he use the waste bucket under the head of the autopsy table?” I stood at the right shoulder of the body and looked down at the face of President Kennedy. He could’ve been sleeping except his right eye was slightly open and the left eye closed, his lips were slightly parted, there was a huge gash in the front of his throat. The hair was bloody and matted together so I didn’t see the massive damage to his head at first glance. As Dr. Humes removed the wrappings from the head, the wound gaped open along a laceration that ran forward along the top of the head, but immediately closed when it was separated from the bottom wrappings which appeared to be towels. The first appearance of the head wound was deceiving, as the reader will learn later. I didn’t have the time for much thought or feeling, I was on auto-pilot, concentrating on the job at hand. Paul or I later removed the wrappings to the hampers in the dirty linen room. I don’t remember which one of us put them in the dirty linen hampers.

We only had a contamination hamper for bloody and contaminated linen which was to be incinerated and a second hamper to be sent to the laundry. Was he talking about another morgue? The medical photography technician, a Hospital corpsman, began taking a series of photographs under the direction of Dr. Humes, mainly of the head area and the upper thorax. There were other photographs taken during the autopsy by a civilian medical photographer, John Stringer, who had come into the morgue with Dr. John H. Ebersol. As the x-ray technician prepared, everyone was asked to leave the morgue while the x-rays were being taken. I was given a lead apron, so I could help position the body for the x-rays that Dr. Humes ordered. We took AP’s (front), laterals and obliques of the head and upper thorax and neck. After the x-rays were completed, the technician left the morgue to process the film in the x-ray department. When the technician and a helper returned to the morgue with the processed x-ray films, they showed no bullets or large fragments in the body. This seemed to produce tension between the military officials in the gallery and the autopsy doctors, and we were told to repeat the x-rays. The x-ray technician and his assistant repeated the same set of x-rays that we had previously taken. The new set of x-rays also showed no bullets or large fragments. Dr. Ebersol, the radiologist, was then called to the morgue to direct a second re-taking of the x-rays. When these were developed, Dr. Ebersol and the technicians returned to the morgue with the films and a bank of x-ray view boxes, which were set up against the back wall. The doctors and others from the gallery moved to the view boxes to examine the three sets of x-rays. They found no large fragments or partial bullets in the third set. This seemed to intensify the tension between the military officials in the gallery and the autopsy doctors. While I could see the x-rays, now, I have to say that at that time in 1963, my familiarity with x-rays was very limited. I could possibly find a broken bone or cloudy chest, but I would have had to have a doctor verify those finding for me.

There seemed to be a lot of frustration and tension in the conversations because the x-rays showed no partial bullets or large metal fragments. After we were finished with the x-rays, additional pictures were taken of the President’s body by John Stringer, the civilian photographer that had followed Dr. Ebersol into the morgue. Floyd Riebe, who was the assistant to the civilian photographer John Stringer, had taken the first photographs of the president’s head immediately after the head was unwrapped. This was before any washing of the body or any manipulation of the head or scalp had occurred. At some point in the process of taking pictures, I was vaguely aware of some kind of commotion near the back of the gallery. I was later told that Riebe had his camera taken and the film exposed by the Secret Service. After the x-rays were finished, I don’t remember much about Stringer taking photographs. I have seen the so-called “Fox” set of photographs, and I do remember that the body was not clean, nor was the back of the president’s head intact when Stringer was taking pictures. There were additional pictures taken throughout the autopsy, but the body was not cleaned until it was turned over to the morticians after the autopsy had ended. Dr. Pierre A. Fink and Dr. Humes started examining the head wounds. They found a small wound on the right side of the head in the temporal area just forward and slightly above the right ear. The small hole (wound) was rounded and about the size of the tip of one’s little finger. There appeared to be graying around the margins of the wound, but it was difficult to see because the wound was in the hair line. Dr. Fink speculated that the gray material might have come from a bullet. During the examination of the temple wound, Dr. Humes was called to the gallery to talk to one of the people that had come into the morgue with him and who seemed to be directing the autopsy. I later was told this was Dr. George G. Burkley (Admiral), the President’s personal physician. Dr. Humes returned to the table and immediately directed Dr. Fink away from the small wound in the temple to the large posterior head wound. The temple wound was abandoned and never returned to that night. Drs. Humes and Fink turned their attention to the large posterior head wound and began to examine its extent and boundaries.

The temple wound was abandoned and never returned to that night. Drs. Humes and Fink turned their attention to the large posterior head wound and began to examine its extent and boundaries. After the examination of the large posterior, occipital-parietal head wound began, Dr. Humes noticed an area of connected scalp lacerations, along the top of the head that extended forward almost parallel to the midline just past the coronal suture. They extended almost to the frontal bone of the skull. They appeared to have been surgically altered. This prompted Dr. Humes to ask someone in the gallery if there had been any surgery done on the head in Dallas. He was told that there had been no surgery on the head in Dallas. Some of these tears in the scalp appeared to be extended laterally along the top of the head. This could have occurred when the bone underneath was fractured and expanded from the force created by the passage of the bullet, but the lacerations seemed to be neater, cleaner, less random and more directional than the other lacerations in the area as if they had been surgically connected. The posterior head wound will be discussed in more detail later. After the head wound examination was finished Dr. Humes removed the brain by extending some of the lacerations along fracture lines and spreading the fractures in the underlying skull. The traditional skull cap procedure was not necessary for access to the brain cavity. Dr. Humes then handed the brain to Dr. Boswell who motioned for me to follow and we walked to the end of the autopsy table and through the separation between the two autopsy tables to the infusion bucket. I bent down on one knee and was given the brain, which I placed upside down in a gauze sling over the brain bucket. The brain bucket was close to cabinets that were on the wall opposite the gallery. There were two sets of cabinets, wall cabinets with floor cabinets underneath. On top of the cabinets that were mounted on the wall, there was a large glass carboy. A carboy is nothing more than a big glass jar with a spigot at the bottom. It was filled with formalin, which is diluted formaldehyde adjusted to the pH of the body. The carboy had a plastic tube attached to the spigot that came down and was separated into a “Y” to give two tubes. At the end of these tubes were attached needles. Our normal procedure was to take the needles and insert them into the internal carotid arteries.

Our normal procedure was to take the needles and insert them into the internal carotid arteries. The internal carotid arteries are a part of the brain’s vascular system at the base of the brain. Suture silk would be used to tie off the ends of the arteries, and then the spigot would be opened. Gravity would force the formalin to infusion into the brain. After the brain began infusing at the beginning of the autopsy, it would be left until the completion of the autopsy. Then we would remove the infusion apparatus, drop the brain in the bucket filled with formalin solution, put the lid on it, and put it in the brain room. It would sit in the bucket at least 72 hours. Most of the time, brains would sit there until the following Monday. Unless an autopsy was performed on Saturday night, or Sunday then that brain would not have been examined or sectioned on Monday. If an infused brain had been allowed enough time for the brain to be fixed, i.e. the required 72 hours, the brain would be sectioned and examined on Monday. The reason we didn’t fix brains by just dropping them into the bucket of formalin was that it would take at least seven days for brain to be firm enough to section versus 72 hours with the extra infusion process. I was having trouble getting the needles into the carotid arteries because the ends of the vessels had constricted, making it difficult to insert the needles. One of the residents who had come into the morgue to bring something to Dr. Boswell, came over to see if he could help me insert the needles. The fact that the vessels appeared shriveled and had constricted, led me to believe that they had been cut for quite some time and this along with the irregularly cut brain stem and the long laceration of the scalp that gaped open when the head wrappings were removed gave credence to the possibility that the brain had been removed from the head and replaced or substituted back into the head some hours before. In other words, the brain had been removed from the cranium and then replaced or substituted prior to the arrival of the body at the Bethesda morgue.

We did not normally weigh the brain in the morgue before we infused it. This was a normal procedure for the handling of recently removed brains at the Bethesda morgue. The brain would be infused, placed in a stainless bucket of formalin, covered with the lid and placed in what we call “the brain room” for a supplemental autopsy after the brain was fully fixed. The supplemental autopsy was usually done as a teaching mechanism for the residence. Dr. Fink said that he was told upon his arrival in the morgue that Dr. Humes had only to extend a few fracture lines to be able to remove the brain. This is supported by Dr. Fink’s written report to his commanding officer General Joseph M. Blumberg. This report is somewhat suspect because the brain was removed after the head was examined by both Dr. Fink and Dr. Humes. During the examination of the head, the small wound on the right temple just slightly forward and above the right ear was discovered and examined by both Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink while the brain was still in the cranium. Dr. Fink also later testified that he had suggested the taking of some of the x-rays. I don’t remember any x-ray being taken after the removal of the brain. I believe the x-ray personnel had left the morgue by that time. Tom Robinson, the mortician who prepared the President’s body for burial, states that he and his assistants closed the head wound by using a small rubber sheet to replace the 3 inches of missing bone and scalp and that the remaining wound was closed by stretching the remaining scalp over the skull fractures and suturing them closed. He made no mention of replacing the skull cap which he would have had to do if the brain had been removed by doing a normal skull cap. Tom Robinson also stated that he saw what seemed to be marks from a bone saw in the right temporal area. These marks were probably not from a bone saw. We used a Stryker saw at the Bethesda morgue to cut bone and remove the skull cap. This saw has a blade that vibrates back and forth and does not cut flesh. It is designed to cut solid fixed material such as bone. It would have been difficult if not impossible to cut the floating, fractured bone of the skull without first being able to fix each individual piece in a rigid manner. For this reason, it seems improbable that Dr. Humes’ testimony, before the ARRB board, that he did a skull cap, is plausible.

For this reason, it seems improbable that Dr. Humes’ testimony, before the ARRB board, that he did a skull cap, is plausible. During a normal autopsy, the brain would have been removed by doing a skull cap. This procedure began with a coronal incision from one ear to the other ear and reflecting the scalp backward to the occipital area and forward to the frontal area. We would then remove the skull cap by sawing around the skull leaving a notch in the frontal bone to be able to replace the skull cap in the same position after the brain was removed. Once the skull cap was replaced, the reflected scalp would be brought together and sutured in place. This was not the closure procedure described by Tom Robinson, the mortician who closed the head wounds. The descriptions of the brain in the supplemental autopsy report is more consistent with the description given by the Parkland doctors than its consistency with the brain that was removed from the cranium by Dr. Humes during the Bethesda autopsy. This points to the credibility of Doug Horns belief that there were two brains. If this is the case, the first brain described in the supplemental autopsy of the official autopsy report appears to be the original brain that was possibly removed prior to the Bethesda autopsy. A clue to the possible truth of the statement is the testimony of Dr. Humes when he said that he took the brain and locked it in Dr. John H. Stover’s closet. I guess the remaining question is whether the brain that Dr. Humes locked in the closet was given to him prior to the autopsy or was it the actual brain that was taking during the autopsy? It now seems possible, after reading the original autopsy report statement of Dr. Humes, that he placed the bucket with the brain in Dr. Stover’s locked closet. This raises the possibility that the original brain may have been brought to Bethesda separate from the body and was placed in the locked closet prior to the beginning of the autopsy. If this is the case, then the brain that was removed from the cranium by Dr. Humes and infused by me and Dr. Boswell was a substitute brain. This would’ve accounted for its appearance and the inconsistency with the amount of damage to the brain seen at autopsy when compared to the damage of the skull and scalp.

Since my request for permission to view the original photographs in the National Archives has been denied by Paul Kirk Jr., the Kennedy lawyer who controls the access to these photos and x-rays and I have received no response to an email address that was given to me by my local congressman’s aide, I can only rely on the descriptions of the photographs viewed by Dr. Michael Chesser and Dr. David Mantik. In 2015, I had the opportunity to sit down with William Law, author and researcher, Dr. David Mantik, a noted Pathology-Oncologist with a Doctorate in Physics and Dr. Michael Chesser, a neurologist, both of whom had viewed the photographs of the President’s brain in the national archives. Before this meeting, I had made notes on the unusual appearance of the brain as it was removed from the cranium by Dr. Humes during the autopsy. At the meeting, I asked Dr. Chesser to describe the brain that he saw on his visit to the national archives. Dr. Chesser told me that the brain in the archives photograph appeared to have been in formalin for some time. I then asked him to describe what he saw that led him to that conclusion. He described the brain in the archive photographs as being asymmetrical, as if it had been lying in a container of preservative with other brains and it appeared to be flattened on the top of the left cerebral lobe. I then asked him to describe the damage to the brain in the photographs that he saw in the national archives. Dr. Chesser said that the damage was primarily to the rear of the right parietal lobe and that there appeared to be very little discernible damage to the cerebellum. Dr. Chesser also described what appeared to be saw marks along the left frontal area of the left cerebral lobe as if a routine skull cap procedure had been done to remove the brain. This is significant, because there was no saw used to remove the president’s brain at the Bethesda autopsy. Dr. Humes only had to extend several fracture lines with a scalpel and the defect could be spread open enough to allow the brain to be removed.

It seemed to be smaller than expected in comparison to the size of the president’s head and the damage was primarily to the posterior of the right cerebral lobe. The damage to the brain didn’t seem to correlate with the damage seen on the skull and scalp. The damage to the skull and scalp seemed to be much more extensive than one would expect if only determined from the damage seen to the brain. The gyri appeared to be larger and flatter and the sulci seemed to be much narrower compared to the usual brains taken at autopsy. The surface seemed to be smoother and shinier than usual. It seemed to have a pale, whitish color, not the usual gray that we saw at autopsy. I believe this occurred in the area where Dr. Chesser saw the flattening on the top of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. There were other anomalies; as we were trying to infuse the brain, there appeared to be no major damage to the underside of the brain. The brain stem appeared to have been severed from two different sides. The cerebellum seemed to be intact with no noticeable damage and the internal carotid arteries were severely retracted and shriveled as if they had been cut for some time, not as expected with a recently removed brain. This retraction of the arteries made it difficult to insert the infusion needles and required the help of a resident, who I later learned was the chief pathology resident. After my discussion with Dr. Chesser and Dr. Mantik, I now believe that I have answers to the abnormal appearance of the brain that I helped infuse at the Bethesda autopsy. I now believe there is a great probability that the brain we infused in the morgue is the same brain seen by Dr. Chesser in the national archives photograph and is probably not the President’s brain. A later discussion with Dr. Chesser concerning the extent of the damage to the brain he saw in the archives in comparison to the damage I observed while infusing the brain taken at autopsy, seemed to indicate a more extensive damage to the brain in the archive photo due to a large laceration that transverses the brain from back to front. This could possibly mean that the President’s brain was removed, examined and replaced or substituted before the body was received in the Bethesda morgue for autopsy.

I believe there is further support for this conclusion in the description of the brain damage given in the official autopsy report and the Ida Dox drawing. Neither the autopsy report description or the Ida Dox drawing match the description of the brain that was removed at autopsy. The damage to the brain stated by the Parkland doctors, that approximately one-third to one-half of the brain was missing and the cerebellum was severely damaged and hanging on by a thread would be consistent with the supplemental autopsy report but would not be consistent with the appearance of the brain that was removed at autopsy. This type of damage to the brain would have been more consistent with the damage listed in the supplemental autopsy report and that seen in the Ida Dox drawing opposed to what one would expect from observing the damage to the skull and scalp. The damage to the brain taken at the Bethesda autopsy did not show noticeable damage to the cerebellum or damage comparable to what you would expect when observing the damage to the skull and scalp or to that described by the Parkland doctors. As Dr. Humes was removing the brain from the skull, I heard him say as if to himself, “the damn thing almost fell out into my hands.” This led me to believe at the time, that the damage caused by the bullet had somehow severed the brainstem and the brain was unattached in the cranium, but the brain removed at the Bethesda autopsy showed that the brain stem had been surgically cut, as described previously, with minimum damage to the cerebellum or underside of the brain Doug Horne, the military analyst for the ARRB found evidence of two brain examinations by the autopsy pathologist, one where Drs. Humes and Boswell attended with a medical photographer, John Stringer. Stringer stated that he took photographs of coronal sections of the brain over a viewing plate. Dr. Humes later stated in the supplemental autopsy report that the brain was not sectioned in order to preserve it integrity. Mr. Stringer also stated that he took no photographs of the underside of the brain, yet one of the national archive photographs seen by Dr. Chesser is clearly of the underside of the brain.

This is an accurate description of the brain’s gyrus and sulci that I helped infused at the Bethesda autopsy. This is also a description of the brain photograph viewed by Dr. Chesser in the National Archives. After the infusion of the brain was started, Dr. Boswell and I returned to the autopsy table, and started the autopsy of the body proper. Dr. Boswell started the autopsy of the body by making the normal ‘U” shaped incision from the right armpit across the chest at about the level of the diaphragm to the left armpit. We then folded the flap created by this incision back over the neck and face to expose the rib cage. We then used a Stryker saw to remove the rib chest plate. The chest organs were examined and removed. The chest cavity was then examined for signs of wounds, tears or other indications that a missile had entered the cavity. We found no indication that anything had entered the cavity. There was no large amount of blood or fluid as you would expect to find if an organ had been torn or if the pleural cavity had been breached. The “U” incision was extended from the center of the “U” shaped chest incision to the pubic area. After tying off the major vessels to reduce the amount of blood draining from the arterial-venous system, the organs were removed, and I placed the dissection board over the body, the organs were placed on the dissection board for examination and dissection. The lungs appeared to be exceptionally pink and healthy with what seemed to be very little fluid accumulation in the lungs, which you often see in massive trauma. This prompted a question to the gallery, did the President smoke? Someone in the gallery, probably Admiral Burkley, said, “he only smoked an occasional cigar.” We did not often see healthy lungs at autopsy in those days – almost everyone smoked. After the lungs were removed from the pleural cavity and examined, we found a reddish, almost bluish small area on the right upper lobe just above the apex of the middle lobe at the junction of the upper lobe, the middle lobe, and the lower lobe. It was about the size of the end of the thumb. This reddish area correlated with the approximate level of the probed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:23:679a4b5d10f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 700, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "see healthy lungs at autopsy in those days – almost everyone smoked.

It was about the size of the end of the thumb. This reddish area correlated with the approximate level of the probed depth of the back wound. The red dot represents the relative position on the upper lobe of the right lung. While the red spot was described as being located on the upper lobe of the lung at the top of the middle lobe, one must take into consideration that the lower lobe of the lung partially covers the middle lobe and part of the upper lobe in the posterior view. This makes it impossible to precisely locate the reddish-purple spot seen at autopsy on a one-dimensional drawing. Dr. Boswell took samples from the “red spot” for microscopic examination. Next, we examined the heart. Dr. Boswell opened the heart and examined the heart valves; they all appeared to be normal and healthy. The stomach was opened, and the contents were examined. The lining was examined for lesions, ulcers or other pathology. Dr. Boswell removed the intestinal tract from the stomach and we took it intact to the deep sink, there we took sections and cut the intestines open, cleaned them and examined the lining. This was a normal protocol. Normally, one of the technicians would have done this type of work. We would have taken the intestines and colon, opened them, cleaned them and then the pathologist would have examined them. Instead, Dr. Boswell did all the work. I was there to assist him if he needed help. Once the examination of the intestines was completed, they were left in the deep sink. Dr. Boswell and I went back to the autopsy table and examined the liver. It seemed to be healthy. We took the kidneys, the spleen, and the pancreas and examined them. They all appeared to be normal, there was no cancerous tissue, no ischemia, or other pathology found. Nothing abnormal was found in the other organs with the exception of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands normally sit on the top of the kidneys and are about the size of a walnut. The President’s adrenal glands were almost nonexistent, they appeared to be severely atrophied and wasted. Dr. Burkley didn’t want us to examine the kidneys because the Kennedy family apparently didn’t want the general public to know about the President’s illness. We had to take the kidneys anyway. There was someone from the Kennedy family, through Dr. Burkley, insisting that the autopsy only consist of the head area but the doctors kept pushing for a full autopsy.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:24:92b1519105b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 701, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "size of a walnut.

There was someone from the Kennedy family, through Dr. Burkley, insisting that the autopsy only consist of the head area but the doctors kept pushing for a full autopsy. We had found no bullets or fragments of bullets and I think Dr. Fink and Dr. Humes worried that a bullet or fragment had ended up in the abdominal area or somewhere else in the body, and that’s why they argued for a total autopsy instead of just stopping at the chest. We took tissue sections of the adrenals, but you couldn’t really tell if you were in the adrenals or not. We took sections for study from all organs, anything that appeared to be unusual or suspect. Normally, we take a section from a normal area and one from an abnormal area if an abnormal area is found. That way you can compare the tissue within the same organ once you process tissue samples for slides. The organs on the cutting board were weighed and entered on the face sheet. At this time, the internal organs had all been removed and the body cavity was empty. I could see that Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink had started to probe the back wound. Dr. Humes first probed the wound with a metal probe but later used a round tipped sound (probe) and his little finger because he was afraid of creating a false passage from the back wound into the chest cavity. The impression that his finger made was clearly visible under the pleural lining of the chest cavity. There was no entrance found into the chest cavity from the back wound. The wound seemed to end slightly above the apex of the middle lobe of the right lung. This seemed to correlate with the reddish-purple area found on the bottom of the upper lobe of the right lung. The wound appeared to extend downward from the entrance about 45 to 60 degrees. This back wound will be discussed later. There was no entry into the pleural cavity, or tear in the pleural lining. The meaning of this will become important later. At this point in the autopsy, more pictures of the head and other specific areas of the body were taken, i.e., with the brain out of the head, a picture of the empty cranium was taken. The photographer took his pictures without any interruption to our work at the autopsy table.

As the doctors directed what they wanted to have photographed, they sometimes would hold the head or the body in certain positions. The empty body cavity was examined, and no wounds were found to have penetrated into the chest or body cavities. After Dr. Boswell and I had finished the autopsy of the body, I saw that Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink had retracted the scalp back away from the head wound, so that the full extent of the head wound could be seen clearly. I could tell the major portion of the area which looked like the wound going forward was not actually part of the original wound of missing bone and scalp. It just intersected with it. It looked as if it was a fracture line going forward slightly past the coronal suture almost to the frontal bone. The coronal suture runs across the skull in front of one ear to the other ear and separates the frontal bone from the parietal bones. You could see that the area where the bone was actually missing was in the parietal-occipital area in the back of the head and extended downward touching the temporal area. The wound was not a totally circular wound. It had a ragged convex top with a rectangular/trapezoid shape tapering off to the right, when viewed from the back of the head, at the bottom was a kind of a tail. There were areas where you could tell that the bone had been chipped out on the surface. When Humes asked about “surgery to the head at Parkland” he was referring to the area on the top of the head where the scalp was holding the fractured skull together, the fractured skull was still adhered to the scalp and there was a laceration in this area that was connected to the top of the wound and ran forward almost to the frontal bone. The laceration seemed to consist of multiple tears in the scalp connected by small neat, clean incisions. The fractured bone pieces that were still attached to the scalp, had separated from the scalp when the scalp was reflected. This made the original wound of missing bone and scalp appear to be larger than when I first saw it. This may account for the differences between the size of the wound seen at Parkland and the size of the wound listed in the official autopsy report.

This may account for the differences between the size of the wound seen at Parkland and the size of the wound listed in the official autopsy report. One could take the skull and open it up on the right side. It was as if you could take the skull and fold it down. It was very ragged. Some of the fractures of the skull had actually caused tears in the scalp itself but had not separated from the scalp. This long laceration along the fracture lines seemed to be responsible for the gaping seen when the head was unwrapped. The comments I remember from Humes and Boswell were “the skull is really malleable.” You could move the bones on the right side of the head around with your hand. Humes continued his inspection of the head with Dr. Fink. Late into the autopsy, a man in a suit came into the autopsy room. He had a small plastic bag with a twist tie at the top. The bag contained pieces of bone and bullet fragments. I remember Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink took the pieces of bone out of the bag and tried to fit them into the area of the head wound, but they were not able to make the bone fragments fit very well. There were still two thirds of the open wound visible. The doctors took a flap of scalp that was at the back of the head and stretched it back up to see if it could be used to cover the still open wound in the skull. It could not, as there was still a portion of the wound that was visible with missing bone and scalp. There weren’t enough bone pieces to complete the defect in the skull. The last time I saw the bone and metal fragments they were laying on the autopsy table next to the president’s head beneath his right ear. Once we finished the autopsy, the small plastic bag had disappeared. The three larger bone fragments that Dr. Humes discusses in the autopsy report, I never saw. The autopsy was finished around midnight and the President’s body was turned over to the morticians. I say morticians, because I understand that there were supposed to be three that did work on the president’s, but I only remember one, and two helpers. I noticed him rather late in the autopsy standing by the back, autopsy table, leaning on the rail in front of the gallery. I noticed him because of the way he was dressed.

He was dressed in a three-piece suit and wearing a bowler hat, his vest was actually more of a waistcoat than a normal vest, but it was matched to the suit. It was a very elegant tailored suit but the bowler hat he was wearing was what drew my attention and he was carrying an umbrella or cane, I’m not sure which. I assumed he was from Boston or somewhere in Massachusetts, because of the Kennedy’s connection with this area, so I assumed they had sent their own mortician. I saw two people bring in embalming equipment; they arrived after I noticed the first mortician. They were not dressed in suits. They were dressed in casual clothes. These two men set up the pump for the embalming process. The mortician that was dressed in a three-piece suit did the main work on the president’s body. He warmed the body with warm water which I gave him from the deep sink because there was only cold water available at the autopsy table. He then took what I assumed was plaster of paris and filled the body cavity. The only parts of the internal organs that were returned to the body were the intestine that was cut up into the body cavity to help activate the plaster filler. I understand that this is normal procedure. I stood within earshot so I could help the mortician with anything he might need. All I remember him asking me for was the basin of warm water. There was a spray device that we used at the morgue table but it was only attached to cold water. We used it for cleaning up after autopsies. The mortician then filled the body cavity and closed the” U” incision and formed the abdomen, making the president look like he had a six pack. Next, he cleaned and closed the head wound and used a brown rubber material to cover the area he could not cover by stretching the loose scalp over the wound. This was done after the skull cavity was filled with the plaster material. He then put mortician’s wax on the small wound in the right temple over the ear, which I believe was from a bullet, and then sutured the wound in the throat and put wax over it, so the wound appeared to be nonexistent.

I know that there are photos that exist (Fox photos) showing what is purportedly the back of the president’s head. The back of the head appears to be intact and the hair looks clean and shiny, freshly washed, but no pictures were taken after the autopsy ended or during the time the mortician was working on the body. After the President’s body was moved from the first table where the autopsy had been performed, to the second table, the mortician began working on the cosmetics for the President’s face. After the mortician finished the cosmetics, the President looked perfectly normal. I understand that Jacqueline Kennedy when she saw the president’s body at the White House later, said something like “that’s not Jack” but I thought he looked fine. The only problem the mortician had making up the President’s face was that he couldn’t get the right eye to completely close. He solved the problem by putting a small suture stitch under the eyelid to keep it closed and make it look normal. Paul O’Connor and I then helped the mortician dress the body. We put socks on the President along with garters, undershorts, undershirt, trousers, shirt, and shoes. Normally, as I understand it, when the body is being dressed at a funeral home, the clothes are split up the back to make it easier to dress the body. This was not done with the President’s body. I helped hold the body up to allow the mortician and Paul to dress the body without cutting the clothing. Once the body was dressed, it was placed in a new casket that had been brought into the morgue around midnight by Gawler’s Funeral Home. Paul later told me he was handed rosary beads by someone and was told to wrap them in President Kennedy’s hands, and he did. I don’t remember that, to be honest, I don’t remember the rosary beads.

It took Paul and me several hours to clean the morgue. After we came out of the morgue, we were met by someone who told us to report to Captain Stover’s office. Paul and I went to Stover’s office where we were issued two sets of orders both verbally and written, one set from the Navy and one from the Department of Defense. We stood in front of Captain Stover’s desk. Stover then said, “Gentlemen, you are not to discuss what you have seen or heard or participated in the morgue last night. Do you understand the order?” Paul and I of course said, “Yes, sir.” What else were two third-class corpsmen who had just witnessed the autopsy of the 35^(th) president of the United States going to say, but “Yes, sir?” We were then asked to sign the orders, which Paul and I did. We were then given copies of the orders and Captain Stover dismissed us. We left the office and started to walk away when a man in a suit that had been in Captain Stover’s office when we were given the orders to sign, came out of the office and said that he needed to take the copies and told us that we were not supposed to have been given the copies. We gave our copies of the orders to the man and he said ‘thank you” and went back into Capt. Stover’s office. Paul and I looked at each other, too tired at this point to be shocked or surprised. I didn’t know where Paul went, but I went out to the parking lot where I met my wife and drove home, eager for sleep. Why did I think the man from Stover’s office came and ask for the copies of the orders we had been given, back?

I knew nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald during the autopsy as I had been sequestered in the morgue since 3:30 that afternoon. It did seem a little unusual that Paul and I had received orders from the Department of Defense, and to this day I don’t know why, because orders from the Department of the Navy would have been sufficient. I never discussed the Kennedy autopsy or my part in it. I never talked about it with my wife, or Paul or any of our friends, besides, who would believe me. Instead, I went back to my life as usual. I was stationed at Bethesda hospital for another year. Life during that time continued to be filled with classwork and duty in the morgue. After graduation, my next duty station was a naval hospital labora-tory in Philadelphia, Pa. I worked in the hematology department and in pathology processing tissue samples and assisting in the morgue with autopsies, the things I had been trained for at Bethesda. We had students at Philadelphia that would normally do autopsies, but when they were in class and not available, I would assist with the autopsies. At Philadelphia Naval Hospital, it was different. The pathology residents actually did the autopsies but we did very few autopsies, certainly not to the extent we did at Bethesda. But, basically the autopsy procedures were the same. Pennsylvania law was different; for instance, in Philadelphia the organs would have to be returned to the body as opposed to the regulations in Maryland. While we were stationed in Philadelphia, my wife and I lived in an apartment in New Jersey which was across the Walt Whitman Bridge from Philadelphia. My wife had a job working as a receptionist, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Every day she would take me to work, and some days she was able to pick me up after my day was finished. When she wasn’t able to pick me up after work, I would take the bus to downtown Philadelphia, and take the subway across the river to Camden and take the bus home. I didn’t like taking the subway because it was extremely dangerous being in that area in those days. My wife had developed a friendship with one of the older ladies that lived in the same apartment complex, who also worked in Cherry Hill.

My wife had developed a friendship with one of the older ladies that lived in the same apartment complex, who also worked in Cherry Hill. She didn’t have a car, so she rode public transportation to work. My wife began to ride the same transportation with her, to work. This gave me the opportunity to drive the car back and forth to work. I worked rotating shifts, a month on nights, a month on days. I was part of the staff at the hospital. There was always some danger for my wife riding the bus and I always worried about that. A woman who lived across from us in the apartment complex had been attacked in her apartment. One night before I had to leave for work, my wife and I were sitting on the couch watching TV and someone tried to break in our front door. Neither my wife nor I liked the cold weather of Philadelphia or the unsafe conditions that we were forced to live in, and we were both miserable. I decided to ask for a transfer to Florida nearer to my wife’s family. There was a billet open in Key West for a second-class hospital corpsman with a certification in laboratory sciences. I made the request for the billet and was assigned to the USS Bushnell, which was a submarine tender. It was a large ship. There were 900 sailors stationed on board. The Bushnell was actually a maintenance docking for submarines, but it qualified for sea duty. My wife and I moved into a small house which we were able to furnish comfortably. I had some seniority by then. I had received a promotion, so in the squadron, I had more authority on the ship along with a lot of responsibility. Florida was great! We bought a small boat, and went fishing almost every day after work, my wife caught fish but I just drowned bait. My duties included managing the ships pharmacy and laboratory, being responsible for the the needs of the corpsman’s medical stations on the nine submarines and the needs of the corpsmen at the dive locker which were assigned to the Subron12 squadron. I had two Submarines that had corpsmen on them that out ranked me, so, I didn’t have to do as much for them; they usually took care of their own medical lockers, inventories and turned the reports into me on the Bushnell.

I was even the designated career counselor on the ship, which was a joke because everyone knew that I planned to get out and return to college. Everyone ragged me about this assignment so, if you laughed you got appointed the assistant career counselor for your department. This quieted the harassment some. Aboard the USS Bushnell, we had about 12 corpsmen, each submarine also had a corpsman assigned to it. We had one corpsman who was a certified diver stationed in the dive locker so, we just let him stay in the dive locker all the time and handle their own medical needs. We had a couple of doctors that were assigned to the ship, Dr. Hodges and Dr. Trevino. Dr. Trevino handled everything that we needed a doctor for on the Bushnell. The corpsmen would actually see the people who came to sick bay, and if it was something serious, the corpsmen would refer them to the doctor, and if it was something really serious, the doctor would transfer the patient to the Naval Hospital on the other side of the island. Though Dr. Hodges was assigned to the Bushnell, I never saw him during my tour on the ship, but I talked to him on the telephone each morning because I had to attend Officers’ call for him. It got so that the ship’s executive officer started to jokingly call me Doc Hodges. Dr. Hodges was able to get away with this because he was a personal friend with the base Admiral and was also the private physician for the Admiral’s family. Rank has its privileges. My most memorable time while stationed on the Bushnell was the night it caught on fire. On ships in those days, trash was dumped into the bilges. When the boat went out to sea, the bilges were blown out, meaning you would eject the trash into the open sea. The Bushnell was equipped with eight diesel engines and, just by their very presence, the engines drip oil into the bilges. Normally the bilges were cleaned periodically because of that dripping oil, but, apparently the diesel engines aboard the Bushnell had not been cleaned for some time. A spark from a bad generator start or something had caused the bilge oil to catch on fire. I don’t really know, as I wasn’t aboard the ship at the time. I was at home, but I was called back to the ship as soon as the fire started.

As I approached the ship it was already at “General Quarters.” I could see sailors off-loading nuclear torpedo warheads and other munitions from the ship to the pier, they were literally throwing nuclear warheads from the ship to the pier. I was later told that the nuclear warheads that were being thrown from the ship to the pier were not armed, so there was no danger of explosion. I immediately called back the corpsmen who lived off base and notified the doctors. The single corpsmen that lived in sick bay had already started the emergency setup, under the supervision of the duty crew. This was for the treatment or recovery of the crews fighting the fire. I next went to the engine room to check on the two corpsmen who were already manning the emergency medical station there. Standing on the steel catwalk above the engine room, the heat melted grooves in the soles of my shoes. We had a submarine tender which was a sub-repair boat that was helping fight the fire and a couple of torpedo retrievers alongside pumping saltwater into the ship. There were tugs standing by to tow the ship to sea if she started to sink. One of the ventilation stacks from the engine room went up through the sick bay. It had become so hot that it had turned cherry red and all the paint had burned off. During the crisis, we were always doing something that was essential, which didn’t give us much time to dwell on the danger. The fire was finally put out the following afternoon. remained at this duty station in the Florida Keys until 1966, when I left the military. I wanted to go back to school and finish my degree. That was, after all, the main reason for going into the Navy in the first place. My wife and I moved back to my hometown of Summit, Mississippi and rented an apartment from my brother-in-law. It was good to be home and we settled into a hectic but comfortable life. In Key West, my wife had worked for the base as a key punch operator. This experience helped her get a good job with Bell telephone and I started into the second semester at Southwest Mississippi Junior College a local junior college in my hometown.

After the second semester, I transferred to a college in Jackson, Mississippi. It was a small liberal arts college, but it had a good academic reputation. I chose the school because my church offered some financial assistance because it was a Methodist supported school, and the University of Mississippi medical school was located across the street there in Jackson. I ran into a lot of prejudice at the college because of my age and because of my military service. I was 26 years old, which was a bit long in the tooth for some of the liberal professors, to be attending “their” college. One professor told me I was too old and I needed to get a job. I did have a job. I worked at the University of Jackson medical center, working in the clinical laboratory at night. Another professor told me that I would have to make a decision between working or going to school at his college. I told him that if I didn’t work I couldn’t go to school. I wasn’t doing autopsies at this time. I would not do more autopsies until I came back to the Medical Center as a graduate student in the Pathology Department. After the first year at “his college” I soon realized that I had made a mistake in my choice of colleges and I consequently transferred to the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I commuted from Jackson to Oxford during the week and returned home on weekends. At the University of Mississippi, I worked for the local hospital taking calls for the clinical laboratory at night. The hospital furnished me with a room and meals and paid me a small salary which I used toward tuition and books. During this time, I got to know several of the doctors that practiced at the hospital. Through the encouragement of one of the physicians who was on the medical school admission board, I applied for acceptance to an MD/PhD program at the University Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. After graduating from the University in Oxford, I returned to my home in Jackson and entered the MD/PhD program in the pathology department. My first- and second-year academic studies were taken with the medical students, with some additional course-work related to my graduate degree in pathology/immunology. It was here that I once again resumed my work with autopsies.

The department had no pathology residents at that time, consequently the graduate students fulfilled the autopsy need, at first under the supervision and assistance of senior graduate students with a review by a staff pathologist. Later the autopsies were done by senior graduate students and presented to interested physicians under the review of a staff pathologist. This was a very enjoyable but intense learning experience. Despite all my efforts to continue my education, life intervened, which is a nice way of saying that I ran out of money. I then left school and went to work for a company that specialized in the development and sale of hematology equipment. After working for this company for approximately four years, I was able to improve my financial resources and return to graduate school and completed my Master’s Degree. I was admitted under the same program that I had previously pursued. Even though the school no longer had the MD/PhD program, previous students could return to the same program that they had left in good standing within a five-year period of time from their departure. I went back to the same program that I had left four years earlier with the goal of obtaining a MD/PHD degree and become a practicing physician. I began to realize that the intervening years had redirected my interest in medicine. The type of medicine that I wanted to practice no longer existed. The intrusion into medicine by large corporate health care entities and insurance companies was beginning to dictate how a physician could treat his patients. I felt that this intrusion was a wedge between a physician and his patient and I wanted no part of it. Consequently, I directed my education toward the science of medicine as opposed to the practice of medicine. Paul, of course, was the other Navy laboratory technician who worked with me during the autopsy of the assassinated President, John F. Kennedy. Paul was not only a good friend but had become a relative by marriage to my wife’s cousin. Paul told me he had been interviewed by two men from the House Select Committee on Assassinations concerning his role in the autopsy of the President’s body and they wanted to talk with me. In August 1977, I received a letter from the House Select Committee requesting that I be interviewed by two of their representatives.

I then received a phone call from a Ms. Bolin, telling me that a Mr. Andy Purdy and Mr. Jim Kelly would be arriving at my home shortly to conduct the interview. I had not thought about my participation in the Kennedy autopsy for many years and was a little surprised by the seemingly demanding request, especially from people that I had no knowledge of. During the phone conversation, I told the caller that I would not allow people that I did not know to come into my home and that I really wasn’t interested in being interviewed by anyone concerning my role in the autopsy of President Kennedy. I was told that this was an official request from the House Select Committee established by Congress to investigate the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Martin Luther King. I was given the date of arrival of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Purdy. After concluding the phone call, I called the local office of Thad Cochran, one of Mississippi’s senators, to verify that the House Select Committee was a legitimate federal entity and explain my concern to one of his aides. Cochran’s aid called me back and told me that the House Select Committee was a legitimate Congress-mandated committee to investigate the assassination of the President and Martin Luther King. He also told me that Sen. Cochran had suggested we hold the meeting in his office and to have the credentials of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Purdy verified by phone with the committee by his secretary. The arrangements were made, and I agreed to meet with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Purdy. met Mr. Purdy and Mr. Kelly on August 29, 1977 at Senator Cochran’s office where we were greeted by his secretary and introductions were made. Mr. Purdy and Kelly presented their credentials and Senator Cochran’s secretary made a phone call to verify their authenticity. Previously I’d been told that Mr. Purdy and Mr. Kelly were counsel for the assassination committee but when the credentials were checked I learned that Mr. Kelly was an FBI agent. This was a little disconcerting to me because I had been told that this was to be a normal interview to acquire information and now apparently one of the interviewers was an FBI agent. This fact pretty much set the tone for the “interview.” From the very beginning, I felt the interview was directed more toward having me confirm facts that they already had a formed an opinion on as opposed to gaining any new or additional information.

They would ask me questions and when I gave an answer they would tell me that couldn’t be right because of such and such. They began asking me questions about the Warren Commission conclusion and about the drawings that were presented by the autopsy doctors. I told them that I had not read any of the Warren Commission conclusions or seen the drawings that they were asking about. They then took me to the local law library and showed me the Harold Ryberg drawings and again asked me questions. They showed me a drawing that seemed to have a flap standing up on the top of the head. I told them that I didn’t see a flap like that on the top of the head and then they tried to shift my opinion as to the location of the head wound to the top of Kennedy’s head. They next asked me about the location of the back wound and I told them that the wound was in the upper back not in the lower neck as seen in the drawing. I was then asked if I could have missed the wounds because I was busy doing something else at the time. (Note: if the flap had been present on the top of president Kennedy’s head I would’ve had ample opportunity during the taking of the x-rays and the examination of the body to see it. I was also sure of the location of the back wound because I HAD PLACED IT ON THE “FACE SHEET”). Purdy and Kelly were continually questioning my answers by saying things like, “Are you sure you saw that?” or “Maybe you missed it because you were distracted by something else,” or “That’s not what another witness told us.” They questioned me about the differences between my description of the brain that we removed at autopsy and Paul’s description of no brain being present. I had no answer for them because that was the first time that I became aware of Paul’s statement that there was no brain. There were other times when they would tell me “You couldn’t possibility have seen that” or “You didn’t see that did you?” I told them that my primary focus at the autopsy was directed toward the large posterior head wound. They came back to me with “We interviewed this other individual who was there” (who I knew was Paul O’Connor) and he said that the whole back of the head was blown out and the brain", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:38:4e78d8eb9c01", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 715, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "there was no brain.

I was asked if I had any notes or pictures that I took from the autopsy. I told them that I had nothing of that nature. “Surely you have notes,” was their response and again I told him that I took no notes or pictures or anything else concerning the autopsy. I really don’t know why Purdy and Kelly thought that I would’ve taken notes or pictures at the autopsy. In retrospect, I probably should have written notes about my experiences that night after I arrived home the following Saturday morning, but I’d been given orders to not talk about or discuss what happened in the morgue that night and I was concerned about the consequences of putting my experience on paper. The discussion continued, and they asked a great deal about the head wound and the body wounds, but they never asked me to describe the wounds to them. They asked me where the head wound was located, and I told them it was located on the right posterior portion of the head in the occipital- parietal area. As the interview continued, the questions became more redundant and condescending. Finally, I told them I had nothing else to offer and the interview was ended. Years later, I was sent a copy of the Kelly/Purdy report as presented to the House Select Committee and a copy of the notes that they took from the interview. The report seemed to be a composite of things that I said intermingled with those that Paul O’Connor had said. It seemed to have no congruence of thought or form. I felt that the material in the report was presented in such a way that sometimes it was misleading and often times seem to support conclusions that it was not meant to support. It often avoided or ignored material that appeared to be controversial.

He indicated to us that he will be applying for a government insured loan for his graduate medical education. Mr. Jenkins was in the service just over five years (serving between 1960 and 1966). Mr. Jenkins began his service in San Diego in 1960 and went on to Balboa Hospital. Mr. Jenkins made no mention of any service in an area near Lee Oswald. Mr. Jenkins was present in Bethesda in 1963 attending lab technician school there. At the time of his training, Captain Stover was head of the Medical School, Dr. Humes chief of the Laboratory and Dr. Boswell was assistant chief of the Laboratory. Mr. Jenkins was a student lab technician (H. N. 4). He had been serving approximately six or seven months in that capacity, during which he had autopsy duty every fourth night. He said his duties include the admission of the bodies to the morgue and the discharge. He said it was normally in charge of most of the paperwork including the body description which consisted of filling in a free-printed sheet which had the body diagrams (the front on one side and the back on the other) and the blanks for the weights and others notations. Mr. Jenkins said he participated in two or three autopsies each time he was on duty, and he usually finished about 3 – 4 AM. Jenkins said the individuals who outline standard operating procedure to him were probably Chief Ewald bacteriology and or Chief Norman who dealt with the academic part of the school. Mr. Jenkins said that two people pulled duty together. He said they usually wore scrub clothes. He said his usual partner was Stanley Miller who was not present that evening for some unknown reason. He said that on that night he was working with Paul O’Connor (O’Connor later married Jenkins wife’s cousin). He said that Mr. O’Connor is presently attending college in Florida. He said he thought he was at the University of Gainesville studying either sociology or psychology. (At this time Mr. Jenkins gave no indication of knowing exactly where Mr. O’Connor was or that he had been in touch with him recently). On the day of the assassination Mr. Jenkins learned of the death at approximately 3:30 PM while in class. He said classes were subsequently dismissed.

He was told to prepare the morgue at approximately 4:15 – 4:30 PM, his orders come in from the duties section chief he said he got there about 30 or 40 minutes before the autopsy. Note: I believe the above statement concerning my arrival 30 or 40 minutes before the autopsy was either a fill-in statement or misinterpretation of Mr. Purdy’s notes. As I’ve previously stated, I first arrived in the morgue between 3:30 and 4 :00 PM. The President’s body didn’t arrive in the morgue until approximately 6:38 PM. Mr. Jenkins said he logged the autopsy number in the ledger book but did not put a name in there. Mr. Jenkins was told not to put the name in the log. Mr. Jenkins noticed that later that someone had written the initial “C” or “CNC” where the name would normally be. Mr. Jenkins said that subsequent to the present autopsy and Air Force Col. and a child were autopsy that night and would have been logged into that ledger book before it was “retired.” Mr. Jenkins said that when the funeral home came in he had to identify the body. He first said he put a tag on the wrist but later said he put it just on the big toe. Note: The above statements concerning the Air Force Col. and the child being autopsied prior to that of the President is totally erroneous. There was a second casket in the morgue that was pushed up against the morgue cold boxes. I had been told that this was an Air Force major that was to be buried in Arlington Cemetery and that the casket had arrived too late to be received at Arlington and that we were to hold it in the morgue for burial the following day. The statement concerning the baby also is erroneous; sometimes late in the evening there was a stillborn admitted to the morgue but it was not autopsied. Mr. Jenkins said he entered all information that he was supposed to on the autopsy form, except for the name. He recalls that he was told to omit the name by either the pathologist or a lieutenant.

Jenkins says he helped put the body on the table (Note: I did not help remove the body from the casket and place it on the table. Paul O’Connor was involved in that procedure.) and started making the regular markings on the sheet. He recalls describing the scar on the back and the chest incisions on either side. He said “… he only remembers a throat wound which looked like a tracheotomy.” He said he thought it was a tracheotomy “… Because it looked like a surgically made incision.” He said he saw a head wound in the “… Middle temporal region back to the occipital the occipital region. (Note: The original statement by me was a description of a small wound in the temporal area just slightly above and forward of the right ear. This statement is misleading; it seems to insinuate that there was a large wound starting at the middle temporal region going back to the occipital area). Mr. Jenkins described the back wound as being “… Just below the collar to the right of the midline.” (Note: this statement is also misleading in that it seems to place the back wound higher into the neck area as described in the Warren Commission report as opposed to its actual location at the top of the right scapula midway between the scapula and the vertebral column.) Mr. Jenkins indicated that he was “… Not sure if I finished…” Filling in the markings. Mr. Jenkins said he located marks on the body before any weighing was done and “… As soon as he came in.” Mr. Jenkins says he believes Dr. Humes attempted to probe the back wound. He said he didn’t believe that Dr. Humes found that the probe “… Penetrated into the chest.” Mr. Jenkins said he believes the organs had already been taken out he said the body was “… Repeatedly x-rayed because they felt there should be a bullet or something there” Mr. Jenkins recalls writing down the weights but doesn’t “… Believe he actually weighed them.” He said the doctors did not redo the sheets that he had prepared to his knowledge. Mr. Jenkins is “… Unsure who did the incisions… He believes Commander Boswell” … Did most of the work.” Mr. Jenkins was not clear as to who may have been giving the autopsy doctors their orders. He said “… A lot of people were making suggestions.” Mr. Jenkins appeared very uneasy about the subject. specifically, he said he “… Was very uneasy about", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:42:e2abafca39f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 719, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "them.” He said the doctors did not redo the sheets that he had prepared to his knowledge.

He said “… A lot of people were making suggestions.” Mr. Jenkins appeared very uneasy about the subject. specifically, he said he “… Was very uneasy about this….” He said he wished someone had “… Talked with me several years ago when this was fresher.” He said that “… With the Warren Commission findings you can understand why I am skeptical.” Mr. Jenkins said that he doesn’t specifically recall any photographs been taken of the interior of the chest. He said he believed that full body x-rays are taken including the extremities. He said he “… Saw them do them.” He said all were taken at the autopsy. He said that whole body x-rays are normal at legal autopsy. (Note: I don’t believe that is my statement. I would not have made a statement like that because at that time I had no experience with or knowledge of legal autopsies.) Mr. Jenkins said that the only thing he found impressionable was that Drs. Humes, Boswell and the Captain of the Honor Guard seemed to be the only officers not of flag rank.” Mr. Jenkins said he was told subsequent to the autopsy by an admiral not to discuss the autopsy. He said he later learned this man was the Surgeon General. (Note: after the autopsy, Paul and I were given orders by Capt. Stover, commanding officer of the medical school. I never had a conversation with an admiral that night and I had never met the Surgeon General.) While Mr. Jenkins recalls no comment regarding the tracheotomy, he said he saw the “… Natural assumption was that it was a tracheotomy, because it was a natural procedure.” He recalls the doctors concern about not being able to find any metal fragments. He said repeated x-rays were taken by a “… Third class x-ray technician.” (Custer) he remembers that if anyone left the morgue they did so with a Marine escort. He said food was brought in. He said he didn’t leave during the autopsy. Regarding the autopsy descriptive sheet, Mr. Jenkins recalls that he “… Put in the chest incisions and tracheotomy.” That he doesn’t think he drew the back wound. He said it was possible that Dr. Humes added to the sheet. Mr. Jenkins said that five or six years later he saw the publication which included an autopsy description sheet which he “didn’t feel was the same one he wrote on.” He said this made him very uneasy specifically, he “… Didn’t believe it was my handwriting.” He is sure it may have been Time", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:43:3fd8bacbb8b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 720, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "the chest incisions and tracheotomy.” That he doesn’t think he drew the back wound.

Mr. Jenkins believes that he wrote on the sheet in pencil. He said it was “… A requirement that it had to be done in pencil.” He said the sheet was on the clipboard which had a string with the pencil attached. He recalls that the backside of the figure was on the back of the sheet and said he had no recollection of a drawing of a head on the sheet anywhere (Note: This statement refers to the drawing of the head wounds by Dr. Boswell on the back of the “Face sheet”). He believes the writing on the sheet would have had to have been Paul O’Connor’s or one of the doctors or himself. Mr. Jenkins said he had no information concerning the destruction of any film during the autopsy. He said he does remember an incident which was probably that. He said it was “… A brief flareup.” He said there was a lot of incidents like that where examined people were “curt” and specifically remembered that the “… Gallery was very impatient.” They seem to be “… Mad about the doctors not finding a bullet.” Regarding the head wound Mr. Jenkins said he was “… Surprised that the conclusions the doctors reach.” He said he was previously at Cecil Field where he saw a person who had been shot in the side of the head. He said this wound seemed to come in the right side above the ear and out the top left. He said the visitors were “… So intense about finding the wound in the back of the head. He said he had a “… Vague recollection of the doctors trying to fit the bones in the head….” He said he thought the bones were already there and not the bones they brought in. Mr. Jenkins recalls Humes trying to probe the wound with his finger which enabled him to reach the end of the wound. He said that around the time of the probing they repeated the took x-rays of the area. He said he believes they examined the organs for any trace of the bullet are bullet fragments.

Regarding the possibility of the chest having been open, and face blood or fluid present, he said “… I should remember… It would be my job to suction that.” Mr. Jenkins was also present for the embalming of the body. He said the embalmers replaced some of the tissue and used some type of plaster molding to close the head wound. (Note: Paul was the one who discussed the use of plaster in the repair of the head wound. The wound was closed by stretching the scalp over the wound and use of a rubber-like material to cover the remaining opening which the hair was combed over). He said there was a problem with the right eye because it would not remain closed. He said this was one of the reasons the body was not viewed in an open casket. He recalls mortician trying to arrange a small skull fragments in the head and believe some of them were put in a small jar during the autopsy. (Note: the morticians were not the ones trying to fit the small bone fragments that we received in a zip tie bag , it was the pathologist performing the autopsy that did this.) Mr. Jenkins says he couldn’t recall whether or not the brain was removed but said that “… It is normally my function to remove the brain and infiltrated it.” He says brain is possibly put in a glass jar. However, he then said the brain is usually first put in a fusion bucket (crock or porcelain) before his foot in and the glass, usually about 24 hours later. (Note: I believe these discussions of the brain are attributed to Paul O’Connor and not to myself. One of the most lasting memories that I have of the autopsy is the removal of the brain from the cranium by Dr. Humes and his giving it to Dr. Boswell and my attempts to place infusion needles in the internal carotids and the problems that we had doing this. The brain was infused with formalin during the autopsy procedure and after the autopsy was finished it was dropped in a stainless bucket and covered. I have no memories of the disposition of the brain after that time. The usual procedure was to place stainless bucket in the little specimen room off the corridor in the morgue for further examination.)

Mr. Jenkins remembers the doctors examining x-rays on the viewing screen to try to find fragments but couldn’t remember where they found any of whether they removed any from the body are the head. He recalls “… A lot of little jars…” But can’t remember the fragments. (Note: these statements are not even related – “a lot of little jars” relates to the initial setup when we were setting up specimen jars for tissue samples before the autopsy ever began. The reason for the multiple sets of _(x) -rays being taken was that there were no fragments of bullets being found and consequently we were told to repeat the x-rays). Jenkins does not remember whether any agents were present; he recalls a number of civilians there and he knew that the Secret Service was there but he didn’t know who they were. Mr. Jenkins said that the cleanup of the autopsy normally entails a proper labeling of the organs. He said this would have been done under Boswell’s direction. He recalls that the body was put in a different casket and the sheets were put in the laundry basket. He said that he and Paul O’Connor were the last ones to leave the morgue. Jenkins was later told that the paperwork was “retired.” He had the feeling that some of it was put in Galloways hospital safe. Jenkins recalls giving a face sheet to Boswell. He is not sure if Paul or he wrote the numbers but he believes one of them did as the organs were weighed he said that the face sheet probably had blood on it. Mr. Jenkins said that the whole attitude in the autopsy room change when Dr. Humes came in. He had a sense that it was very restricted and that he had to watch what he said. He said the whole thing became a “… Guarded type of thing.” Jenkins had the distinct impression that someone in the gallery loss “… Telling them what to do.” Jenkins recalls Humes discussion with someone the problem of finding the bullet. He said this discussion amounted to a “disturbance.” Jenkins had the impression that everything “… Seem like it was pretty designated… Seem they had an answer and wanted to prove it.” Said he doesn’t remember any phone calls being made out does remember a phone call by phone being on the wall.

Jenkins said that “… A lot of people were taking notes in the galleries… Some in suits some in uniforms. He said that “… Possibly Humes made recorded notations (Note: there was no dictation, only hand-written notes taken by the pathologist) …” Of what he saw. (Note: there were no recordings made that night in the morgue that we were aware of.) Approximately 11:45 PM we accompanied subject to the garden justice building the law library to examine the version of the autopsy descriptive sheet contained therein he examined CE 397, volume 17, page 45 – 46. While examine the front page of the autopsy descriptive sheet, Jenkins said that it “should have a Navy number on the top left.” As he was examining this sheet which had a lot of blank spaces, Jenkins said “… All the top would have had to be filled in.” He said the numbers looks “… Like my handwriting…,” Referring to the numbers on the top part of the page. The numbers at top left of the page was stamped or typed in and Jenkins said “… It would be written in.” Jenkins says he believes he hand wrote in the number on the original autopsy descriptive sheet. Re: the writing concerning the head wound on the diagram itself, Jenkins said that it was “… Not mine.” Jenkins said he would have labeled the back scar (it is labeled); but he said it was “… Not his handwriting.” Regarding the marking the location of the throat will, Jenkins said the slit he drew was “… Not crescent – like…” Like the one in the Warren commission volumes. Jenkins added that was normal for the pathologist to sign the description sheet which was not done on the version in the report. Jenkins said all the heights and weights “… Would be filled in…” But said he could “… Not remember specifically” writing them in. Jenkins said “… We would write the starting time in.” Starting time blank was not filled in. Regarding the diagram, Jenkins said “… None of that handwriting looks like mine.” He said that the autopsy descriptive sheet in the Warren volumes does not look like the one he saw in the publication five – six years after the autopsy. Jenkins did not recall a small hole in the head as drawn on the descriptive sheet; he said that the big hole would have covered the area where the little old was drawn on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:47:9ebeab514ad4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 724, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "was not filled in.

Jenkins did not recall a small hole in the head as drawn on the descriptive sheet; he said that the big hole would have covered the area where the little old was drawn on the sheet. Regarding the back wound he said that he “… Thought it was a little higher up, underneath the collar” he said wound itself was “… Below the collar at an angle, and a downward trajectory.”(Note: it seems like they’re trying to move the back wound up into the neck area, in order to validate the Warren Commission’s single-bullet theory, because if the single bullet theory is valid the bullet would have had to travel upwards from the location of the back wound in order to exit at the throat wound.) Jenkins had no information regarding the changes in the numbers in the top part of the sheet. Jenkins recalled that the doctors extensively attempted to probe the back wound. He said they probably use was a metal one, approximately 8 inches long. He said that “… Most of the probe one in… Between the skin…” And not into the chest cavity he said Humes could probe the bottom of the wound with his little finger and said that the metal probe went in 2- 4 inches. He said it was quite a “… Fact of controversy…” That the doctors “… Couldn’t prove the bullet came into the cavity.” Jenkins said the number of the patient on the log and on the descriptive sheet would be the same. He said he thought they may have been a stamp for putting the number on the log but didn’t for the descriptive sheet. Jenkins believe he would have filled in the physical description where the descriptive sheet is blank regarding the color of the eyes the race the hair color and the heights. Jenkins says the chest measurements or the location of the chest incisions were not made by him and were possibly made by Paul regarding. Regarding erasures generally, Jenkins said they must be initialed. When asked about his recollection that the drawing of the front of the body was on one side of the sheet in the back on the other, he said it was “… Possible is recollection from another morgue.” Re: CE 386 (volume 16, page 977), Jenkins said the wound at the top part of the head look familiar but said he had no recollection of that little bullet hole in the head.

Jenkins placed a major defect in the head a little lower than the schematic drawing. He said that the neck wound he recall was lower and more to the midline than that drawn in the drawing. He reiterated his belief that the wound in the back was “… Below the collar line which is what the picture shows.” Re: CE 385, Jenkins said he didn’t see the possibility that it was accurate. He said he didn’t remember whether anyone look to see if the trach was torn. He said that the probing of the back wound was attempted toward the center as indicated in the drawing, said that in actuality only way the probe was able to go and was at a “… Fairly dramatic angle downward so as not to enter the cavity.” He added that he thought the entry wound in the back was lower than that shown in the drawing. He said he didn’t notice any bruising at the tip of the lung. He said that according to his recollection of the location of the back wound the bullet would have been going upwards through the body to have exited in the front of the neck. He said he was basing his impression of direction on the fact that the probe did not enter the body cavity. Jenkins said he believed the autopsy face sheet was essentially accurate regarding the location of the wound in the back. As one reads through the above report you get the impression that it was not of importance to the interviewers. It is fraught with careless errors and it is obvious that there is a lack of knowledge concerning medical nomenclature and procedure. It also is obvious that the notes from which this report was written are inconsistent and incomplete. It seems that when there is an unsure meaning of a statement the fill-in interpretation is always biased toward the conclusion made by the Warren Commission. There are many erroneous statements attributed to me in this interview. I have tried to make the reader aware of the missteps by the interviewers. Whether this was due to bias or due to a lack of experience with medical evidence terminology I can only speculate.

Paul was the only one of the two of us that helped remove the body. returned to my graduate studies and relegated John Kennedy and the assassination to the past. After receiving my graduate degree, I again went to work for the same hematology equipment company that I had worked for before returning to school. The company moved me to Texas in 1980. Shortly after my wife and I had settled in our new home, the company downsized and restructured my home office in Houston. I worked for a subsidiary of the company for a short period of time. I had always wanted to see if I could run my own business, so I set up a clinical laboratory consultation and supply business. The second year we were in Texas, I received a call from an individual that identified himself as David Lifton. Mr. Lifton told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me and that he had gotten my phone number from Paul O’Connor, a friend and my counterpart during the JFK autopsy. Mr. Lifton proceeded to tell me he was working on a book about the John Fitzgerald Kennedy assassination. Mr. Lifton asked me if I’d let him come to my home in Texas and interview me. I told Mr. Lifton I didn’t really care to relive my experiences of that night and besides I didn’t know who he was. But I said I would call and talk to Paul and ask Paul to call him with my decision. Paul recommended that I talk to Mr. Lifton, so I agreed. David Lifton called me back and we set up a time for the interview. I was expecting a simple one-on-one talk with Mr. Lifton, but he showed up with and elaborate entourage of cameras, lights and sound equipment and people to operate the equipment. Mr. Lifton had not told me that he was bringing all these people and equipment. It was a little unnerving to have this many strangers in my home, as I was discussing such a controversial and tender subject.

It was a little unnerving to have this many strangers in my home, as I was discussing such a controversial and tender subject. Mr. Lifton arrived at my house in the early evening with approximately four other individuals and equipment. He was a pleasant man, average height, slightly balding and wearing glasses. After the introductions, the people with him begin to set up their equipment. Mr. Lifton asked me if had followed anything about the Kennedy assassination in the ensuing years since the autopsy. I told him that I would occasionally see something in the paper or TV but that I had no interest in reading other materials; therefore I knew very little other than what I remembered of the autopsy. My wife was nervous about Mr. Lifton’s visit, because by this time she knew of my involvement with the Kennedy autopsy, but I had never discussed it with her. I tried to get her to go to a neighbor for safety, as we were not really sure of these people, but she refused and chose to stay in a back room with a phone. My concern for her safety made the situation more fraught. My interview with David Lifton lasted approximately three hours. It seemed to be a typical information-gathering interview. He started the interview by asking what I’d seen on the night of November 22, 1963 during the autopsy of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I answered the questions he asked but didn’t volunteer a lot of information. I wasn’t really sure what type of information he was interested in. He seemed to be trying to corroborate certain information that he had received from others. To this day, I have never received a copy of the filming or of the dialogue from that interview, even though, unbeknown to me at the time, such seemed to be an established courtesy in the industry, to the person being interviewed. After David Lifton’s book Best Evidence was published, I received a complimentary copy. After reading the section that pertained to our interview, I was surprised about the amount of the interview that was left out, my description of the brain that was removed at autopsy, and the misinterpretation of the story that I told him about a previous experience with a head wound similar to that of the President’s. The book stated that the right side of the head and face of the individual shot by his brother-inlaw was completely missing or blown away, which seemed to imply a shot from the rear.

As I related to David Lifton, the individual was shot from the right front while butchering his brother-in-law’s cattle, which took out the back of his head. I perceive this as the lack of my credibility with Mr. Lifton or misinterpretation of the material discussed in our interview. It was very disconcerting for me and I resolved to limit or avoid any future interviews. Once again, I received a call from a man by the name of Harrison Liv-ingstone, telling me that Paul O’Connor had given him my contact information, and once again, I went through the same dance I had with David Lifton at Paul’s urging. I contacted Paul and he told me that Livingstone was a “good guy and I’m working with him.” I then received a series of phone calls from Harrison Livingstone. Even though I had been decidedly uncomfortable with my meeting with David Lifton, I decided to grant Mr. Livingstone an interview at the urging of Paul, with the hope that I could get my information and the intent of that information to come through accurately. I did more with Livingstone because Paul and I worked together with him. My contact with Mr. Livingstone was always congenial, he was always willing to share information and allow me to review the information given him before it was printed. This is not to say that all information shared with Livingstone was always presented as intended, but there seemed to be little or no slanting of the information toward personal agendas. Most of the mistakes were honest mistakes due to the interpretation of what was said or what was understood. If we talked on the phone, and Livingstone wanted to use that in a presentation or otherwise he would always follow the phone call with a letter stating his understanding of our telephone conversation and asking for confirmation. At one point he asked me to go to Dallas and meet with Dr. Robert Mc-Clelland, who had worked on the President’s injuries in trauma room one and with nurse Bell and others from Parkland Hospital associated with the treatment of the wounded President in trauma one. I agreed to attend the conference in Dallas at the request of Harry Livingstone and the urging of Paul. The conference was an attempt to get the Bethesda witnesses who were present at the JFK autopsy and the Parkland witnesses who were present in the emergency room when the president was brought in.

The conference was an attempt to get the Bethesda witnesses who were present at the JFK autopsy and the Parkland witnesses who were present in the emergency room when the president was brought in. The goal of the conference was to be able to compare and discuss what each group had observed and the differences between their observations. Present at this conference was Dr. McClelland, Dr. Philip Williams, ambulance driver Aubrey Rike and nurse Audrey Bell, who were all present in the emergency room during the attempt to save the President’s life. The Bethesda witnesses were medical photographer Floyd Riebe, medical technicians Paul O’Connor and me, James Jenkins. My interest in attending this conference was to discuss the wrappings of the President’s head at Parkland Hospital. When the head was unwrapped by Dr. Humes at Bethesda, the secondary wrappings after the sheet was removed appeared to be towels and I wanted to see if the towels that I saw could possibly have been placed there as the body was being prepared for transportation to Bethesda. My discussion with Ms. Bell led me to believe that the towels that I saw could not have possibly come from Parkland Hospital. Ms. Bell said that the towels that were in the emergency room were green and that the towels used in the operating rooms were also green, though the towels used in ER were in the process of being changed. Ms. Bell asked me if what I had seen could possibly have been surgical drapes used to maintain a sterile field around a surgical incision. While the off-white or light-green appearance and woven texture of the towels removed from the head does somewhat resemble that of a surgical drape, the blue stripe down the middle of the towel did not resemble any surgical drape that I’d ever seen. It seemed apparent that the towel or towel-like material that I saw wrapped around the President’s head did not exist in the emergency room at Parkland Hospital. However, Aubrey Rike the ambulance driver, said that he saw someone give Mrs. Kennedy a light-green towel which they took from a room across the hall, to wipe the blood from her clothes and hands. Mr. Rike didn’t know if the towel had a blue stripe are not. The conference was very informative in that it gave me an opportunity to hear the description of the wounds from the people who directly observed them during their attempted resuscitation of the President. It also afforded me the opportunity to compare the differences between the wounds that the Parkland witnesses saw and the wounds we saw in the morgue at Bethesda.

My discussion with Ms. Bell about the wrappings that were removed from the head of the President at Bethesda and the absence of availability of that particular towel material at Parkland seems to lend further credence to the possible examination of the President’s wounds prior to being received at the Bethesda morgue. That was the first personal contact I had with Harrison Livingstone. He seemed astute and intelligent and not possessive of his materials like the previous researcher that I had dealt with. At the time of the meeting in Dallas I didn’t know anything about the people I was to meet. I knew very little about the Kennedy assassination outside of the autopsy and only a little that I had read from David Lifton’s book, the letters written to me by Harry Livingstone and the news blurbs one sees on television news programs. Consequently, the people at the meeting were a mystery to me. I came away from the Livingstone meeting in Dallas realizing there were many conflicts in the evidence that had been presented in the Warren Commission’s report, and what the public had been told versus what had actually happened to President Kennedy. At the press conference, after the Dallas meeting, I began to notice an almost manic intenseness when Livingstone would talk about what he believed had happened to President Kennedy and who was responsible for the assassination. This behavior only intensified with my further contacts with Livingstone until I finally decided to break all contacts with him. This was not a lightly taken position, Harrison Livingstone had always treated me fairly and respectfully. It was sad and tragic to see such an intelligent rational individual who had invested so much of himself into the Kennedy assassination that it had begun to take a toll on his health and create a fissure in his personality. I still have great respect and admiration for Harrison Livingstone and the tenacious effort that he put forth in his quest for the truth concerning the Kennedy assassination and its dissemination to the public. As previously stated, I always felt that Harry tried very hard to be fair with me, even though at times I had a slight feeling that our conversations were being pushed toward his personal conclusions. His efforts were more directed toward proving that the government was responsible for the Kennedy assassination and those involved should be prosecuted for treason, as opposed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:54:18d58d1e54f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 731, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "he put forth in his quest for the truth concerning the Kennedy assassination and its dissemination to the public.

I again vowed that I would never become involved with researchers or writers concerning the assassination again. But then came the inevitable phone call from Paul Kelly O’Connor. This time Paul said that a researcher by the name of Rick Russo was not writing a book, but wanted Paul, Dennis David, Floyd Riebe and me to meet in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and talk about what we remembered from the Kennedy autopsy. Russo had said he just wanted to capture what we remembered for posterity on film. When Rick contacted me, he said that his anger had been aroused by Jim Humes’ interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association. JAMA had done interviews with Drs. Boswell, Fink and Humes and Rick didn’t think that they had been truthful. Paul was so enthusiastic about going to Pittsburgh that I really couldn’t say no, so December 1992 found me, Paul, Dennis, Floyd Riebe, Rick Russo and a doctor by the name of Cyril Wecht, who was the head forensic pathologist for Allegheny County and one of the best internationally-known and respected forensic pathologists in this country. The meeting was conducted as others which I had attended, “Tell me about what you saw and did November 22, 1963 during the Bethesda autopsy of John F. Kennedy?” There was a question and answer session after our discussion. I had a brief discussion with Dr. Wecht, concerning the wounds, but he seemed dismissive of my answers. It was also the first time that I had met Floyd Riebe, the military photographer. During the review of the Fox photographs, Floyd had made a comment to Dennis David, “Did I take these pictures standing on my head?” Floyd Riebe thought that the cameras had been turned off and was a little frustrated with the purported authenticity of the photos. Floyd Riebe had taken the first photographs of the head immediately after Dr. Humes had unwrapped the head. Some of the photos appeared to have be taken at seemingly improbable angles. Floyd did not believe that the photos were the ones he took in the morgue that night.

While most of the other information discussed at this meeting was information that I had heard before, Floyd Riebe’s revelation concerning the photos was new and interesting information to me. It gave me a different perspective on the Fox photographs. I had briefly viewed these photos before and couldn’t quite bring myself to believe that all of the photos were taken in the morgue during the Bethesda autopsy. After the meeting in Pittsburgh, I didn’t talk to Rick Russo againuntil July or August 1993. Rick told me that he had taken Dennis of Dr. Herbert Spiegel. Dr. Spiegel had great success in placing Dennis under hypnosis and allowing him to recall things from his past involving the JFK autopsy at Bethesda hospital in 1963. During this session, Dennis was able to recall the names of the two FBI agents James Sibert and Francis O’Neill among other previously lost memories of that night. While I felt this was a little far-fetched, I must admit that while I lived in Texas, I had entertained the idea of regression hypnosis to resolve for myself the haziness and and differences of some of my memories of my participation in the autopsy of President Kennedy as opposed to those of other witnesses. For this reason, and my own curiosity, I agreed to Rick Russo’s request. I will say this, it was an interesting experience. My wife and I were in the middle of moving to Mobile, Alabama from San Antonio when Rick contacted me. My wife was still in San Antonio trying to sell our home there and orchestrate the move to Mobile and I was living on my boat at a marina in Mobile while working for the University of South Alabama Medical Center. Being a little skeptical, maybe even a little mistrusting, I asked a friend who was a professor at the University and lived on his boat in the Marina, to accompany me to New York for the session with Dr. Spiegel. He jumped at the chance to visit New York City as opposed to any interest in what I was going to do for Rick Russo. It was a bad time to visit New York. It was cold, and it was also Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, when people go shopping for special bargains.

The hotel that we were booked to stay in, for some reason which all these years still eludes me, was not available for the night that we arrived and was not going to be available until the next day. This probably had something to do with it being Black Friday. As it turned out, the only reservation to be had was a Ramada in Queens. This turned out to be quite an adventure. We were picked up at the airport by the hotel shuttle service, and as we begin the ride through Queens the driver stopped at every red light and he would turn on the interior lights of the van; after about the third time the driver did this I asked him why, he told me, “There are gang members who control this turf and they want to see who is in the van.” I wished I had not asked. What I remember most about the hotel in Queens is it was across the street from a massive cemetery. After we got to our hotel, the desk clerk, a large friendly, bubbly, black lady with a very pleasant, outgoing demeanor, alleviated some of the apprehension of being in this area of New York. As we settled into our room, a group of young people checked into the room across the hall and started an open-door party. It made sleep impossible and my friend wondered why we hadn’t been invited to join the party. I decided to watch TV, possibly get some news or weather. As I was watching the news, I noticed a slight movement on the table next to the TV. It seems that we had a small furry visitor that was sitting up on its hind legs and watching us. I called the bubbly lady at the front desk and told her that we had a mouse in our room. She told me not to worry, “Honey, we don’t charge for pets,” and we both had a good laugh. The next morning, we were picked up and taken downtown to a nice hotel off-Broadway and were checked into our rooms. Rick had not yet arrived. My friend wanted to go ice skating so we walked to Rockefeller Center where I spent a lot of time laughing at him trying to stay upright on the skates. It seemed to be taking a marked toll on his rear end. I’d wanted to see the rock opera Tommy, which was playing in town.

It seemed to be taking a marked toll on his rear end. I’d wanted to see the rock opera Tommy, which was playing in town. But as we walked back up Broadway to the hotel, I was a little surprised to find that the theaters were closed on Sunday. After all this was New York City. We arrived back at our hotel and by that time Rick Russo had arrived and took us to dinner around the corner from the hotel to a small restaurant. It was reported to be famous as a place where movie stars could be seen. With my shoulder length white hair, jeans, cowboy boots and London fog trench coat, I seem to fit in well. No one seemed to notice two Alabama boys and a Bostonian. I guess it was just New York City. The next morning, we went to see Dr. Herbert Spiegel. We were greeted by a pleasant friendly receptionist and ushered into Dr. Spiegel’s office. After introducing himself Dr. Spiegel began to explain to me what he intended to do. He directed me to a very comfortable chair and began what he called a “relaxation session.” This seemed to be successful, under Dr. Spiegel’s direction I could achieve a slight sensation of floating and my memories would come and go but there was no clarity, there was a sensation that I was an observer and not a participant. Spiegel: Alright, please take your glasses off. Look toward me. Now, without moving your head, look all the way up to the top of the ceiling. Straight up, as far as you can. Higher, higher, higher, now look up slowly, close your eyes, it’s fine. You’re looking up now, take a deep breath. Exhale. Let your eyes relax, let your body float. Imagine yourself floating right through the chair. There will be something pleasant and welcome about this imaginary floating. As your concentrate on this floating, I am going to concentrate on your left arm and hand. In a while, I am going to stroke the middle finger of your left hand. After I do, you will develop movements. Sensation to that finger, then the movements will spread, causing your left hand to feel light and buoyant, and let it floats upward. Ready? First one finger, then another finger, you will have these restless movements develop, your left hand will lift upward, the left elbow bend, your forearm moves into an upright position.

Now, I am going to position your arm in this manner. And your forearm will remain in this position even after I give you the signal for your eyes to open. In fact, after your eyes are open, and I put your hand down, it will float back up to where it is now. You will find something amusing about this sensation. Later, when I touch your left elbow, your usual sensation and control will return. In the future, each time you give yourself a signal for the self-hypnosis, on the count of one, your eyes will roll upward, by three your eyes will close, and you will begin to relax and find yourself in the trans state.

At two, again, your eyes will roll up and with your eyes closed and at the one, you’ll let them open slowly. Ready- one, two, three. With your eyes closed, roll up your eyes and open them slowly. Open all the way. Open them further. Open them completely. Now, stay in this position and describe the physical sensations that you’re aware of now in your left arm. Is it comfortable?

And as you imagine it to act as if it were a balloon. Be bigger, just like a balloon. Let it go, all the way. Now while it remains there, by comparison, raise your right hand up.

Now, the strategy that we do to get to those memories is what we’re going to do next. But, before we get to that, I want to point out something. I didn’t tell you that you have more control, one arm control to the other. You described that. People who have natural hypnotic ability discover that difference in that test. But I did tell you what will cause a control and become equal. Now, even though your arm knew what to do, you now have an amnesia to what I said about it. Now that amnesia is part of the hypnotic experience. I asked you to control it. Why did your control become equal, and you said you didn’t know? Now, you really do know, but right now you have an amnesia to it. I repeat what I said, but the memory doesn’t return. I said later when I touch your left elbow, your usual sensation will return to your left arm and hand. Does that ring a bell? Now, Jim, remember this: did I touch your left elbow?

He came in and asked the first class if everything was ready. It was. There are some people with him, I am not sure who they were. And they left. Beginning to see people come in - I don’t know who they are. Or why they are there. [long pause] There is a lot of commotion in the hall.

The casket was pushed against the - alongside the cold boxes. It was left there. Not much more attention was paid to it. [unintelligible]. Getting some other things, details. I got the clipboard with the face sheet ready. Lay them on the counter next to the deep sink. Still people in and out of the morgue. Basically, I think for - I have a feeling for curiosity they were there. People from the class, people from pathology, Jim Metzler, Stan comes in. Most of these people are being ushered out. Especially if they didn’t have any reason to be there. J: It’s a mahogany type dark - not dark - a mahogany color - maybe dark oak casket. It has brass - instead of having a chrome handle, it has a brass rail on the side of it. There is a dome shaped lid on it with brass trim on the corners. I don’t see anything remarkable about it or distinguishing about it, it’s just very ornate, expensive casket. J: Right. And there is a door at the other end to my right that goes into the hallway.

[unintelligible] that presently have jars with autopsy [unintelligible] on them. J: Above that, there is a cabinet that runs the length of the counter to the back of the morgue. There are various things in the cabinet. Chemicals, jars of tissue, organs, on the top of it, there is a large glass carboy of formalin, about two thirds of the way down that has tubing from it. It’s the tubing we used to infuses the brains with. As I turn away from the counter there’s the autoclave. Immediately to my back is the second autopsy table. Immediately after that is the entrance to the atrium where the cold boxes are. Cold boxes are immediately to the right and the double doors to the left.

Body tags, used to write the autopsy number and place it on the left toe [unintelligible] where the bodies are placed in the cold boxes. Also used to identify them as they take them out for autopsy.

It’s white material - it’s rather bloody. It’s hard to tell what it is. It is really soaked with blood. J: It’s coming from the wound in the head. The wound in the head is really, really macerated. Some of the scalp is sticking to the wrapping. Dr. Humes is separating it from the towels, because he is afraid some of the scalp wound came off on the towels. There is two pieces of very small tissue that remain on the towels from the blood. The blood is still not dry. ( Jenkins sounds a little surprised.) It’s coagulated, but there’s not dried blood.

They’re taking photographs. The photographer is going around us, actually to the left of Dr. Boswell. He is taking the face with the head slightly rotated, the head and shoulders slightly raised. [Unintelligible] the photographer’s finished with the films. He has x-ray people coming in again. They have a portable x-ray, there is really only one technician with the x-ray. They’re taking x-rays of the chest, and the stomach area. They had to raise the body up to do that. The body’s raised, the head has to be supported.

There seems to be some desperation about not being able to find an entrance wound into the chest cavity. Dr. Boswell is back from the other side of the table and examining the wound and examining the lungs. Seemed to be a nice pink color. Someone asked a question: “Did the President smoke?” and [unintelligible] said “He occasionally smoked a cigar.” The lungs are really unusually pink for a man [unintelligible] with healthy lungs.

He seemed to feel there was some trauma force or something there that looked as if it had severed or extended the scalp. In fact, that is how they removed the brain - Dr. Humes brought the brain out, [unintelligible] “It fell out in my hands,” or something similar to that. I don’t remember them ever cutting the brain stem, the idea had always been in the past to try and remove the brain from the spinal cord as much as you can, intact. It very rarely ever works.

If they need something, if they need someone [unintelligible] that’s my job to be close enough to hear what they want. In some sense to anticipate [unintelligible] I know that in order to infuse the brain, we have to connect the needles into the blood vessels at the base of the brain.

It’s about I’d say [unintelligible] maybe two inches of the occipital area on the parietal side in the area [unintelligible] kind of standing looking at the head, it would be the upper left of the wound in the area of the wound. It doesn’t cross the midline. The scalp’s being pulled back up, the bone that is attached to the scalp goes back in there. They’re taking some of the fragments out of the back of the skull, small fragments, and are trying to see if they fit into the absent area that’s close to the center line. It seems to be a long “V” shaped piece of bone from the edge of the wound - edge of the scalp of the skull.

We stripped the intestines, cleaned these, we - there were certain residents where we opened the body up, took the organs out for them. It didn’t seem to be as systematic.

The reason I asked Jim to go under hypnosis is I had already done so with Dennis David sometime before and had wonderful results. Jim, if I remember correctly, wanted to come in a day early to see the city or a show. Unfortunately, the only room I can get him, and his friend was in Queens it turned out to be some god-awful place. I’m sure Jim had some recollection that were memorable. The second night was a much better hotel. I think I came in right around then. I can’t remember if I met him as we were going over the over to the psychiatrist office or I met them there if I met them at the hotel. I can’t recall. I’m unclear about what happened prior to the sessions with Herbert Spiegel. I think we all walked over to Spiegel’s office together. Spiegel was the best in the business Spiegel he was a very nice person very professional. Spiegel had his precursor to the process. Just to see how susceptible you will be to the process of being put under, the right arm is extended and as you fall further under hypnosis the arm rises.

After the session in New York I returned home to Mobile and to work-ing for the USA Medical Center Hospital. I had a brief contact with Rick Russo a few years later asking if I would consider a filming with Nigel Turner, a British film maker. Turner wanted to film me in my laboratory and after getting the administration’s approval, Turner promised the PR department a copy of the filming to use as publicity. The filming was done in the special coagulation laboratory. The incident was a disaster. After the completion of the filming, the PR department never received a copy of the film nor did I, which put me in a little hot water with the administration. In 1998 I once again agreed to meet with a researcher named William Law. I really wasn’t interested in rehashing the same experiences that I had gone over with previous researchers, but as a courtesy and because my wife and I were passing through New Orleans on a trip, I agreed to briefly meet with Mr. Law. The interview lasted two hours. My next contact with Mr. Law was in 2002, when he invited me to participate in a meeting of the Bethesda witnesses in Fort Myers, Fl. My interest was piqued when I was told that Jim Sibert, one of the FBI agents present in the morgue, was going to be present. My wife and I decided to make a much needed mini-vacation of the trip. Since Paul O’Connor and his wife were going to be at the meeting, it would give my wife an opportunity to visit with Paul’s wife, her cousin. At the meeting I was introduced to Mr. Sibert. He was a pleasant, likable, older man. During the meeting, I listened intentely to Mr. Sibert’s relating his experiences of that night in the morgue, but came away with the feeling that what he was telling us had been heavily influenced by his following the case over the many years. It seemed as if he was relating a blend of his own experiences and what he had read intermingled with the government’s official line. I understood that Mr. Sibert had been an avid reader of the case.

In spite of these personal misgivings, I found Jim Sibert a very amiable and personable man, someone I would have liked to develop a friendship with if given the opportunity. 1 After the Florida meeting I continued my contact with William and in 2013, I finally succumbed to his constant requests to attend the JFK Lancer Conference in Dallas, Texas. It was the 50^(th) anniversary of the assassination. I encountered an unexpected wealth of interest which totally surprised me. I was asked to take questions, which I was totally unprepared for. I left the conference with a new perspective. As I traveled home, I thought about the sincere interest that I had encountered. Two years later in 2015, I again returned to Dallas and was invited to speak at the Lancer and Judyth Baker conferences with William Law. At these conferences, I found the same enthusiasm that I had encountered two years before. As I was flying home I again had the feeling that maybe I had been selfish because I had refused to share my experiences in the Bethesda morgue during the JFK autopsy with these passionate people. The commitment to this decision I must admit was a little frightening. I began to read about the assassination because I knew very little about it other than what I had seen and participated in during the autopsy. I soon stopped reading books on the assassination because I felt that it might influence my memories of that night. I began to focus on the attempt to clarify some of the differences between other people present at the autopsy and my own recollections. To this end I began to limit my endeavors to only these witnesses. body for burial. I first became aware of Thomas Robinson during the latter part of the Bethesda autopsy. Toward the end of the autopsy I noticed a rather dapper young man standing against the galley rail. He was dressed in a three-piece suit and was wearing a bowler hat and carrying an umbrella or cane. I was told that he was the mortician, who was to prepare the president’s body for burial. His manner of dress stood out in the sea of dark suits and military uniforms present in the morgue that night. I decided to try and contact Mr. Robinson and see if he could help me clarify some of the gray areas in my memories.

I decided to try and contact Mr. Robinson and see if he could help me clarify some of the gray areas in my memories. I obtained a possible telephone number and address in Winter Haven, Florida but I was unsuccessful in my many attempts to contact him by phone. The internet search of his possible address showed that the property was in foreclosure. I talked to current residents of the several addresses that I was given by the Winter Haven clerk’s office and the property assessor’s office. At the last address I visited, I found a young man who was clearing his late mother’s estate. He told me that Mr. Robinson had worked with his mother in an antique store and at one time lived at the present address but he had not seen him in over 10 years, and the last time he heard of him he was living in a converted hotel downtown. The young man offered to look through his mother’s address files from the business. We only found the phone number for the young man’s present address listed in his mother’s files. During our conversation I asked several questions about Thomas Robinson. The young man said that he thought that the Mr. Robinson he knew was about his mother’s age. His mother had been in her early 70’s ten years ago. This would put Mr. Robinson currently in his early 80’s. If he was 26 years old at the time of the Bethesda autopsy, the age would be somewhat correct. I asked if he knew if Mr. Robinson had ever lived in the DC area or if he had ever been a mortician. The young man said that he only knew Mr. Robinson through his mother and did not know a great deal about him. We returned to our motel and I used the motel’s computer to check the local newspaper’s archives for the last 10 years for possible stories or obituaries mentioning Thomas Robinson. I found a current obituary for a Thomas Robinson in a nearby town, but he was 53 years old and his middle initial was not ‘E’ for Evan. While I was unable to find Mr. Robinson, I gained a little more information even though I could not be certain it was the same Thomas Evan Robinson that was in the Bethesda morgue during the autopsy of the President’s body. Several weeks later I decided to try and trace the origin of the cell phone number that I had, supposedly that of Thomas Robinson.

Several weeks later I decided to try and trace the origin of the cell phone number that I had, supposedly that of Thomas Robinson. The area code led me to Lexington, Kentucky. After using the computer to find Thomas Robinsons in Lexington, I found several and chose those in their late 60’s and early 80’s. I made several calls and was only able to leave messages; I received no return calls. I have recently been told that Mr. Robinson has passed away in Maryland. I don’t know but if this is true, it is truly a great loss for myself and others in history. The people of this nation have lost another person present at the JFK autopsy and his first-hand knowledge of what the wounds truly looked like and I have lost the ability to clarify some of the gray areas in my own memory concerning the wounds that I saw that night. At the 2015 convention I met Dr. Michael Chesser, a neurologist from Little Rock, Arkansas. Dr. Chesser had been allowed to visit the Na-Chesser and Dr. David Mantik approached me to ask if I would take questions about the brain that was removed at autopsy. I agreed and we met for a filmed session and discussed the brain photos in the Archives and the brain that was removed at autopsy. I for the first time was getting answers to the peculiarities I saw with the brain we removed at the Bethesda autopsy. This meeting is discussed in detail elsewhere in this book. In 2017 I was invited to attend a Neurology-Radiology conference where Dr. Chesser presented the x-rays of President Kennedy’s autopsy. He like Dr. David Mantik has been allowed to review the original x-rays and photographs that are in the National Archives. Dr. Chesser’s presentation was before an audience of Radiologists and Neurologists and their residents and fellows. After the presentation Dr. Chesser asked for comments on his presentation and some of the peculiarities seen on the films. The following are some of the answers to that request: 1. The appearance of a large amount of brain missing from the frontal area in the right lateral x-ray. The chief of radiology said that it was probably air, due to the body resting on its back for a long period of time. The brain had probably moved backwards due to gravity, trauma and the malleable nature of the skull. 2. Another discussion was directed to the fracture lines and how some of them would abruptly stop and disappear and then reappear after a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:81:efb6e9a38198", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 758, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "a large amount of brain missing from the frontal area in the right lateral x-ray.

Another discussion was directed to the fracture lines and how some of them would abruptly stop and disappear and then reappear after a short distance. A radiology fellow said that fractures usually continue in a straight line unless stopped by a suture or another fracture line. I found this interesting because if you could determine which fracture lines formed first that could possibly indicate if the first fractures formed at the front of the skull or the rear of the skull. That might offer a clue to a frontal or rear entry. 4. The general consensus was that the faint fragment trail probably indicated a frontal wound, because as it progressed posteriorly the trail spread out. Dr. Chesser feels that there was an entrance wound high in the frontal area. I did not see a wound in that area at the autopsy but it would have been in the hairline and the focus of my attention was on the posterior head wound. The only frontal wound that I saw was the one found by Drs. Humes and Fink slightly above and forward of the right ear. I gained a better insight into the x-rays from Dr. Chesser’s presentation and discussion. I now understand that in the AP x -ray the angle at which the x-ray was taken was not a true AP of the head, causing the apex of the arch of the lambdoid suture to appear in the lower third of the x-ray and not directly behind the nasal bones. This leads people with little experience in interpreting x-rays, like myself, to a possible erroneous conclusion when trying to correlate what I saw and what the x-rays are showing. n April 2017 I decided to contact a longtime friend, Bill Lynch, who was a fellow student in my Bethesda laboratory and blood banking class. Over the years I’d lost contact will Bill but had recently re-established contact through email and telephone conversations. During these conversations Bill told me that he had made contact with a Navy doctor at Bethesda through his involvement in the yearly local fair. This Navy doctor told Bill that he could get us permission to visit the morgue at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. I contacted William Law and William was elated with this opportunity. Bill told me that the Naval doctor had told him that when we came to Washington, Bill was to call him and he would make the arrangements necessary for us to visit the morgue.

Bill told me that the Naval doctor had told him that when we came to Washington, Bill was to call him and he would make the arrangements necessary for us to visit the morgue. This was to be a great adventure, it had been over fifty years since I had been a student at Bethesda and I was eagerly looking forward to the visit. I hoped to be able to answer some of the questions I had in relation to the relocation of the morgue and to see what improvements had been made in the morgue over the years. My wife and I drove to DC at the end of July. We traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains sometimes taking the scenic routes, but primarily traveling on the interstates. It was a pleasant and relaxing trip for us. It had been some time since we had been able to take a long trip together. My wife, an ex-history teacher and current history buff, was looking forward to visiting some of the historical sites in the DC area. We met William Law and his wife Lori in Gaithersburg, Maryland on the 30^(th) of July. They had arrived a day early and had taken a trip to visit Edgar Allen Poe’s grave site in the Baltimore area. That evening we met with Bill and his wife Diane and made plans to have breakfast the following morning. At breakfast we got acquainted and Bill and I tried to catch up on the last fifty years. William asked Bill if he would be amicable to doing an interview with us, Bill agreed, and we established the time for the interview. Lynch: I was a student at the naval medical school command. I went to what we refer to in the Navy as ‘417 school’, or clinical lab and blood bank. That afternoon, our day was in serology, performing surgery on guinea pigs to remove their kidneys to make guinea pig antigen for the mono test. As a student, you get to do the lovely job of doing all that, but we made our own reagents to do our own testing with, which I always thought it was a great thing. I had to do it at Montgomery College, to make your own reagents, if it doesn’t work that’s your problem, you screwed up. But I was also that the morgue watch that day [November 22, 1963] and they came to me sometime around 3’o’clock - I am trying to think - I think it was Key that came down [or told me] “Get down to the morgue and get it ready, they are bringing the President’s body in.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:83:a6b910b08136", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 760, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "great thing.

I saw - I mean there were already people gathering in the hospital, I mean people running around - it looked like a circus was getting ready to hit town. Lynch: Well, I was kind of shocked that somebody had shot the President, but when they told me I had to go to the morgue and get ready, we were on a “port and starboard watch,” which meant we were there from 7 in the morning like on Monday and our watch ended at 4pm on Tuesday. We went to school during the day, and I was on the end of my watch. It was 3pm, I was getting off at 4, and when I saw all the crowd and saw what was going on, and they wanted me to go to the morgue. I said… “I think it is time for the oncoming morgue watch to get to work, so… Lynch: That’s true, and I have not heard from them until Jim called me, how many months ago? (Bill looks over at Jim sitting on a couch next to his chair.) I figured they were both still mad at me, so I hadn’t heard from them in over 50 years! (laughter from Bill and Jim.) We finished up our tour at school until we graduated. And to be perfectly honest with you, we just went about our business. It was just like it happened last week, and that’s it. Lynch: Well, I didn’t “just leave.” (Bill puts both of his hands up and makes air quotes) When I gave them the keys, I had to stay there until 4pm and we had to clean up our lab area. We got everything finished, and went about our routine and (Bill crooks a thumb at Jim) they took off for the morgue. My car was parked - the way I orientate was on the dental end of the building, so I went up to the lobby, like I always did, took a right to the parking lot and that’s when I saw the crowd of people in the lobby, and that’s when I departed, it was 4:30 - quarter to 5.

The crowd was already starting to build outside. There were people climbing all over the - there was like a 3 foot fence in front of the naval hospital at the time - they’ve taken it down and replaced it with a barrier fence - but people were climbing over the fence, on the grounds, coming to the hospital, cars parking on the shoulder of the road out there, and I kept looking at that and saying “Take me home, country roads.” I wanted to be out of there. I just had that feeling that it was not going to be fun there. It was getting crowded, going crazy. Lynch: Oh, well, we did our routine, there were people in pathology doing some tissue work, still, I think the atmosphere was difficult. I think on Sunday, and the chatter that went around, was like they had to process the tissue from the autopsy, like on Saturday and then cut the ribbons I guess Saturday night, or whenever. And the chatter about the secret service being there - when you cut tissue on a microtone, then you run what they call “a ribbon” and then you float this ribbon on a warm water bath and eyeball the ribbon with sections of tissue and you find one that is more perfect than others and you stick your little glass slide underneath it and lift it out of the water bath and it adheres to the slide imbedded in a very thin 13 micron piece of tissue imbedded in paraffin. [The] secret service was standing right there as they were working and literally swept up every scrap of ribbon that wasn’t being used on a slide and bagged it up and took it. Lynch: A typical autopsy the navy did - that we did there, was once we opened the patient with what they call the “Y” shaped incision, we removed the entire visual block of organs which is from the throat to the rectum, pull the organs out in one big piece, as the technician we removed the entire section of intestine. We would go over to the deep sink and with scissors, run the entire length of the intestine, open it up, rinse it out, and like movie film, we used to go like that - (Bill takes his hands and holds them like he is looking up and down at movie film.) looking for abnormalities, ulcerations in the intestines.

And the pathologists he would repeat it if we found anything. We’d show him if we found an abnormality and we would take a small section of the colon, the ascending and descending colon and the duodenum and put them in formaldehyde, you know, the little jars we had with formaldehyde for tissue and as the technician, our other job was to remove the brain and spinal cord from the individual. And for that, we had a stryker saw, which was a vibrating saw, and we would cut across the crown of the cranium and pull the scalp forward and back. Lynch: From ear to ear, just behind the ear, from one ear to the other. First, we would cut the scalp and then once the scalp was pulled back, and then we took the stryker saw and buzzed the skull. We went around the skull and the forehead, and we made a cut with the stryker saw in a ^(†)∇^(p) shape basically as an orientation and to keep the skull cap from sliding around when we returned [the skull cap] back [to the head] and sewed it up. We would remove the brain. Lynch: Yes, basically, you would cut through the dura which is the covering for the brain, and get down to where the brainstem was, cut the brainstem, lift the brain out very carefully [because the brain] is like a bowl of jelly. We had a sling that we made in a bucket, made out of cheesecloth. We lay that brain inside, upside down, and go to the cranial arteries, we had a needle on a carboy, the carboy contained formaldehyde, we put that in the artery, tie it off tight, and start a drip of formaldehyde and that just ran until it firmed up - well preserved - then we went inside the body to remove the spinal cord and I remember we used to cut a “V” shaped cut down the spinal cord, and lift up the vertebrae, and a cord lay in there just like a telephone cable, and it was messy also. We had to be very, very careful lifting that [out.] Lynch: There was a type of scuttlebutt going on around there, I don’t remember anything specific, you know, there was chatter, most of it had to do with how, I think the secret service swept in there and took everything with them - out the door they went.

Some of the information I got came from a [former] secret service agent that used to work for me at Montgomery College. He didn’t know very much about it, as a matter of fact, he was down at the Kennedy house in Middleburg, wiring it for alarms and stuff like that. And when he got the call that said, “You can stop, the President has been shot.” Lynch: They were - Boswell more so that Humes, was a real personable guy. And he was - you could talk to him about anything you wanted to talk about. I worked with both Humes and Boswell. They part-timed at Suburban hospital in the pathology department on weekends. We all worked together, it was a small operation. Lynch: Yes, and I admired both of them. They were both - I think they were both maligned in what the reports put out about this [ JFK] autopsy. They were in the military, and a lot of people don’t understand that part. They were career military. One was a captain and one was a commander. That’s a lot riding on the line. And I think Jim and I have talked about this before - if either one of them had their druthers, they would have done the same thing I did, [laughs] get in the car and get the heck of out dodge. But, being in the military, they followed orders. They had orders, they had people way above their pay grade. Law: If they were given an order - I keep hearing this over and over [that] - they were military. If they were given an order - and I am not saying they were part of anything - this is why I do this kind of work, I try to explore all of the options, and if an answer to a question is not possible, I don’t really care what the answer is, I care about the truth of the situation. So, I am asking you - you know Humes and Boswell on a personal basis, not only in a work environment, you got to know them pretty well. Say there was some sort of scenario from people above their pay grade, so to speak, and they said “We need to do this, for this reason, you will do it.” Would they do it?

Lynch: I believe they would, because we are talking 1963, the military was a lot different back in 1963. Today, 2017, the discipline – I am trying to figure out how to word it and be kind, these folks – today – you know, everybody has got their rights. They got this, that and the other, I don’t think the military people today wouldn’t hesitate to talk back to their superiors. In my time, in the military, if a corporal told a private to jump, he jumped. He wouldn’t question it. I wouldn’t have questioned it. I think with the atmosphere that was probably in that autopsy room, and the people that were above them, they had a lot riding on it. I mean, like I say, they were both career officers, they were both high grades in their grade, and they were close to their retirement dates, plus the fact that they knew – I keep using the word military – I guess, but if the Admiral told them to jump, they jumped. I don’t think they would do anything illegal or improper, but they followed their orders, whatever they were told to do, I am sure if there was a cover up or whatever, I wouldn’t want to be either one of them. Law: Jim brought up something to me that I’ve never thought about as much as I think I know of this kind of thing, now as long as I’ve been studying about it, Jim said, “Say that Humes and Boswell found themselves in the position of “you will do things for national security,” even if they didn’t like it and didn’t want to do it, who were they going to tell? Where were they going to go if they had done [whatever they were told to do] chances are they might be disciplined or in the extreme might lose their pensions, worse, - Jim then proceeded to describe some of the things to Bill that went on in the autopsy room on the night he had chosen to turn over the keys to the autopsy room to Jim and Paul O’Connor. Then, at my request, Jim took the Kennedy autopsy photographs out of a folder and began to show them to Bill Lynch.

Lynch: Besides being in the morgue for autopsies, after I was staffed there, they assigned me a new job while I was working in micro, somebody came up with the brilliant idea of using cadaver skin for wound dressing. They didn’t know what they were going to do with it, or how, but the Navy felt more comfortable with me working with deceased people than live ones! I spent a lot of time down in the morgue doing autopsies as a student. Lynch: The loading dock was just steps away from the double doors into the morgue. Because sometimes the undertakers that came to pick up remains asked for help. Once they loaded them into their body bag, and loaded them on their little gurney, I helped them out the door and loaded them in their hearse. So, it was just out the door to the right, and there was a loading door. So, they brought Kennedy’s body in and just backed up to the loading door and backed it right in. Lynch: They were a light color, I don’t exactly remember what color they were. I remember they were a tan or a white color, and I think the morgue [floor] itself was like tile terrazzo something like that. And then in the cool room area were like asphalt tiles. I don’t recall a 100% , but they were a light color, I do remember that, and they had to be waterproof, because we had to hose the place down. We had drains in the floors. Lynch: Well, that’s where the log book was - when you received a patient in the morgue, you had to sign them in, and if they were new to the area, you put toe tags on them. If they were being discharged, you filled out the log book with time and date you discharged them, and [who] had discharged them, and to whom you discharge them [to]. Like for example, Gawlers. Back in those days a lot of our patients went to Pumphrey’s (another funeral home in the area]. Jenkins: Like I said, one of the only things I remember is, we had the log book, and I remember looking at the log book sometime during the autopsy. The blank was there [for the autopsy number] of course we had stamp numbers - we had a little stamping machine we stamped toe tags and the paperwork with the autopsy number. And then it rolled over to the next number. But there was no name in the [space for the name] only the autopsy number was there.

And somebody had just put CNC, and of course, the next morning when Paul and I left the morgue, the log book was gone. The morgue log book was gone, the casket that had been rolled up against the cold boxes was gone, and the casket that the body had come in was gone. Jenkins: The real reason, the thing that would have been great for me, because all those questions that I have when I saw these pictures, I wanted to confirm. See, first of all the morgue was still the same morgue. After 50 years I think there would be some differences, equipment and so forth. I also wanted to see if it is the same morgue, they probably would not have - when they renovated it, they probably would not have taken up the floor in it, you know, that type of thing. So, that would be some type of confirmation as to whether these photographs show what we remember about the photographs - and see if I remember the same thing Bill does. And Paul remembers the same thing, Jim remembers the same thing about [it] you know. None of us have ever seen a head rest like that and we have done a lot of autopsies in there during the time, the period I was there and you know that was pretty much my main focus. Plus, the fact is, I don’t know anything that happened outside the morgue, because I never left the morgue. Once I went in the morgue, I didn’t come out until the next morning when Paul and I finished cleaning it up. Lynch: I talked to Paul on Saturday morning, Paul and I matter of fact, we weren’t event thinking of length of time as he and I had talked and he wanted to go fishing, and my folks had a boat, and I was going to go fishing with him Saturday morning, and he never showed up, and I called him and they had to wake him up and bring him out and he said, “We didn’t get out of the morgue until 7 o’clock.” He said, “I am going back to bed, I am not going fishing today.” And that was the last time I had talked to him at that time.

Jenkins: When we finished that morning, we were told to go directly to Stover’s office, and he thanked us for the job we did and so forth and he says, “ I have a couple sets of orders for both of you.” and I thought I was being transferred, but anyway it was a set of orders from Naval department and from the Defense Department, and it basically was a letter telling us that we were not to discuss anything that we had seen that night in the morgue with anyone without authorization. The letters were from the Department of the Navy, and the another from the Department of Defense and they were both pretty much the same, except terminology was a little bit different. And we were to sign them, and we signed them, and there was somebody else there that had witnessed them, and these things had the official US Navy seal on one, and the Department of Defense on the other, and they gave us copies of them. There were a couple of suits in there too, so, Paul and I left and we get outside of Stover’s office, and we started down that little area right there, and this one guy in a dark suit comes out of the office and says “Guys, wait a minute,” so we stopped. He said “I need to take those copies” and … I wasn’t going to argue with him, so he took both of the copies and went back into Stover’s office. I never heard anything from anyone about that, until some lady called me, I was in grad school. She calls me and I was in my office, she told me that Kelly and Purdy were going to be at my home on such and such a date. And I said, “No you are not, nobody is coming to my home.” and I said you know, “I have orders against this, and I am not discussing this with anybody.” So, she says, “Well they will be at your home.” and I said, “No, they are not.” So, I got off the phone and I called Thad Cochran in Jackson at that time senator for Mississippi and I went over it with his aide and he said, but have the meeting in my office.” He said, “What we do is when you go to the office, tell my secretary that she has to clear their credentials.” So, I went to his office and they met me", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:91:7c02d17dfb72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 768, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "be at your home.” and I said, “No, they are not.” So, I got off the phone and I called Thad Cochran in Jackson at that time senator for Mississippi and I went over it with his aide and he said, but have the meeting in my office.” He said, “What we do is when you go to the office, tell my secretary that she has to clear their credentials.” So, I went to his office and they met me at his office, so I walked in and the secretary said, “Now when you go in the office, sit in his chair and have them sit in the chairs across from you. Jenkins: Well, Kelly was an FBI agent, and he told me initially he was an attorney for the House select committee. Now Purdy was a lawyer for the House Select Committee and what they did was, they did depositions for various people. And at that time, I was leery about what was going on and so forth. And I had a tape recorder and I asked them, “Can I tape this?” and they said, “No, you can’t tape this.” But yet Purdy put a tape recorder on the desk so I put my tape recorder on the desk, and I think it was Kelly who said, “You are not allowed to do this.” and I said, “Well, you’re going to tape it, then I am going to tape it.” And then I looked over at the little intercom box facing me from the reception and the light was on… so, anyway we started talking and they asked me to describe to them, and I started to describe it to them, and they - every time - said, “Oh, that can’t possibly be, you know, that’s not what we know really happened.” So, at that, I would get really irritated, and all of a sudden, they said, “Well, have you seen the Warren Commission set of photographs?” And I said, “No, I haven’t.” So, they said, “Alright.” Well, they called the Law Library there in Jackson, we went down and they showed me the drawings, the Rydeburg drawings and they said, “Well, does this look like what you saw?” And I said, “No.” and they said, “Well, what’s this flap?” and I said, “The flap wasn’t part of any - and the flap in the Rydeberg drawing was not here.” ( Jim puts his hands up by his head) and so we went back, and they were asking me all kinds of questions, and by the questions they were asking me, I knew that they had already talked to Paul. They were saying, “Well, this witness says this and so forth.” and I told them, “Well, I am telling you what I remember and how I remember it.” I am standing there at the table across the table from", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:92:9b7463d1e8ea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 769, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "here.” ( Jim puts his hands up by his head) and so we went back, and they were asking me all kinds of questions, and by the questions they were asking me, I knew that they had already talked to Paul. They were saying, “Well, this witness says this and so forth.” and I told them, “Well, I am telling you what I remember and how I remember it.” I am standing there at the table across the table from Boswell and Fink at the right shoulder and I am working with Boswell, and the other doctors, you know they were engrossed and I said, “Well, that’s what I saw.” I described the wound on the side of the head and I told them the comments I heard from Fink and Humes and then I described the wound I saw in the back when the scalp was reflected. They just kept saying, “Well, you know, that’s not right.” So finally, I said, “You know, I don’t understand why you are talking to me, and I am tired of this and this is over with.” And so, at that time, Kelly started backing up, saying “Oh well, we didn’t mean to be offensive,” and so forth, and I said, “Well, the interview is over with.” I said, “Well, you know do I get a copy of this?” They said, “Well, we’ll send you a copy.” – which I never got. And then I found out, the interview with me and Paul, was placed under the 75-year deal, well there was an act passed by Congress that allowed access to that and someone sent me a copy of it. Jenkins: So anyway, I got a copy of it, and I looked at it, and it was just - it was a real mess. There were statements in it that were attributed to me, that I knew that Paul had said it, because Paul had said them publicly. They had me removing the body from the casket - which I did not do – and I told them I didn’t. There were a lot of things in it. So then later on, I saw Purdy’s handwritten notes – and I mean, the notes didn’t even correlate with the deposition that they presented to the House Select Committee and I feel like it kind of made Paul and I look like a bunch of idiots… but anyway, I didn’t hear from anybody after that – I did get letters rescinding the orders, but they were specific from my testimony to the House Select Committee, that I still have a copy of these somewhere.

I spent a long time with him Then when he published the book, and he had selected things that supported his scenario and his agenda for how the assassination had happened. Which ticked me off a little bit, but you know… Jenkins: Bill, see I found that too, because you know, I have really only talked to maybe three authors: Lifton, Livingstone and yourself [Law]. And the reason that I have worked with William is because from the very first time that I met William and we talked, he’s never put a spin on anything. I mean he doesn’t have this scenario that he’s developed of how it happened to meld and shape everything. The meeting that we had with Sibert in Florida was kind of refreshing in the fact that when [Sibert’s interview] it was published it was what we talked about at that point in time. Lynch: I looked up on the internet because after you and I started to communicate, because before that, knowing what I know, I guess from the scuttlebutt down there, I do recall asking Paul about what went on and his words to me were, “They told us that if we saw or heard anything in that room, they’d have to mail sunshine to our next duty station.” (Laughter) Jenkins: Yeah, you know, I look at that scenario, to expand a little bit on what Bill was trying to say about Humes and Boswell, you know, you and I have talked about this before, they really had no choice. I mean, they were both career officers, they were getting close to retirement, they had families to support and they needed that retirement. Plus, they needed the job that they had. But, I don’t think it was the whole story. I think it’s - if you stop and think, if they wanted to talk to someone about it, who would they talk to? Because we know that Johnson was controlling everything. It’s quite evident with what he did with Oswald in the OR in Dallas.1 He put in a personal call to the surgeon and told him that he wanted a deathbed confession. ( Jim and Bill look at each other with amused looks on their faces) Jenkins: And see, you’re talking about two people that controlled [everything].

And plus, the fact is if - as I read the autopsy report and go through the testimonies of especially Humes, but also from Dr. Boswell, it’s apparent like he’s put a big spin on it to entice somebody to look into it further. At this point in the interview with Bill Lynch, Jim talked about the head wound and the brain, which is discussed in depth elsewhere in this volume. In further discussion by Jenkins to Bill Lynch about what took place in the Bethesda morgue, Jim brought up the subject of President Kennedy’s kidneys and adrenal glands. Lynch: Well, Boswell told me - we were working together - he was working at the hospital Suburban [hospital] one weekend shortly thereafter and - I don’t know what the conversation was about, or what we talked about, but I guess he was saying something about what a tragedy, and all this stuff, and he was killed and was assassinated and Boswell said, “His adrenal disease was so advanced, he probably would have died in office.” And I still remember that. Lynch: I didn’t know him personally. I have met him two or three times, because he was the Presidential doctor. I guess we got to know him more when Johnson became President. They would come out - they would do the Presidential physical at the Naval hospital. In the Presidential Suite, I guess it was an annual thing that all the Presidents go through. If they are Army or whatever related, they went to Walter Reed. I knew Dr. Burkley through the fact that he was there and we got the orders to run specimens, various specimens from the White House from the Kennedy’s. They were cultures primarily, but I always got a big kick that they came from the White House marked ‘Mr. and Mrs. X, White House.’ You know, like we wouldn’t know who these people were. I guess we were dummies or something. But when Johnson was President, I was on night duty and would have to do and H&H on Johnson following his post-op for his gallbladder. Lynch: Hemoglobin and Hematocrit. They do that to check - just a quick check if there is any bleeding - internal bleeding and stuff like that. Johnson wouldn’t let me touch him, because I wasn’t a doctor - he used some choice words. He wanted Burkley. He told a secret service agent to get Dr. Burkley.

He said to get Dr. Burkley in there, and I had to call him. [I] met him there that night. I guess that’s the only time one on one with Burkley. I hope I heard him, because he said - it was 2 o’clock in the morning or so and he said, “I haven’t drawn blood in over 30 years.” (Lynch laughs at the memory) He said, “You’re a lot better at it than I am.” Lynch: When they took him to the O.R. for his gallbladder surgery, he was on the lab floor where we moved the Presidential Suite, and the secret service and locked us all in our labs when they were wheeling him to the O.R. like we were going to jump out of the lab and hurt somebody. The week that I was on night duty - we did 30 day stints on nights during that period- he came down the hall with a secret service agent and I was waiting on the elevator to go up to do some lab work upon the tower, and as a courtesy, since he was standing there, I just said, “Good Evening, Mr. President,” and he never replied, never acknowledged that I said anything to him, and a night or two later, he was walking the hall, there was some reporters with him, I - guess they were reporters - some folks. I was assuming they were reporters, because when I said, “Good Evening, Mr. President,” it was as like I was his long-lost cousin that was standing there by the elevator. And you know, “How are you doing?” yack, yack, yack. I thought, you know, “Hypocrite.” (chuckles from Bill and Jim shakes his head.) But, you know, the word’s out of him, he wanted to know if I was a doctor, he didn’t want anybody but a doctor to touch him - you know - Dr. Burkley had to come in at 2 in the morning to draw blood on him for a simple little test [on him]. Lynch: Well, basically, you know, that’s their position. Humes was the director of pathology and Boswell was the director of the lab. At this stage in their life, they were both pathologists. The residents did all the autopsies. They were like the CEO of General Electric.

At this point in time, and when you become a Captain or Commander, you are rarely on the front line. They were responsible for all the residents we had there. It was a teaching place. Lynch: Well, no… that’s… I had the greatest admiration for the both of them. I thought they were great people, they were smart, smart people and I think that left alone without all the brass and the hoopla and all the stuff that surrounded them, they would have come to a conclusion that would have been acceptable to just about anybody. You know, I think of the story of a church that had an old priest and a young priest, and the older priest was a golf fanatic. And it was about a week or two downpour of rain and this guy couldn’t play golf for two weeks and he was going nuts. Then Sunday morning he woke up and it was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, temperature was cool, the sky was really blue and he wanted to go out on the links, so he thought for a minute and went to the young priest and said “I am not feeling well, you’re going to have to do all the masses today.” So, the young priest says, “Alright, I’ll do it.” And the old priest got his got his golf clothes and golf bag and headed out the door and St. Peter and God are sitting on a cloud up in the sky and St. Peter said “Did you see that?” and God said “Yeah, I saw that.” St. Peter said, “What are you going to do about it?” And God said, “I am not going to do anything about it.” So the old priest went out on the links and teed up his ball, and he had a pretty good round on the first two or three holes and then he came to a par 5 hole, teed up his ball and the green was like a dog leg left behind a bunch of trees and he hit the ball and the ball took off and started flying through the air, went over these trees, and dropped into the cup. A hole in one. Almost impossible.

A hole in one. Almost impossible. St. Peter said, “Did you see that?” God said, “Yes, I did.” After spending a day with Bill doing his interview. We were looking forward to visiting Bethesda morgue but Bill was unable to conpermission to enter the morgue. Bill was to continue trying to contact the doctor and William and I decided that we would make a road trip to see the National Naval Medical Center Hospital, which is now called Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The Bethesda Naval Hospital had grown considerably in the 50+ years since I went to school there in 1963. The hospital complex now encompasses the entire area previously occupied by the golf course and other open spaces and new construction is still going on. Since 9/11 it is difficult to get onto the complex without an approved reason. William, through one of his many contacts, had been told that the clandestine surgery suggested by David Lifton and Doug Horne to have been done on the President’s body prior to our receiving it in the morgue at Bethesda, was performed at Forest Glen Annex. Forest Glen Annex is a large area close to Bethesda Medical Center which has been used by Walter Reed for medical purposes since before WWII. This hundred-acre plus site was donated to the Army in 1923 and was used as a convalescence facility for injured soldiers by Walter Reed Medical Center during World War I. It was later used during World War II for wounded soldiers returning home from the war. Over the many years it has remained under the control of Walter Reed Medical Center and is presently utilized as an Army-Navy research facility. This facility is approximately 8 to 10 minutes from the back gate of the Bethesda Naval Center by Jones Bridge Road. William and I actually located the complex and timed the travel by GPS from the complex to the back gate of the Bethesda Naval Center. Dennis David, the first-class hospital corpsman who supervised the removal of the casket from a black hearse, said that the driver of the black hearse said they came in the back gate from Jones Bridge Road. This could feasibly be the location where the body was examined prior to it being received in the Bethesda morgue. It was a location that could be controlled by the military. The same as Bethesda Naval Hospital, its existence was not well known and it was only about eight minutes from the back gate of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:98:e947fce63c85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 775, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 99, "text": "the casket from a black hearse, said that the driver of the black hearse said they came in the back gate from Jones Bridge Road.

The same as Bethesda Naval Hospital, its existence was not well known and it was only about eight minutes from the back gate of the Naval Medical Center We also wanted to check on the feasibility that this clandestine surgery/examination could possibly have been done at Gawler’s Funeral Home. After locating Gawler’s Funeral Home, we measured the distance from Gawler’s to the front gate of Bethesda Naval Hospital. The distance traveled by GPS was approximately eight minutes. Sometime later I ran across an interesting article written by M. A. Crouch. It was an interview with a Reading, Philadelphia undertaker by the named of Terry Starr. Starr said that in 1964 he was transporting a body to Arlington for burial and as usual had to employ the aid of a local funeral home for assistance. The local funeral home was Pumphrey’s Funeral Home in Bethesda, Md. Starr states that during his brief layover at Pumphrey’s, an employee showed him the JFK Dallas Casket. Starr also said he was told that Thomas Robinson was an employee of Pumphrey’s and not Gawlers. This story has some credibility because Pumphrey’s was under contract with the Bethesda Naval Hospital at that time and the Dallas casket was missing when Paul and I left the morgue the next morning. The above discussion is presented here only in relation to the differences between the wounds as described by the Parkland doctors and those wounds that we saw during the autopsy in the Bethesda morgue. I believe that the clandestine surgery/ examination, first described by David Lifton and later by Doug Horne, resulted in the longitudinal scalp laceration that has previously been described in the original autopsy report. This working trip for William and me, and a mini-vacation for the wives, was disappointing in that we were unable to visit the Bethesda morgue and consequently confirm or dispel the rumors that the morgue had been completely renovated and relocated. We had been confident that the morgue remained in the original location but were unable to verify this belief. We have been led to this belief by the description of the present-day morgue location, to Bill, by a local mortician who picks up bodies from the Bethesda morgue for burial. The mortician was told by a military escort that “this was the morgue were the autopsy of JFK was done.” This location was also described to Bill by a friend, a nurse, who works at the Bethesda hospital. The body is that of a muscular well-developed and well-nourished adult Caucasian male measuring 72%", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:99:65a850623ddf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 776, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "to this belief by the description of the present-day morgue location, to Bill, by a local mortician who picks up bodies from the Bethesda morgue for burial.

The body is that of a muscular well-developed and well-nourished adult Caucasian male measuring 72% inches and weighing approximately 170 pounds. There is beginning rigor mortis minimal dependent lever mortis of the dorsum and early algor mortis. The hair is reddish-brown and abundant, the eyes are blue, the right pupil measures 8mm in diameter, the left 4mm . There is edema and ecchymosis of the inner canthus region of the left eyelid measuring approximately 1.5 cm in greatest diameter. There is edema and ecchymosis diffusely over the right suborbital ridge with abnormal mobility of the underlying bone. [The remainder of the scalp will be described with the skull.] There is clotted blood on the external ears but otherwise the ears, nose, and mouth are essentially unremarkable. The teeth are in excellent repair and there is some pallor of the oral mucosa membrane. The general description of the body presented in the official autopsy protocol prepared by Dr. Humes seems to correlate with what we saw as we prepared the face sheet. The above description of the position of the back wound would place it at about the location shown in the picture on the next page. This was the same position shown on the autopsy “face sheet.” The back wound, right posterior thorax, was located at the level of the top of the scapula, approximately at the level of T2- T3, between the scapula and the spinal column not in the cervical area, C5-C7, where it is shown in the Rydberg drawings. The location at C5-C7 is where it would have to be located in order to support the entry from the back wound and exit through the neck wound i.e. single bullet theory. The measurement of this wound from the right mastoid process and the tip of the right acromion process seems to be unusual because both of these points of reference are movable and as the body moves these points of reference will different from any fixed point on the body. If the head is bent backward, or forward or if its turned to one side the distance from the mastoid process will change. The same is true of the movement of the shoulder (acromion process). I have several comments and questions concerning the wound in the lower anterior neck, anterior thorax, as being at the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings. I never saw this wound examined during the autopsy at the Bethesda morgue.

I have several comments and questions concerning the wound in the lower anterior neck, anterior thorax, as being at the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings. I never saw this wound examined during the autopsy at the Bethesda morgue. It seems that this location was derived from its anatomical position not from any actual physical examination of the wound itself. We were told during the autopsy that this was a tracheotomy performed in Dallas at Parkland Hospital and not to bother with it. We were not informed of Dr. Perry’s statement that he performed this tracheotomy over a small entrance wound. While it is apparent that the tracheotomy was an emergency procedure, this tracheotomy seems to be highly unusual in that the incision is horizontal as opposed to vertical and the width and location could have possibly cause damage to the thyroid gland which lies below the Adam’s apple. The only examination of this wound that I saw was a brief look under the chest flap during the autopsy examination of the body and its organs. In the “death stare” photo you can see what appears to be a lump on the right side of the neck just above the neck wound parallel to the Adam’s apple. Could this be a bullet or fragment from the frontal entry as described by Dr. Perry at Parkland? This “death stare” was not seen at the Bethesda autopsy. As previously discussed there was no apparent damage to the face when the body was received at the Bethesda morgue and the eyes were closed with the exception of the right eye which was slightly open. This is noted in the official autopsy report. The second wound described above is presumably that of the right posterior thorax, the back, wound and is presumed to be connected with the wound in the lower anterior cervical region, the throat wound described by Dr. Perry as an entrance wound. The points Dr. Humes uses i.e. ecchymosis of the strap muscles of the right side of the neck and the fascia above the adjacent tracheostomy wound would have required a more thorough examination of those areas described. There was no examination of the areas described nor was there any examination of the tracheostomy wound. During the autopsy of the body Dr. Boswell gave a cursory look at the tracheotomy by lifting the chest flap and looking under it towards the tracheal wound. Another point Dr. Humes uses to support the passageway of a projectile from the back wound to the throat wound is not consistent with the probing of the back wound by Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink as previously described nor is it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:101:e3c4692fb1c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 778, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "described nor was there any examination of the tracheostomy wound.

Another point Dr. Humes uses to support the passageway of a projectile from the back wound to the throat wound is not consistent with the probing of the back wound by Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink as previously described nor is it consistent with the slight purplish- reddish area that I saw located on the bottom of the right upper lobe just above the apex of the middle lobe of the right lung. This reddish area was consistent with the termination of the back wound as probed by Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink. The description of above parietal fascia, visceral fascia could have been seen on close examination and at microscopic examination if sections were taken at the autopsy. I don’t remember any sections taken for microscopic examination other than the area of the slightly purplish bruise just above the apex of the middle lobe at the junction of the upper lobe the middle lobe and the lower lobe of the right lung and those taken from the body organs. There was also no through examination of the area described either internally or externally. I heard no discussion of this proposed pathway during the autopsy or observed any probing of the pathway described above. As previously stated the back wound was probed by Dr. Humes and Dr. Fink and its trajectory was in a downward direction of approximately 45 to ${ \\bf \\boldsymbol { 6 0 ^ { \\circ } } }$ which could be readily observed from inside the pleural cavity after the removal of the body organs. To justify the description and supportive evidence given in the second wound section of the Bethesda autopsy report, the back wound would have to have moved upward from the upper back to the back of the neck in order to give a downward trajectory for exit at the throat wound. This is exactly what the Warren Commission did to justify the “single bullet theory.” The placement of the back wound on the face sheet prior to beginning of the autopsy was at approximately second or third thoracic vertebra. This would have required an upward trajectory of approximately 15 to 30^(∘) for exit at the neck wound.

There is a large irregular defect of the scalp and skull on the right involving chiefly the parietal bone but extending somewhat into the temporal and occipital regions. In this region, there is an actual absence of scalp and bone producing a defect which measures approximately 13cm at its greatest diameter. A. From the right inferior temporal parietal margin anterior to the right ear to the point slightly above the tragus. B. From the anterior parietal margin anteriorly on the forehead to approximately 4cm above the right orbital ridge. C. From the left margin of the main defect across the midline and antero-laterally for a distance of approximately ${ 8 } \\thinspace { c m }$ . My first view of the head wound was when Dr. Humes removed the wrappings from the head. The wound on first site appeared to be a large gaping wound in the posterior portion of the right side of the skull. As Dr. Humes was unwrapping the head, the wound gaped open along the fracture lines and appeared to be much larger than it actually was. After further examination and the reflection of the scalp from the skull, the actual area of the wound where the bone and scalp were missing could be better defined. The missing area was located in the posterior occipital parietal area extended slightly into the temporal area. This area of missing bone was approximately 3 to 3.5 x 2 to2.5 inches with an irregular triangular/rectangular shape with a larger curved upper portion located primarily in the posterior occipital/parietal and extending downward with the narrow portion extending downward just touching the posterior temporal area. This wound appeared to be slightly more cephalic than that described by Dr. McClelland but correlated more closely with the wound described by Dr. McClelland than the wound described in the autopsy report.

The wound described in the autopsy report seems to be the appearance of the wound after fracture lines were extended and a coronal incision was made to remove the brain. During this later procedure some bone that was being held together by adhesion to scalp separated and fell into the cavity making the wound appear larger. Situated in the posterior scalp approximately 2.5cm laterally to the right and slightly above the external occipital protuberance is a lacerated wound measuring 15x6mm . In the underlying bone is a corresponding wound through the skull which exhibits beveling of the margins of the bone when reviewed from the inner aspects of the skull. I never saw this wound during the autopsy even though, I had multiple opportunities during the positioning of the film cassettes for the head and body _(x) -rays. I assisted Gerald Custer, the navy _(x) -ray technician, during the taking of the first set of x-rays and I never saw this wound. This wound has been described in later testimonies by Dr. Humes and Dr. Boswell as being below the external occipital protuberance. There was never a discussion of this wound after viewing the _(x) -rays. I believe the description of this wound given in the autopsy report above would have placed the wound within the area of missing bone that I saw after the scalp was reflected. The statement, [In the underlying bone is a corresponding wound through the skull which exhibits beveling of the margins of the bone when reviewed from the inner aspects of the skull], is ambiguous and does not state whether the beveling of the margins of the bone were inward or outward toward the surface of the skull only that the margins exhibited beveling when viewed from the inside of the skull. One must ask, is this an inadvertent omission of a critical detail or is the wound itself a wound of convenience to support a preconceived conclusion that the shot was from the rear? Though, it is possible that I could have missed seeing this wound. I feel that probability is very remote. Therefore, with the inconsistencies of the description of this wound in later testimonies by Drs. Boswell and Humes before the House Select Committee and the Assassination Records Review Board, it is difficult for me to believe that this wound exists as described.

At this point it is noted that the falx- cerebri is extensively lacerated with disruption of the superior sagittal sinus. The description of the brain above is more consistent with the Ida Dox drawings of the brain than with the brain removed from the head at the Bethesda autopsy. If the brain removed at autopsy, had been that extensively damaged there would’ve been no need to try and infuse it. The damage to the falx- cerebri and the disruption of the superior sagittal sinus would have caused massive damage to the vascular system of the brain. It would have also exposed a large amount of the underlying tissue in the brain and the fixation of the brain could have been accomplished by merely immersing the brain in the bucket of formalin without infusing it first. There would have been no advantage to the infusion of the brain. Upon reflecting the scalp, multiple complete fracture lines are seen to radiate from both the large defect at the vertex and the smaller wound at the occiput. These vary greatly in length and direction. The longest measuring approximately 19 cm . These result in the production of numerous fragments which vary in size from a few millimeters to cm in greatest diameter. Received as separate specimens from Dallas, Texas are three fragments of skull bone which in the aggregate roughly approximate the dimensions of the large defect described above at one angle of the largest of these fragments is a portion of the perimeter of a roughly circular one presumably of exit which exhibits beveling of the outer aspects of the bone and is estimated to measure approximately 2.5 to 3.0cm in diameter. Roentgenograms of this fragment reveal minute particles of metal in the bone at this margin.

These fragments were brought into the morgue late into the Bethesda autopsy, by an individual in a dark suit. These fragments were very small no more than a few millimeters and would not have been sufficient to cover the missing bone in the above described wound. The small twist tie bag which contained several small bone fragments and several small metal fragments, was placed on the table by the right ear. There was an attempt to fit these fragments into various fracture niches but by no means covered the area of missing bone. The bone received in the small twist tie bag was much less than the deficit of missing bone. I never saw the three bones described by Dr. Humes above nor did I ever observe any attempt to fit them in the area where the bone was missing. It should be noted that the autopsy report states that these three bone fragments were received from Dallas, but no time was given for the arrival at the morgue, in the autopsy report. It should be further noted that Dr. Humes stated that the three fragments approximated missing bone in the deficit. He, Dr. Humes, also gives the dimensions of one of these bone fragments as being 2.5 cm x 3 cm which is about 1^(′′)x1.25 .” If this is the maximum size of the largest bone fragment and there were three bone fragments, then one can assume that the aggregate area of all three bone fragments was approximately 7.5 cm _(x9) cm or about 3^(′′)x3.6 .” The size of the missing area of bone described by me, Dr. McClelland and others at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, seems to be validated by Dr. Humes’ own statement in the official autopsy report. 2. The second wound presumably of entry is that described above in the upper right posterior thorax. Beneath the skin there is ecchymosis of subcutaneous tissue and musculature. The missile path through the fascia and musculature cannot be easily probed. The wound presumably of exit was that described by Dr. Malcolm Perry of Dallas in the low anterior cervical region. When observed by Dr. Perry the wound measured “a few millimeters in diameter,” however it was extended as a tracheotomy Incision and thus its characters distorted at the time of autopsy. However, there is considerable ecchymosis of the strap muscles of the right side of the neck and of the fascia above the trachea adjacent to the line of the tracheostomy wound.

However, there is considerable ecchymosis of the strap muscles of the right side of the neck and of the fascia above the trachea adjacent to the line of the tracheostomy wound. The third point of reference in connecting these two wounds is in the apex (supra clavicular portion) of the right pleural cavity. In this region, there is contusion of the parietal flora and of the extreme apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung in both instances the diameter of contusion and ecchymosis at the point of maximum involvement measures 𝔰cm . Both the visceral and parietal flora are intact overlying these areas of trauma. LUNGS:The lungs are essentially similar appearance the right weighing 320 g, the left 290 g. The lungs are well aerated was smooth glistening pleural surfaces and gray pink color. A 𝔰cm diameter area of purplish red discoloration and increase firmness to palpitation is situated in the apical portion of the right upper lobe. This corresponds to the similar area described in the over allowing parietal pleural. Incision in this region reveals recent hemorrhage into pulmonary parenchyma. HEART:The pericardial cavity is smooth walled and contains approximately 10mL of straw colored fluid. The heart is of essentially normal external contour and weighs 350g. The pulmonary artery is open in situ and no abnormalities are noted. The cardiac chambers contain moderate amounts of postmortem clotted blood. There are no gross abnormalities of the leaflets of any of the cardiac valves. The following are circumferences of the cardiac valves: aortic 7.5cm full monic 7cm tricuspid 12cm mitral 11 cm . The myocardium is firm and reddish-brown. The left ventricular myocardium averages 1.2cm in thickness, the right ventricular myocardium 0.4cm . The coronary arteries are dissected and are of normal distribution and smooth wall and elastic throughout. ABDOMINAL CAVITY: the abdominal organs are in their normal positions and relationships and there is no increase in free peritoneal fluid. The vermiform appendix is surgically absent and there are a few adhesions joining the region of the cecum to the ventral abdominal wall at the above described old abdominal incisional scar. SUMMARY: Based on the above observations it is our opinion that the deceased died as a result of two perforating gunshot wounds inflicted by high velocity projectiles fired by a person or persons unknown. The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased. The observations and available information do not permit a satisfactory estimate as to the sequence of the two wounds. The fatal missile entered skull above and to the right of the external occipital protuberance. A portion of the projectile transverse the cranial cavity and a posterior anterior direction (see", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:107:88a2a8aba7dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 784, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 108, "text": "perforating gunshot wounds inflicted by high velocity projectiles fired by a person or persons unknown.

A portion of the projectile transverse the cranial cavity and a posterior anterior direction (see lateral skull roentgenograms) deposited minute particles longest path. A portion of the projectile made its exit through the parietal bone on the right carrying with it portions of cerebrum, skull and scalp. The two wounds of the skull combined with the force of the missile produced extensive fragmentation of the skull, lacerations of this superior sagittal sinus and of the right cerebral hemisphere. The other missile entered the right superior posterior thorax above the scapular and transverse the soft tissue of the supra scapula and the supraclavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck. This missile produced contusions of the right apical parietal flora and of the apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. The missile contuses the strap muscles of the right side of the neck, damaging the trach and made it exit through the anterior surface of the neck. As far as can be ascertained this missile struck no bony structures in its path through the body. The above point discussions are based on what I observed and participated in during the autopsy. I was present at the right shoulder of the president’s body during the entire autopsy with the exception when I left with Dr. Boswell to infuse the brain and examine the intestinal tract, and for a few minutes when Dr. Stover told me to grab a sandwich which accounted for no more than 15-20 minutes total. During this period, I was never out of sight of the autopsy proceedings. This is not to say that I saw everything that went on, but the extensive examinations needed to make some of the conclusions listed above would not have escaped my attention and probably would have required my assistance. guess the most controversial part of the presidents’ autopsy is the head I wound. The Dallas doctors’ description of the large head wound supposedly the exit wound was different from what we saw at the Bethesda autopsy, or is it. The wound that Dr. McClelland described to me at a conference in Dallas appeared to be different from the initial appearance of the wound that I saw as it was being unwrapped during the President’s autopsy, both in size and shape, until the scalp was reflected back from the wound.

The location of the wound Dr. McClelland described would have been within the larger defect described by the Bethesda autopsy doctors in their autopsy report. The head wounds seem to create the most controversy when being discussed. This is probably due to the differences between the Parkland doctor’s descriptions of the wounds and the description of the wounds by the Bethesda autopsy doctors. It is also driven by the inconsistency of the autopsy doctors in later testimonies before various government investigative committees. I first saw the head wound when Dr. Humes unwrapped the sheet and towel from the head. The wound was adhered to the towel-like material by dried blood and fluids and gaped open along a laceration that ran forward toward the anterior portion of the head, which immediately closed after the wrappings were separated from the head-wound gore. The scalp was torn and macerated with fractured bone fragments still clinging to the scalp. The entire area was covered with matted hair and dried blood. This made it difficult to determine the true extent of the wound. This made it appeared to be a massive “blowout” of the back of the head, but after the scalp was reflected back from the skull, the wound that had missing scalp and bone appeared to be more consistent with the shape and dimensions previously described by Dr. McClelland. The wound, missing bone and scalp, was a large gaping wound in the occipital-parietal area of the right posterior side of the head. It looked to be about 2.5 to 3 inches (5 to 7cm ) by 1.5 to 2 inches (3 to 5cm ) in size with a rounded border at the top traveling downward in an elongated, rectangular/triangular shape with irregular margins. This irregular shape made it difficult to approximate the true diminutions of the missing bone area. This area was better defined when the scalp was reflected back from the skull. There was also a laceration of the scalp extending anteriorly from the upper frontal area of the wound (missing bone and scalp area) parallel to the sagittal suture, midline of the skull, and ending slightly past the coronal suture almost into the frontal bone. This scalp laceration closely followed underlying fracture lines of the skull. The scalp laceration resembled the other tears in the scalp created by the bullet, with one exception, there seemed to be neat, clean connections between several tears as if the tears had been surgically connected. This was the area that prompted Dr. Humes to ask someone", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:109:4a6419498edc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 786, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 110, "text": "scalp area) parallel to the sagittal suture, midline of the skull, and ending slightly past the coronal suture almost into the frontal bone. This scalp laceration closely followed underlying fracture lines of the skull. The scalp laceration resembled the other tears in the scalp created by the bullet, with one exception, there seemed to be neat, clean connections between several tears as if the tears had been surgically connected. This was the area that prompted Dr. Humes to ask someone in the gallery if there had been any surgery performed at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. Dr. Humes was told there had been no surgery at Parkland. The 2.5 to 3 inches (5 to 7cm ) by 1.5 to 2 inches (3 to 5cm) ) is not consistent with the description of 13cms ( 5+ inches) which appears in the official autopsy report or the 17/19 cms (6.7/7.6 inches) described by Dr. Boswell in later testimony. The wound described in the autopsy report is more consistent with the appearance of the wound after the fracture lines and tears of the scalp and skull had been surgically extended and a coronal incision had been made to remove the brain by Dr. Humes as described to Dr. Fink by Dr. Humes. This is supported by Dr. Finks’ report to Gen. Blumberg, when he, Dr. Fink, says that Dr. Humes told him that he, Dr. Humes, only had to extend some of the tears in the scalp, which were holding the fractured skull together, in order to remove the brain. I believe that Dr. Fink was present in the morgue when the head was unwrapped, which makes the Blumberg report questionable. I am sure he was present in the morgue before the brain was removed because the brain was still in the cranium when he, Dr. Fink and Dr Humes found the right temple wound. This supports Dr. Humes’ statement that he only had to extend scalp tears to remove the brain. I think it is only fair to say that my given measurements 2.5 to 3 inches (5 to 7cm ) by 1.5 to 2 inches (3 to 5cm ) of the wound, missing bone and scalp area, are approximations and not measured ones, even though the difference between 3 inches and 5 inches is obvious to most people. My given measurements also approximated more closely the diminutions given by Dr. McClelland at Parkland as he observed the wound in the emergency room than those listed in the official autopsy report. This is the wound drawing that Dr. McClelland made to illustrate the wound he saw at Parkland in 1963. This closely matches the wound that I saw after the scalp was retracted from the skull.

The area shown was the area where both bone and scalp were missing. While some bone was separated from the scalp as it was being refracted, you could still readily see the true area where there was an absence of bone and scalp. My original thought when I first saw this drawing was that the wound appeared to be a little more caudal, toward the neck, and lateral than the wound seen at autopsy. This may be perception on my part due to the slightly turned head in the drawing. The position of the wound in the drawing correlates well with the wound that I saw at autopsy after the scalp was retracted. The above placement of wounds by Dr. Crenshaw and Ms. Audrey Bell for the record review board demonstrates a variance that one can see as individuals review and remember specific events. The top two placements of the head wound by Dr. Crenshaw more closely correlate with the location of the wound seen at autopsy after the scalp was reflected. Though there seems to be a conflict between the placement at the rear of the skull and the attempt to place the wound on the lateral or side of the skull. I believe this conflict is due to the difficulty of observing an irregular wound on the posterior portion of the skull and trying to relate that to its appearance from the lateral view. The bottom drawings are those in which Ms. Audrey Bell attempted to place the head wounds. While the drawing on the left that depicts the head, wound appears to be more caudal, toward the bottom of the head, than that seen at autopsy. I believe the conflict described above is relative to the same difficulty that accounted for the conflict by Dr. Crenshaw. While Ms. Bell’s placement of the wound at the back of the head appears to be lower than that seen in autopsy it is difficult to place a wound that is primarily in the posterior of the skull from the lateral view. The difficulty arises due to the skull being rounded and that the wound would probably have a different appearance from the lateral (side) view. There’s been much discussion about the head wound by Douglas Horne in his interview with William Law.

The only problem with this theory is that I was present in the morgue all of the time from approximately 3:30PM Friday until 9:00AM Saturday, the following morning. If Dr. Humes and Dr. Boswell did Mr. Horne’s “illicit” surgery then it would have had to have been done outside the morgue at another facility prior to 6:35PM, which is the time the body arrived at the morgue as given by Dennis David and collaborated by Sgt. Boyajian’s action report which was later supported by William Law’s conversation with Dr. Jay Cox, the Officer of the Day for the Bethesda Hospital. I have no direct knowledge of whether Dr. Humes or Dr. Boswell performed Mr. Horne’s “illicit” surgery. The only thing that I know for sure is that it was not done in the Bethesda morgue between 3:30 PM and 9:00 AM the following morning, though I agree with Mr. Horne that the wounds were examined somewhere between Parkland and Bethesda.

The above description of the damage to the brain would be readily discernible on first observation. The above states that the right cerebral hemisphere is severely damaged and that there is a longitudinal laceration that is parallel to the top of the brain. This laceration is located approximately 2.5 cm (1in) to the right side of the midline extending approximately 4.5 cm (1.8 in) through the gray matter into the underlying white matter. The description additionally states there is a considerable loss of cortical substance above the base (bottom) of the laceration. This statement would lead you to assume that a large portion of the right side of the brain was missing , which would support the descriptions of the Dallas Doctors and possibility support Paul O’Connor’s and Jim Sibert’s statement that there was no brain. This was not the description of the brain that was removed at the Bethesda autopsy. The report further describes damage to the interior structures, a laceration of the Corpus Callosum from the genu to the tail ( front to back) which exposes through the interiors of the right lateral and third ventricles. These structures are deep internal structures of the brain and would be exposed only by extensive damage of the brain. I have serious questions about this description. First, the weight given for the brain is slightly above the 1200 grams to 1300 grams of the average adult brain. How could there be a considerable loss of cortical substance above the base of the described longitudinal laceration and still maintain a brain weight of greater than average. Some may argue that the weigh could be the result of an inadequate fixation with not enough time to equilibrate. This could well account for the weight given if the President’s brain had suffered the extensive damage described above and had then been placed in formalin without infusion and autopsied two or three days later without adequate time to equilibrate. We usually infused the brains that we took at autopsy before they were placed in formalin. This procedure produced a faster and more through fixation and equilibration than the usual submersion in a container of buffered formalin for 7-10 days. The above discussion of the left side of the brain tells us that the massive damage seen on the right was not seen on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:113:8b036e1d7ce0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 790, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 114, "text": "in formalin without infusion and autopsied two or three days later without adequate time to equilibrate.

The above discussion of the left side of the brain tells us that the massive damage seen on the right was not seen on the left side of the brain. There was only engorgement of blood vessels and considerable subarachnoid bleeding. It also tells us that the gyri and sulci, the convolutions of the brain surface, on the left side are essentially of normal size and distribution and those on the right side were too damaged to describe. You may be wondering why I have gone over this already published information. I have done this to prepare you for the information that I am about to discuss. This is not a description of the brain that was removed from the President’s body by Dr. Humes, given to Dr. Boswell and which I attempted to insert the infusion needles to fix the brain. A brain in this condition would not have benefited from the infusion technique due to the massive disruption of the vascular system of the brain. The infiltration of the brain tissue would have been just as effective by immersing it in a container of formalin due to the vast area of cellular tissue that would have been exposed by the massive trauma as described in the above supplemental autopsy report. The massive disruption as described in this report would not have allowed the retention in the brains vasculature long enough to have been effective. A.

And None of The Sections Examined Are There Significant Abnormalities Other Than Those Directly Related to The Recent Trauma. Sections through the wounds in the occipital and upper right posterior thoracic regions are essentially similar. In each there is loss of continuity of the epidermis with coagulation necrosis of the tissues at the wound margins. The scalp wound exhibits several small fragments of bone at its margins in the subcutaneous tissue. I’ve been asked many times about the Fox photographs that are seen today in the public domain. It’s difficult for me to comment on these photographs because none of them seem to be consistent with my memories of the body in the Bethesda morgue that night. There seems to be inconsistencies in all of the photographs which make me believe that theys may not have been taken during the Bethesda autopsy. My third comment concerns the whitish tag-like spot located in the lower part of the head in the hair line. Many have identified this as an entry wound in the head as described in the official autopsy report. It appears to me that the protruding tissue could possibly be from the fatty tissue layer beneath the scalp. The protrusion of this tissue could indicate that it was pushed from the inside to the outside by the exit of a fragment rather than the entry of a bullet. I enter this possibility only as a thought, because I never saw the back-entry head wound described in the official autopsy report though I had ample opportunity when we were moving the head for placement of the x-rays plates. As in most of the fox photographs, the anatomical reference points are masked. While I cannot say definitely that this is a photograph taken at the Bethesda autopsy, the horns of an autopsy head chock are seen just above the gloved hand holding the scalp up. This was the type of head chock used at our routine autopsies. This photograph has been termed the “mystery photo” because of the difficulty in orientation due to the lack of visible anatomical points. While I believe this is a photo of the posterior head wound after the brain was removed and the scalp was reflected from the wound I cannot be sure. The wound seems to be larger than when I first saw it when the head was unwrapped. I believe that the original wound with the missing bone and scalp could still be defined within this larger deficit. It also seems that the rear-entry head wound would also fall within this area.

It also seems that the rear-entry head wound would also fall within this area. I feel that the larger appearance was caused by bone fragments separated from the scalp as the scalp was reflected. Another contribution to the larger deficit would be the incisions connecting scalp laceration when the brain was removed. I have talked with Dr. Chesser about this photo and the lack of my ability to orient it. Dr. Chesser has tried to help with my orientation but I am still not comfortable with my ability to do so. Dr. Chesser has been allowed to view the photos in the National Archives which I have been refused. Dr. Chesser has been able to orient the photograph from discernable anatomical points seen on the original photographs. There also appears to be some kind of structure over the body if that is a dissection table or a mayo instrument stand this is not a photograph taken in the Bethesda morgue during the autopsy. In this photograph there is no sign that the autopsy of the body has started. I only placed the dissection board over the table after the body cavity had been opened and we were ready to remove the body organs. This photograph like the others presents questions for me. I watched Dr. Humes unwrap the head and I never saw this death stare on the face of the President’s face. As previously discussed the left eye was closed and the right eyes was slightly open which the mortician closed with a small suture under the lid. The lips were slightly open. As I viewed this photograph, I noticed a raised area on the throat parallel to the Adam’s apple (circled area on side of neck). Upon closer scrutiny, this appears to be possibly something inside the tissue of the neck, a bullet or fragment from the throat wound which was described by Dr. Malcolm Oliver Perry in Dallas as an entry wound. If one looks closely, it appears that there could be the imprint of a tunneling from the right side of the throat wound, where Dr. Perry described the entry wound over which he did the tracheotomy, to the raised area on the neck. The second notable mark seen in this photograph is on the left shoulder. I am unsure as to what this mark is and I use it only to make the case that if any of these marks had been found during the initial examination of the body in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:116:d781afbdb25f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 793, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "imprint of a tunneling from the right side of the throat wound, where Dr. Perry described the entry wound over which he did the tracheotomy, to the raised area on the neck.

I am unsure as to what this mark is and I use it only to make the case that if any of these marks had been found during the initial examination of the body in the Bethesda morgue, they would have been listed on the face sheet Dr. Boswell and I completed. In the above photograph, you see the head being held in a metal cradle that is attached to the head of presumably the Bethesda autopsy table. This cradle not only seems to elevate the head but also the shoulders above the table. There also appears to be a wrinkling of the neck in the back as if the head had been pulled backwards from the body and it appears in this photograph that the body is so rigid, due to rigor mortis, that the elevation of the head also elevates the shoulder and upper chest. I remember that Dr. Fink and Dr. Humes were able to elevate the upper body to a partially sitting position as they were probing the back wound. During the initial face sheet examination, Dr. Boswell and I also had no difficulties related to an extreme rigor mortis as depicted in this photograph. There are other things about this photograph that make me question if it was taken in the Bethesda morgue during the autopsy. I have no memories of such a metal cradle being used to support the head during any of the autopsies that I assisted with. I am not sure if the autopsy table had a place to attach such a head rest and I do not remember a telephone on that side wall. The telephone I remember was located by the deep sink just inside the passageway leading to the tissue room, linen room and the locker room in the back of the morgue. I specifically remember the location of the telephone because it had an extremely long curly cord to allow it to reach anywhere in the morgue proper.

This photograph is of the back wound that was located at the apex of the scapular midway between the scapular and spinal column. In this photo the true location is difficult to see because the apex, top, of the scapula seems to be obscured by a bright light. The top wound seems to be higher in the back than it really was because the neck seems to be pushed backwards. The wound appears to be in the approximate location seen at autopsy and placed on the face sheet. The first was the casket that the president’s body arrived in. This memory was striking in that this casket appeared to be a common transport casket, not one that you would expect a president’s body to arrive in. I remember this casket being brought just inside the morgue from the anteroom, where the cold boxes were located, and placed on the floor. My memory is that the body was removed from the casket, placed on a gurney and brought to the front table. This is a tentative memory because I didn’t directly participate in the removal of the body from the casket or transporting it to the front table. Paul O’Connor, my counterpart, was directly involved in this process. Paul says that the casket was brought into the morgue and placed on the floor and the body was moved directly to the table from the casket. In our normal movement of bodies from the anteroom to the autopsy table, we would place the body on a gurney and move the gurney to the autopsy table, this may account for the possibility that my memory is merging the normal event with the event in the morgue that night. The second casket that I remember from that night was a burial casket that was pushed up against the cold boxes in the anteroom. This casket was a highly polished high-end burial casket reddish in color. The colors in these descriptions may be biased due to my red-green color blindness that gives me problems with different hues of reds which often appear as shades of brown and greens that often appear as shades of gray. When I first noticed this casket, I asked the First- Class Hospital Corpsman, who I believe was the duty Chief of the Day for the laboratory, about the casket and was told that the casket contained an Air Force major who was to be buried in Arlington the next day and had arrived too late to be received there. He said we were going to hold the casket for burial the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:118:fc2ed644be6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 795, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "and greens that often appear as shades of gray.

He said we were going to hold the casket for burial the next day. As I learned later, there are no military burials at Arlington on the weekends and the next day was Saturday. This second casket is the one that holds the most uncertainty for me. In 2015 I attended a meeting in Chicago organized by Phil Singer and William Law. Phil had been able to find several of the Honor Guard members and had invited them along with me, Dennis David, Jim Metzler and several others to meet and discuss the arrival of the casket at the Bethesda morgue. After talking with the honor guard members and hearing their account of the casket arrival, I had come to accept that this was probably the casket that the honor guard removed from the Navy ambulance and brought to the anteroom door as described by several members of the honor guard at the conference. I have a vague memory of the head of a casket entering through the morgue doors from the hall into the anteroom with two members of the honor guard. I don’t remember if the casket was brought into the ante-room or if it was just pushed through the doors. At the time, I was busy working with the doctors at the autopsy table. I could see the double doors that entered the ante-room from the hallway through the door that connected the ante-room to the morgue. It was just a cursory glance. During a later discussion with Hugh Clark, one of the Honor Guard members, I was able to identify the Honor Guard members that I saw with the casket entering the morgue door as James Felder(Army) and Tim Cheek (Marine). While I now believe that the unclear memory described above is related to the casket that the honor guard removed from the Navy ambulance and brought to the morgue, I cannot be positive that the casket I saw pushed up against the cold boxes in the ante-room is the same casket that the honor guard delivered to the morgue. Never-the-less, I can say that the casket delivered to the morgue did not contain the President’s body. The autopsy had begun some time before that delivery. While reviewing some tape sessions of the Dallas conference organized by Harry Livingstone and a session in New York organized by Rick Russo I stated that my memory of the arrival of the casket that I saw against the cold boxes was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:119:4e29d487995a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 796, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "is the same casket that the honor guard delivered to the morgue.

While reviewing some tape sessions of the Dallas conference organized by Harry Livingstone and a session in New York organized by Rick Russo I stated that my memory of the arrival of the casket that I saw against the cold boxes was prior to the arrival of the casket with the President’s body. If this is the case, then the casket that Paul and I saw in the ante-room against the cold boxes cannot possibly have been the casket that was removed from the Navy ambulance by the honor guard. This may also give some credence to some researchers’ “musical chairs” scenario of caskets, necessary to cover the multiple reported entrances of caskets into the morgue. While I cannot say that my original memory of the arrival of the casket that was in the ante-room against the cold boxes was in error or that recent conversations with Dennis David and the honor guard member have influenced my current thoughts. I can say that the President’s body was brought into the morgue in a shipping/transport type of casket and the body never left the morgue after it was placed on the autopsy table. The caskets could have been removed and replaced while I was busy with the body in the morgue proper, but if that was the case there would have been a lot of witnesses. The last casket is one that I have a very explicit memory of, this was the casket that the President’s body was placed in and removed from the morgue by the honor guard after the autopsy had ended and the mortician had finished preparing the body for burial. This casket was a large ornate mahogany burial casket appropriate to contain the body of the President of the United States. It was brought into the morgue sometime around midnight by Gawler’s Funeral Home personnel and after the mortician had finished preparing the body, Paul and I helped the mortician dress the body and with the help of several others present, we placed the President’s body in the casket. The casket was closed, and the Honor Guard removed it from the morgue. The reader can get a better description of the transport casket that the body arrived in by reading Paul O’Connor’s description given to and published by several research authors. Paul would have gotten a better view of the casket because he was directly involved in the removal of the body from that casket. I only saw the casket from a distance and was struck by the fact that it seemed to be an ordinary shipping casket.

I feel that it is critically important and this information should be presented to the general public. I hesitated to ask Dr. Chesser to share this information and was pleasantly surprised when he enthusiastically agreed to write this chapter, for which I am very grateful. would like to thank James Jenkins for asking me to contribute to this book. I met James at the JFK Lancer meeting in Dallas in 2015, and I enjoyed visiting with him, as we have much in common, growing up in the South, and serving in Navy medicine. I was initially awed by his experience at the autopsy of the President, and since getting to know him, I’ve found him to be a very humble, intelligent, and thoughtful man. He is clear headed, and not prone to exaggeration or embellishment. I know that he loves his country, as I do, and I believe that his story is incredibly important for our nation’s history, and for future generations to be able to understand the events of November 22^(nd) , 1963. I’m always curious about the various reasons that people have for their interest in the assassination, so I’ll briefly tell about my reasons. In James Jenkins’ case, he had no choice in the matter, as he was under orders in the Navy. In my case, I volunteered for this, which might cause some to question my sanity. My interest goes back to childhood, when President Kennedy was one of my heroes, knowing about his courage in rescuing his shipmate after PT 109 was sunk. Later in life I realized how his policies, both domestic and international, were transformational, and it took an unbelievable amount of courage for him to propose many of these policies in the early 60’s. After reading JFK and the Unspeakable, by James Douglass, I was so curious that I attended the conference on the 50^(th) anniversary of the Warren Commission conference in Bethesda, Maryland, in 2013. Many of the attendees there encouraged me to try and view the autopsy materials, after they found out that I’m a neurologist. I was eventually approved, and I made three visits to the National Archives II in College Park, Maryland, where the autopsy materials are stored.

If there is only one thing that you know about the medical evidence, it should be this – two government sponsored medical panels overruled the military pathologists who performed the autopsy at Bethesda, and they moved the location of the skull entry wound from the lower occipital area over 4 inches up to the posterior parietal area (figure 1). Let that sink in – the military pathologists who saw the skull and brain, and explored the wounds during the autopsy, were told that they were wrong. They were told that they could not possibly have recorded the correct entry location in the back of the skull, and the entry location was moved up four and a half inches, to the top of the back of the skull. The two government-sponsored medical panels were the Clark Panel, in 1967, and the medical panel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, which followed suit a decade later. There is no way that the importance of this can be overstated. How can a group of physicians overrule the pathologists who examined the body? What this tells us is that there was something seriously wrong with the medical evidence. I will try to describe this in more detail, and I will try to explain why I think the pathologists were overruled, and why they were told that they could not believe what their eyes told them. I will show why a standard forensic analysis of these skull x-rays shows that a minimum of 2 bullets struck the skull of the President, with the first striking the right lower occiput, and the second striking high in the right frontal region, in an area which was covered by hair and would have been easily missed by the Parkland ER team. I reviewed the purported original cranial autopsy x-rays of President Kennedy, and the computer enhanced x-rays produced for the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, at the National Archives II on April 22, 2015. I reviewed the original 1960 skull x-ray at the Presidential Library near Boston, where it is labeled as a sinus x-ray.

The x -ray images included with this review (Images 2,3,5-7) were published in the report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978² . My review of the x -ray films revealed details which are not visible on these public images. This review will document the differences between the actual films and the attached images, and lastly will include my conclusions. The autopsy of President Kennedy was performed in the morgue of the Bethesda Naval Hospital during the evening of November 22^(nd) , 1963. Commander James J. Humes, the lead pathologist for the autopsy, testified to the Warren Commission that the skull x-rays were made before the autopsy examination began. He stated that “before the postmortem examination was begun, anterior, posterior and lateral x-rays of the head, and of the torso were made”3 . Dr. James H. Ebersole was the radiologist on duty during the autopsy, and the radiologic technicians were hospital corpsmen Jerrol F. Custer and Edward F. Reed4 . There was no professional interpretation of the skull x-rays published with the Warren Report. The autopsy report notes only that the x-rays were placed into the custody of the U.S. Secret Service following the autopsy5 . They were later given to the President’s brother, Robert Kennedy, in 1965. Edward Reed, the junior ranking of the x-ray techs, testified that he alone took the skull x-rays, and that he took a lateral and then an AP (anterior to posterior) x-ray of the skull6 , and that only two skull x-rays were taken during the autopsy. Jerrol F. Custer testified that he took a total of 5 skull x-rays (AP, two laterals, and two oblique films)7 . Dr. Ebersole stated that there were 5 or 6 skull x-rays taken during the autopsy8 . The reason for the discrepancy between the number of skull x-rays taken versus the number transferred with the collection is not known. The conclusion of the Warren Report was that a single bullet struck the skull, with entrance over the right lower occipital region, adjacent to the external occipital protuberance, and it exited in the region of the stephanion on the right side9 . The first professional interpretation of the skull x-rays was provided by Russell H. Morgan, M.D., for the Clark Panel10, which was appointed by Attorney General Ramsey Clark in response to criticism of the autopsy report. The Clark Panel inventory lists one AP skull x-ray and two left lateral skull x -rays.

Morgan, M.D., for the Clark Panel10, which was appointed by Attorney General Ramsey Clark in response to criticism of the autopsy report. The Clark Panel inventory lists one AP skull x-ray and two left lateral skull x -rays. Dr. Morgan interpreted the x-rays as showing an entrance wound approximately 100 mm above the external occipital protuberance, and 25 mm to the right of midline. He identified a 6.5mm metallic object visible on the AP x -ray, and he thought that this same object was visible on the right lateral x-ray, embedded in the outer table of the skull, adjacent to the entry. He postulated that the bullet fragmented and produced a large bony defect of the right frontal and parietal skull, with the defect extending approximately 25mm across the midline to involve the left parietal skull. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) performed computer enhancement of the skull x-rays at the Aerospace Corporation in California in 1978, with the assistance of Gerald M. McDonnel, M.D., radiologist11. Dr. McDonnel concurred with the Clark Panel report that there was evidence of a single entry wound which he placed 96mm above the external occipital protuberance. He agreed with Dr. Morgan regarding the 6.5 mm metallic object visible on the AP film. David O. Davis, M.D. reviewed the films for the HSCA and he also described the entry as located in the parietal bone, 90 to 100mm above the external occipital protuberance. He was not able to positively identify the 6.5mm metallic object on the lateral films12. He disagreed that this same 6.5mm object, proposed to be a cross-section of the bullet that struck the skull, could be seen on the lateral x-rays. To obtain approval to view the original autopsy x-rays and photographs, one must request permission from the attorney who represents the Kennedy family for the materials covered by the Deed of Gift. When I first heard of the Deed of Gift, I assumed that these materials were in fact a gift to the Archives. My assumption could not have been further from the truth. In 1965 the Justice Department, under Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, drafted House Resolution 9545, which required the transfer of the autopsy material and other assassination related materials to the National Archives. This bill was approved by Congress and became public bill 89-318. Robert Kennedy was “not sympathetic” to requests to turn the autopsy materials over to the Archives13. He was not allowed to keep this material privately, and he eventually had to turn over all of the autopsy materials in his possession.

He was not allowed to keep this material privately, and he eventually had to turn over all of the autopsy materials in his possession. I am not privy to the relationship between the Deed of Gift attorney and the Kennedy family, or between same attorney and the Archives personnel. I certainly don’t blame the Kennedy family for these restrictions. But I do know that when these x-rays and photographs were placed into the Archives, and then access was restricted according to the Deed of Gift, the net effect was to severely restrict access. In addition, by placing them under the Deed of Gift, they are deemed private materials, and are not subject to Freedom of Information laws. To view this material one must first have the professional qualifications outlined in the Deed of Gift, and then demonstrate a specific reason for viewing the material. Very few people are even aware that the x-rays and photographs might be viewed, and then, the topic of the assassination remains so politically charged that very few physicians want to get involved. As a result, I was told by Archives personnel that there are many years in which the original films are not taken out of cold storage. I requested to view the original skull x-rays and was approved, based upon my qualifications as a neurologist with an interest in the assassination. Actually, my first request was to view all of the x-rays and photographs, and the request was denied. I then narrowed my request to view only the skull x-rays, and Senator Kirk stated that I must have a specific reason for viewing them. I listed the primary goals of the viewing as repeating the optical density measurements of the x-rays, which had previously been done by Dr. David Mantik, and to measure the sella turcica, the bony “cave” which houses the pituitary gland. The sella turcica appeared to be enlarged on the images which were placed in the HSCA report. I was then approved to view the original skull x-rays only. I spent one morning in April of 2015 viewing the x-rays and working with the Archives staff to take measurements of the film with an optical densitometer, to compare with the previous measurements made by Dr. Mantik. The optical densitometer has been used for quality control of x-ray film, and Dr. Mantik, with his background in physics and radiation oncology, came up with the idea to use the densitometer to compare the relative density of different areas of the autopsy x-rays.

The person viewing the x-rays at the Archives is never allowed to touch the actual film, and the x-rays are enclosed in a thin, perfectly clear mylar covering. The Archives personnel handle the film at all times, and there was a minimum of two people, and usually three, looking over my shoulder while viewing the films. In addition to dictating my findings, I was allowed to take notes and draw with pencil and paper supplied by the Archives. No photographs may be taken of these x-rays or of the autopsy photographs. This may be redundant, but in this review, I will be reviewing the appearance of the x-ray film at the Archives, referred to as the original x-rays, and then the images of these x-rays which were placed into the HSCA report. And I will also review the HSCA computer-enhanced x-ray film which is stored at the Archives, and the images of these x-rays which were placed into the HSCA report. Anyone may order copies of the images placed into the HSCA report. These images however are of poor quality and there are some very important differences between these images and the x-rays stored at the Archives. After spending the morning taking measurements of the films, we took a brief lunch break. After the break I began to view the x-rays again, and this time I dictated my findings into a microcassette recorder, since my handwriting is slow, and I must admit, very sloppy. After several minutes of dictating, one of the three Archives employees who were standing nearby and supervising my visit left the room and returned with the director of the Special Access section at the Archives, Martha Murphy. I had the impression that Ms. Murphy was upset, and she informed me that I had not been viewing the original x-rays, but had instead been viewing the computer-enhanced films which had been produced for the HSCA in 1977. I then asked if I could see the original x-rays, since I was approved to view them, and these were brought out for viewing. To this day I don’t know exactly why this happened, but it allowed me to compare the HSCA films with the images of these same films which were placed into the HSCA report, and they are not the same. I don’t believe it was an accident that I was initially shown the HSCA films. Some of the Archives personnel have been working with these x-rays for decades.

I had the impression that Ms. Murphy was brought into the room in response to something that I dictated, but I am not sure exactly what prompted them to notify her. As it turned out, I am glad that this happened, since I would have never thought to ask for permission to view the HSCA x-rays, in addition to viewing the original x-rays. Figure 2 is the skull x-ray from 1960 which is stored at the Presidential Library near Boston. I initially thought that this was stored at the Archives, however they told me that it had been returned to the Library after it was viewed for the HSCA in 1977. When I contacted the Library, they stated that it must not have been returned, because they didn’t have the film. After many conversations they looked again and it was found at the Library, where it was labeled as a sinus x-ray. I was allowed to view this x-ray and take optical density measurements, to compare with the autopsy x-rays. Figure 3 is the image of the original right lateral film, and figure 5 is the image of the original AP film. These images which were published with the HSCA report are of very poor quality, and very blurred, compared to the x-ray films. The right lateral image especially appears different and much more difficult to review, compared to the original. Figure 4 is my replication of the left lateral skull x-ray, which was made by flipping the right lateral image, and then cropping the posterior third of the image out of view. It is interesting to note that the Clark Panel recorded that there were two left lateral skull x-rays, rather than a left and a right lateral film. Figures 6 and 7 are the images of the HSCA films which were placed into the HSCA report. The computer enhancement resulted in brightening of the dark areas of the skull, and darkening some of the bright areas, so that there is a more uniform brightness. This wasn’t strictly a matter of brightening or darkening certain areas of the film, however. Some important details were left out of the enhanced images, and this was not inadvertent, as will be explained. he anterior portion of the skull appears very dark on the lateral images, and the posterior half appears too bright.

Because of this, it is very difficult to determine the areas of bone loss, especially over the anterior half. In any skull x-ray, the area of the temporal and sphenoid bones is the thinnest part of the skull, and therefore this area will appear darker than other areas of the skull, however this area of darkness on the autopsy lateral x-rays extends into the frontal and parietal bones. If the films were overexposed (too much radiation) or overdeveloped (developing solution too concentrated, developing time too long, or developer temperature too high), then the entire skull would have appeared darker than expected. The actual skull x -rays at the Archives do not show as much contrast between the front and back as you see on these images, however the contrast is still very unusual, and this has been noted by all the professionals who have viewed these films over the years. This could have been accomplished during the copying process, and it would not have been difficult. I agree with Mantik that the most likely way in which these x-rays were altered was through the copying process, by controlling the amount of light passing through certain areas of the film. On the AP x-rays, and on the attached AP images from the HSCA report, there is an obvious loss of bone over the frontal and parietal regions. The right side of the frontal bone is heavily fractured, and the frontal sinus can be seen inside a large fragment which has separated from surrounding bone on the right side. What is not usually appreciated on the AP x -ray is the loss of occipital bone, first described by Mantik. I agree with him that the AP image shows an area of bone loss extending into the left occipital region, demonstrated by figure 8. This appearance on the AP x-ray can only be caused by loss of occipital bone. The right lateral film also reveals a subtle change to the occipital bone, but there is a significant drop in the optical density measurements on the right lateral film over the occipital bone, and the outline of the bone in this region is disrupted, compared with the President’s skull x-ray from 1960. Figure 8 also demonstrates an area on the AP x-ray which corresponds to the posterior temporal and parietal skull covered by the “white patch” on the lateral x-rays. This area, enclosed by a circle, includes several fragments, which are most likely bone fragments, but there could be metallic fragments", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:128:aabae3a6dda8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 805, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "optical density measurements on the right lateral film over the occipital bone, and the outline of the bone in this region is disrupted, compared with the President’s skull x-ray from 1960.

This area, enclosed by a circle, includes several fragments, which are most likely bone fragments, but there could be metallic fragments as well. I am convinced that the white patch was added to the lateral images to cover an area of bone loss and fragmentation. Another area of bone loss is visible on the lateral x-ray, a small area over the right temporal bone, shown in figure 9. This loss of bone is consistent with an entry or exit wound. It is located at the same location as a wound which James Jenkins saw during the autopsy, just above the right ear. I viewed the autopsy photos stored at the archives, and there was a round blood-filled hole visible in this same area, on the photograph showing the right side of the head. This same photograph was not included in the digital images produced by the ARRB, which I viewed in June 2017. My most important new finding is noted on figure 10, which is a rep-lication of a portion of the right lateral film as viewed at the Ara cluster of tiny metallic-appearing objects within the gap, extending into the skull. This cluster of small objects, consistent with tiny metallic fragments, lies at the apex of the fragment trail located in the superior portion of the skull. The fragment trail widens from front to back, and the largest fragments were located toward the back of the skull. In general, larger fragments travel farther than smaller fragments, since the energy of a moving object is related to both mass and speed. Multiple researchers have proposed an entry in this area of the forehead, which was covered by thick hair. Figure 11 demonstrates how the images were “enhanced” in this area, and the image which was placed in the HSCA report was altered to obscure both the gap between bone fragments and also the metallic fragments adjacent to the gap. If the image was only altered to increase the brightness of this area of the film, it would not have resulted in filling in of the gap in the bone, or the covering up of the fragments. This tells me that someone associated either with the enhancement process, or with the publication of these images, understood the importance of this finding, and did not want it to be widely known. I was especially interested in this area before I visited the Archives, because the cone of the fragment trail points toward this area of the skull. I scanned the films with a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:129:8566a2118790", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 806, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "filling in of the gap in the bone, or the covering up of the fragments.

I was especially interested in this area before I visited the Archives, because the cone of the fragment trail points toward this area of the skull. I scanned the films with a 2X magnifier, and then, was able to use a 10X loupe magnifier to focus on areas of interest. The tiny metallic fragments were visible without the loupe magnifier, and they were faintly visible without the 2X magnifier. I viewed the perimeter of the skull thoroughly and did not see any other area with a similar appearance. The location of the fragments on the inner edge of the skull, at the apex of the fragment trail at the top of the skull, indicates that this was an entry wound. When I saw these tiny fragments in this gap in the frontal bone, my first thought was – why hasn’t this been reported before? I don’t know the answer to this question. It might have been because I was very curious about this area on the x-rays before the visit, and it was one of the first areas that I viewed on the original films. Figures 12 and 13 demonstrate the fragment trail and the silhouette within the right orbit on the AP x-ray (since I think that this was added to the film), but it is represented by an outline. I did include metallic densities which are present within the larger burn mark, in the right temporal region on the AP image. The majority of the metallic fragments lie within the superior half of the skull, and most of these are situated within a cone which expands from front to back, with the apex of the cone directed toward a large fragment of the right frontal skull, which had collapsed backward and slightly downward into the skull. The original and the HSCA x-ray films revealed innumerable tiny metallic fragments in the anterior half of the skull. The images of both the original and the HSCA enhanced films placed into the HSCA report do not show most of these tiny fragments – they have been effectively removed from these images. The lateral films reveal that many of the tiniest fragments appear along a line extending from the right frontal skull toward the back of the skull. In one area these tiny fragments are layered along a thin, straight line, and it is possible that these tiny fragments were layered along the dura (leathery membrane surrounding the brain), which would have been sagging into the skull, due to skull fractures and absent bone. The most posterior fragment is located at the parietal-occipital junction", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:130:2a56a8ace814", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 807, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "films reveal that many of the tiniest fragments appear along a line extending from the right frontal skull toward the back of the skull.

The most posterior fragment is located at the parietal-occipital junction on the right lateral image (figure 12, horizontal arrow). I agree with Mantik that this fragment was visible within the large 6.5mm bright object which is the bright object on the AP film. McDonnel described this small fragment at the parietal-occipital as lying between the galea (thick fibrous layer of the scalp) and the outer table of the skull. Most of the fragments which are seen in the lower half of the skull on the AP image cannot be seen on the lateral image. The most likely explanation for this is that they are hidden by the white patch, an area which will be discussed later. If the HSCA medical panel had been correct, and a single bullet struck the skull in the posterior parietal region, why does the fragment trail expand from front to back? The smallest fragments on the x-ray are located at the opposite side of the skull from the HSCA entrance, which would defy the laws of physics. Another feature noted on the lateral x-ray, mentioned above, and first described by Dr. McDonnel, is the fragment which is embedded in the scalp in this location, and this would be difficult to explain. This fragment would have had to bounce backwards from the bone and lodge in the scalp which it had passed through, highly unlikely with a high velocity projectile. It would be impossible to explain the location of this fragment from a single entry wound at the Warren commission entry site – this would require the fragment to tunnel under the scalp at an angle greater than 90 degrees from its trajectory into the skull. W hen fractures intersect, the fracture which formed last will termiure 14). This was first described by Georg Puppe, a German physician, in 1903, and this rule is very helpful when interpreting x-rays showing multiple fractures. Figure 15 shows a fracture terminating when it encounters a long radial fracture. The long radial fracture is fully consistent with an entry radial fracture from the lower occipital region. The shorter fracture is consistent with a short radial fracture from an exit wound at the posterior parietal region (the HSCA entry site). Fractures associated with entry wounds are typically much longer than fractures associated with exit wounds. This image also shows another radial fracture ending when it encounters the white patch. This intersection of fractures argues against a single entry at the HSCA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:131:57384384e426", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 808, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "long radial fracture is fully consistent with an entry radial fracture from the lower occipital region.

Fractures associated with entry wounds are typically much longer than fractures associated with exit wounds. This image also shows another radial fracture ending when it encounters the white patch. This intersection of fractures argues against a single entry at the HSCA entry site, since the radial fracture which is associated with this area terminates when it intersects the long radial fracture. If there were a single entry wound at the HSCA site, this radial fracture would have occurred first, and it would not have ended when it encountered the second fracture. This was previously described by Dr. Randy Robertson, radiologist. The HSCA enhanced x-ray films, not the images placed in the HSCA report, but the actual film at the Archives, reveals yet another set of intersecting fractures, as shown in a replication in figure 16. The fractures are drawn in white to delineate them from the dark surrounding area. The configuration of these fractures suggests that the arc-shaped fracture is a concentric fracture, and the relatively straight fracture is a radial fracture, likely emanating from the right frontal entry. The large white object visible in the upper aspect of the right orbit lets supposedly fired by Lee Harvey Oswald, from a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle. I agree with Mantik that the appearance of this object on the original AP x -ray indicates that this is artificial. Attached is a drawing made by Mantik during one of his visits to the archives (figure 17) (my drawing is worse than my writing). There are densities within the outline of this fragment which appear to be fragments, and the largest of these fragments lines up on the lateral film with the fragment embedded in the scalp, the same object described as embedded in the scalp by McDonnel. The only thing that I can add to Dr. Mantik’s description is that I thought there was a gradual increase in the density of the lower portion of this object, from its lower margin toward the midportion of the object. There are too many problems with this object to mention them all. The Warren Commission noted that the nose and the tail of this bullet were found in the limousine, so that would leave this object coming from the mid portion of the bullet, and this defies explanation.

A fragment of this brightness on the AP x-ray should have stood out like a sore thumb on the lateral image. Dr. Mantik took more optical density measurements of this object than I did, and he has described how impossibly dense this would have to be, if it were real. When Dr. Mantik interviewed Dr. Ebersole by phone, the conversation abruptly ended when he asked Ebersole about this 6.5mm object. The most likely way in which this was added to the film was through copying, and it would have been easy for this to have been done. Dr. Ebersole, the radiologist attending the autopsy, made some comments in his HSCA testimony which may be relevant here14. He noted that the x-rays “showed no evidence of a slug, a bullet,” and that this was “disconcerting.” He told a strange story about communicating within the next few days with Dr. James Young at the White House by phone, to give measurements to help prepare a bust of the late President. He told of communicating with him cryptically, “something to the effect that Aunt Margaret’s skirts need the following change.” It must be asked why these measurements would be obtained from the fractured and deformed skull as shown on the x-rays, and why would there be a need to talk in such cryptic terms? Could this have had something to do with copying (and alteration) of the x-rays? Dr. Ebersole was certainly uncomfortable with the subject of the 6.5mm object. The white patch, as described by Mantik, is demonstrated on the neg-ative image of the HSCA lateral in Figure 15, and labeled “A.” This could have been easily added to a copy of the film, by covering these areas and reducing exposure to light, during the copying process. The white patch is actually two areas, separated by a fracture line. Another fracture abruptly ends when it encounters the lower part of the white patch, adding weight to the argument that this area is artificial. The optical density measurements of this area on the right lateral film placed the density of the skull in this area as almost the same density as the petrous ridge, at the base of the skull. The petrous ridge is almost solid bone across the base of the skull when viewed on the lateral projection.

The petrous ridge is almost solid bone across the base of the skull when viewed on the lateral projection. The optical density of the left lateral film placed the density of the white patch as more dense than the petrous ridge. Naked eye observation tells you that this area appears very strange, but the optical densitometer proves beyond doubt that this must be artificial. There are two burn marks on the AP film, and figure 18 is a replication of the AP film which corresponds on the anterior to posterior axis with a line which extends from the right temporal bone back through the white patch to the posterior parietal skull. (This is not apparent until you take into account the angle of the AP film – it was taken at an angle of 15 degrees below the normal angle of the AP x-ray. This angle is easily calculated by measuring the distance between the lower rim of the orbit and the top of the petrous ridge on the AP x-ray, and then applying this distance to the lateral film.) Burn marks on an x-ray could occur if the film was held over the “hot lamp” too long. The hot lamp is the term for a bright light which is housed in a metal frame, and it can be used for viewing areas which are too dark when viewed on the standard view box. In the days of viewing x-ray film, rather than digital images on a monitor, burn marks were rarely produced if the film were held over the bright light for too long. I’ve talked with multiple radiologists and neurologists who spent their careers viewing film, before digital images became available, and they all agreed that they were rare, and many had never seen a burn mark. They all agreed with me that a perfectly round burn mark would be extremely unusual. In addition, it would not be expected to create the metallic-appearing densities which are visible within the burn mark on the AP film. Dr. Ebersole testified to the HSCA that he “may have” made the burn marks, by holding the film too close to the hot lamp15. It is difficult to believe that he could not definitely remember making such burn marks, on the most important x-rays that he had ever viewed. Jerrol Custer stated in his ARRB testimony16 that “this is where Dr. Ebersole got it too close to the heat lamp.” He added “Isn’t it funny how where it starts to burn is the area that I suggested", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:134:f4b58e7c19b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 811, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 135, "text": "he “may have” made the burn marks, by holding the film too close to the hot lamp15.

The old hot lamps had a metal frame, with a large hole a few inches in diameter in the frame covering the bright bulb, and the film was placed over this hole to illuminate the area of concern. I speculate that the burn marks added to the copy film were caused by something other than a hot lamp, possibly with a cigarette lighter. In my opinion this area deserves further study. I’m very skeptical of the official story surrounding these burn marks. After viewing the x-rays in 2015, I requested permission to view them again, and the request was denied. I was approved, however, to return to the Archives and view the autopsy photographs of the head wounds, and these were viewed in September of 2015. Following that visit, I corresponded with Senator Kirk, and with Martha Murphy at the Archives, and several other researchers were corresponding with them as well, encouraging them to make high quality digital images of the x-rays. This would preserve these images and would also allow for better analysis of the images. In late 2016 I thought that some progress was being made, and Senator Kirk appeared to be in favor of digitizing the x-rays. Subsequently Martha Murphy called and relayed that this could not be done, however she said that they would try to retrieve digital images which were made by the ARRB, at the Kodak facility in Rochester in 1997. It turned out that the x-rays were not included in the digital images made at Rochester, but the digital images of the photographs were converted from their Jaz drive format to a usable format by the Archives personnel. I was then able to view these digital images of the photographs at the archives in early June of 2017. I again corresponded with Senator Kirk and with Ms. Murphy, recommending digitization of the x-rays, and our group of researchers offered to cover the cost of making these digital copies. As of this writing, after six months there has not yet been a response to this request.

As noted, I’ve viewed the autopsy photographic prints in 2015, and also the digital images of the photographs in 2017. The digital imbecause the viewer can magnify the images on the monitor and see much more detail. The prints may be viewed with a stereoscopic viewer and this gives the viewer a 3D image, which is especially helpful when viewing the photograph labeled the scalp retraction photo. Some of the autopsy photographs were not turned over to Robert Kennedy by the Secret Service, and copies were subsequently sold by James Fox, a Secret Service photographer, in the 1970’s. These “Fox” images are now widely seen on the internet. There were apparently no repercussions from the sale of these photographs, and this makes a mockery of the Deed of Gift and the sequestration of the original photographs. The Fox photographic images on the internet are of poor quality, and because of this the evidence of alteration of some of these photos is hidden. In the case of the scalp-retraction photographs, the Fox version is cropped and this causes difficulty in interpreting the image. There are three versions of the scalp-retraction photograph (also referred to as the mystery photo) at the Archives, numbered 1,2,44,45, 17JB, and 18JB, according to the Clark Panel report. I did not record the numbers of the prints when I viewed them at the archives, which I should have done in retrospect. There are two black and white versions, and onecolor version. One of the black and white versions appears to show the glare of a light shining across the image from the right side. The light casts shadows across the image, which appeared to be caused by small particles on the surface of the photograph. This photograph appeared to be a photograph of a photograph (figure 19). Why would there be a photograph of a photograph in this collection? The most likely explanation is that it would have served to replace one of the existing photographs, although if that were the case, it was performed sloppily and in haste. Obviously, I don’t know where or when this would have been done. I have not been able to obtain a copy of this image, and this image (figure 19) was made from a screenshot of a GIF, described with the text below the figure.

The image in the GIF is not exactly the same as the photo that I observed – in that part of the image the GIF appears as if it is covered by a glass cover and it appears to be partially magnified. The color version of the scalp-retraction photo was the most helpful to me when viewing at the Archives. In the left upper portion of the photo there is plainly seen a layer of retracted fat from the abdominal wall. The nipple on the right chest wall is barely visible. The V incision is seen on the right forehead, and the right eyebrow and lashes are visible. There is a wide fracture pointing toward the frontal region, and the curve of the right side of the skull and the posterior fossa is visible. One of the most telling things about the back of head photographs in the collection, is that you never see the full back of the head in any of them. The left occipital region is never fully seen on the same photo showing the right occipital region. Also, the whorl of hair is seen just to the right of the midline on these autopsy photos, however there are multiple photographs of President Kennedy during life which show that this whorl of hair was on the far left side of his scalp. The autopsy images of the back of the head show that someone is holding the scalp, and I believe, as do many researchers, that the scalp was mobilized and stretched to cover the back of the head for some of these photos. The lower area of the back of the head on these photographs appeared very strange, and it almost defies description. This was even more apparent on the digital images, but it was also seen on the prints. The hair in this area appeared to be much too fine to be real, and in the background, there appeared to be a phantom image which was darker, suggesting that this part of the photograph was added as a layer over this region. The print of the photograph which was taken from the right side of the autopsy table shows the right side of the head, with the bone flap visible above and slightly behind the right ear. A small blood-filled hole is visible on the print, just anterior to the bone flap. James Jenkins saw what he thought was a bullet wound in this location during the autopsy.

To my disappointment, this particular photograph was not included in the set of digital photos which I was allowed to view at the Archives. James Jenkins has not been allowed to view the autopsy photographs at the Archives, and I and others have written to support his request. Included in the collection of digital photographs prepared for the ARRB were three photographs which were recovered from a roll of film taken by Floyd Riebe, Navy photographer, on the night of the autopsy17. This roll of film was taken from Riebe and exposed to light by Roy Kellerman of the Secret Service. Two of these three images show the right side of the head, from slightly different angles. Although the images are somewhat dark, the only area of these images which appeared to be blurred was over the back of the right side of the head, and the left side of the head was not seen. The area behind the ear appeared to be smudged. The facial features were clearly seen, and the gallery rails were visible in the background, on the left side of the autopsy table. These photos were labeled A1-01, A1-02, B4-01 and B4-02. The photographs of the brain were viewed only on the prints, as they were not included in the digital images. I have no doubt that these photos could not be photos of President Kennedy’s brain. Figure 20 is a drawing of the dorsum of the brain from the HSCA report, figure F-302. The photograph of the dorsum of the brain at the Archives showed swelling of the left hemisphere, and subarachnoid blood was present. The left hemisphere shows no evidence of laceration on this dorsal view. The brain was somewhat deformed or twisted, and the Ida Dox drawing of this photograph doesn’t portray this. There was no hemorrhage visible in the wideopen wound of the right hemisphere. The ventral (undersurface) of the brain showed that the cerebellum was completely intact, except for a small sliver of folia hanging loose on the left side, which can occur with handling of this delicate tissue. There was a faint linear laceration extending along the lateral surface of the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe on the left side, barely extending into the brain substance. This appeared to be a saw-cut laceration, which I have seen on many occasions, during my time as a morgue assistant in medical school, and later during brain cutting sessions when I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:138:e3b1be96ab31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 815, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "small sliver of folia hanging loose on the left side, which can occur with handling of this delicate tissue.

I believe that one of the reasons that the Clark Panel and the HSCA medical panel moved the entry location was because they knew that an entry in the right lower occipital region would have caused a massive amount of damage to the cerebellum. There was no way to reconcile the brain photographs with the Warren Commission entry location. Not only that, but there are no fragments extending from the Warren Commission entry site and the proposed exit site at the top of the skull. They moved the entry site to a location 100mm above the WC entry, however this site is disproved as an entry site by the x -ray evidence of intersecting fractures. They saw an area on the back of head photographs which they determined must be an entry wound, however this area appeared to me to be a superficial scrape or abrasion. The fragment trail cone expands from front to back, while it should have expanded from back to front, if the HSCA entry location were correct. Another reason that the HSCA medical panel moved the entry location must be because of its own trajectory analysis. If a shot fired from the TSBD 6^(th) floor entered at the right lower occiput, it would have blown out the front of the face, rather than exiting at the top of the skull. This trajectory analysis was subsequently buried in the HSCA data. Dr. J. Thornton Boswell, one of the Navy pathologists at the autopsy, drew a diagram showing the width of the large defect of the skull, and he also noted that the falx was torn from the “coronal suture back”18. The falx is a tough fibrous membrane which separates the upper portion of the hemispheres of the brain. It would be impossible for there to be such a loss of bone and also a laceration of the falx over this large area, without having a speck of injury to the left hemisphere of the brain. By the time of the President’s autopsy, James Jenkins had considerable experience in assisting the pathologists with removal of the brain at autopsy, and his remarks should carry weight. He described Dr. Humes as saying that the brain literally fell out of the skull into his hands, and he did not see Dr. Humes make the usual cuts", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242127_cleaned.txt:139:aabebd0b50e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 816, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242127_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242127", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242127_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "a laceration of the falx over this large area, without having a speck of injury to the left hemisphere of the brain.

He described Dr. Humes as saying that the brain literally fell out of the skull into his hands, and he did not see Dr. Humes make the usual cuts of the dura and vessels needed to remove the brain from the skull. This brings up multiple issues which I won’t go into here, but are better explored by reading David Lifton, Doug Horne, William Law, and others. This involves the shell game involving the two separate teams who thought they were bringing the casket bearing the President into the morgue at Bethesda, the two separate brain examinations, and other issues. There was deception involved in the autopsy, and I don’t pretend to be an expert on all of the evidence of deception, but I agree that it was done to hide the true nature of the wounds. upon the pattern of intersecting fractures, loss of bone, and the fragment trail. If there were only two shots impacting the skull, then the right lower occipital entry occurred first, followed by the right frontal entry. The bullet which struck the right forehead fragmented into innumerable tiny fragments, while the bullet which struck the right lower occiput was likely jacketed and there was little fragmentation. There is x-ray evidence of a small bony defect in the right temporal bone, in an area in which James Jenkins saw a round wound with gray margins. I saw this on the autopsy photograph of the right side of the head. If this were an entry wound, then that implies 3 shots striking the skull. David Mantik and Doug Horne have described their 3-shot scenario and I haven’t seen any evidence to refute their ideas. I’m not ready to totally agree yet, since I think it is still possible that the right temporal wound could have been an exit wound from the right lower occipital entry. Such a shot would have more likely come from a lower floor of the DalTex building, with a direct line of sight. When considering a multiple shooter scenario, I recommend reading Carol Hewett’s essay, and her discussion of the use of silencers and sound suppressors19. I will be the first to admit that David Mantik and Doug Horne understand the totality of the evidence much better than I do, and I strongly recommend reading their 3-shot scenario20.

In my opinion, it is much more likely that they were coerced in some way to follow the official story coming out of Dallas, that there was a single shooter, from the rear. They could have been told that they must support this theory, in the interest of national security. In his depositions, Dr. Humes seems to be talking around many subjects, and he was less than forthcoming in his testimonies. In the case of the enhancement of the x-rays for the HSCA, I am more skeptical. The changes made to the enhanced x-rays were done in a way which obscured important information. And then, the images of the original and enhanced films were altered when they were placed into the HSCA report, and I strongly believe that this was a deliberate attempt to hide evidence. I requested any records pertaining to the enhancement of the x-rays, and I was informed that the Archives has no records pertaining to this process. Personally, this has been a humbling experience. Before going to the Archives, I didn’t really grasp the importance of the medical evidence, and I didn’t know what I was getting into. It is humbling to look at the x-rays and the photographs, and to see the massive amount of injury inflicted upon President Kennedy. It looked bad enough on the HSCA films, and when I was told that I had not been looking at the originals, I found myself breathing a sigh of relief, even hoping that the evidence wouldn’t look so bad on the original films. But then they brought out the original films, and it just looked worse. I cannot imagine how it felt to be part of what James Jenkins experienced. It makes me appreciate his honesty and his courage even more. I must admit to a certain ambivalence about telling of my findings from reviewing the autopsy photographs and x-rays at the Archives. There are times when I wonder if I’m doing the right thing, by describing the evidence, and how it was manipulated and deceptively presented by the Warren Commission report and by the House Select Committee report. I still love my country, and in this day of turmoil in Washington, I don’t want to weaken our institutions further.

I was always impressed with their honesty and integrity – how a person faces personal illness says a lot about them. I don’t think that we can hold the current employees of agencies of the government responsible for what happened over 50 years ago, even though we know that some of these agencies are still working to hide the evidence. In my opinion, these agencies have changed, compared to the early 60’s when they were treated like a personal fiefdom by men such as Allen Dulles, James Angleton, and J. Edgar Hoover. Some changes were made as a result of the Church Committee; however, the country has never really faced up to the extent of the abuses of the 60’s. So, I believe that it is not incongruent to support their work today, while strongly supporting a search for the truth surrounding the assassination. Eventually I decided that anyone who has seen the primary evidence has a responsibility to speak the truth, and that we need to learn why this tragic event happened, and only then can we safeguard the country from having something like it happening again. [] Figure 4: Approximate replication of the left lateral x-ray, demonstrating how the posterior aspect of the skull was not seen on this film. The right lateral skull image was flipped and cropped to prepare this replication. Jerrol Custer stated that the cutoff left lateral film was caused by his inability to position the GE 250 portable x-ray unit between the autopsy table and the gallery21. The adjacent diagram is a drawing of the morgue which was made by Paul O’Connor, Navy corpsman. There is an obvious problem with Custer’s explanation – for a left lateral x-ray, the film is placed on the left side of the body, and the portable x-ray unit is placed on the right side of the body. There should have been no problem taking the left lateral skull x-ray.

And if metaphor and mythology are ephemeral, like archetype, how could an empirically scientific or even an academic analysis be made about them? And what if Oregon’s voice was Poetic in nature? Like the romance languages? And, what if Oregon’s voice was not only bi-cultural, but also a crazy Pioneer-stock voice? Not to mention brutally honest? The Nez Perce elder women adapted me because I spoke their language from the heart, a heart which knew their songs, in Nez Perce. But the Pioneer stock part of me felt I needed a 12-step program to recover from being a 6th generation Oregon girl. Without knowing why, I was always taking crazy risks. I was motivated by what would be best for my community at my own financial peril. My Dad was the same way. Community survival was encoded. And honesty and collaboration was key to survival. I was always shocked other people didn’t think this way. When the covered wagons entered Oregon, suffering from dysentery, scurvy, hunger and exhaustion, the Indian people fed them. They had gardens of foods they didn’t even eat, for sale or trade, at the crossroads. Their compassionate and collaborative way of surviving is what helped my greatgreat grand-parents survive. And that communal ethic was carried into the missions. And from the missions carried into the towns. That is what solved the “What is Our Voice?” dilemma for me. I was luckily raised on Pioneer stock stories. My Grandmother, who was heir to our 1870 family farm, said that she always felt she was “a trespasser on Indian Land” and grateful that they shared this land. She had “nothing but respect for them.” My uncle said the Indian people were friends of our Pioneer Ancestor, Isaac Newton Edwards, and told him where the best place to put a house was, so that it wouldn’t be washed away by the Willamette River in the winter. They buried a child together under a White Oak tree. They shared medicines, clothing and food. They shared the land, without feeling they really had to own it. They lost children and families and risked everything to come here. And just look at these Oregon literary antiheroes: Randle Patrick Mc-Murphy, Henry and Hank Stamper, Johnson Monday, Webster T. Web (Webb), Elbridge Trask, and Ben Thaler; not to mention the Oregon writers themselves: Rick Steber, William Kittredge, David Duncan, Barry Lopez and Opal Whitely. All heroic to me.

Authors Alvin Josephy and Don Berry told those stories best. Josephy wrote 500 Nations and recounts in The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest what happened when young hotheaded white men trampled these gardens (that had fed them when they were children first arriving here). It was more than the young hotheaded Indian braves could take. I think it’s really what started the Nez Perce war. As for being Poetic? Well, there are a lot of names for Poetic Cinema. In France, it was “Nouveau Vague.” In Germany, it was “New Wave.” In Czechoslovakia, it was the miracle artist “the Cinema of Resistance” or “Subterfuge”; in America, it was “Experimental” then American filmmakers became so influenced by all of the above they started calling it “The New Hollywood.” I call it Poetic Cinema, because some great filmmakers from New York and other places, including Oregon, are not “the New Hollywood Filmmakers.” I was blessed to be a part of a Cinema Art house in Eugene that celebrated all of these and more, including Akira Kurasawa and Satyajit Ray. Jack Nicholson was our biggest fan, because Jack was a Poetic Cinema filmmaker and loved Oregon. Even in his early days with Roger Corman, he was trying to take films “to another level.” A quote from twenty-nine-year-old beatnik Method actor Dennis Hopper in 1965: “What we need are good old American – and that’s not to be confused with European – Art Films. The whole damn country’s one big real place to utilize and film, and God’s a great gaffer!” from: One Big Real Place: BBS From Head to Hearts by J. Hoberman https://www.criterion. com/current/posts/1671-one-big-real-place-bbs-from-head-to-hearts Even before that Jack wanted to create a movie studio and started optioning Oregon Literary properties, including a try at One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest; (’62) but Kirk Douglas had beat him to it when it was just in galley form. He did however, at the age of 25, buy the film rights to Don Berry’s Moontrap, (’62) while Dennis Hopper bought the rights to Don Berry’s Trask. (’60) What were these guys after? Jack Nicholson’s choice of Moontrap says it all to me. Moontrap is probably my favorite book ever, because it was a historical fiction novel about the very first American Pioneers in Oregon, fur traders who lived in peace with the Indians and adapted some of their ways.

An Oregon bi-cultural novel written as poetically as an existential western. Gus Van Sant’s Even Cowgirls Get The Blues (among others of his works) is revealed in a lot of ways to be existential, also called a New Western Film. The incredible production design and even the costuming in his film is Western Wear with a psychedelic twist: Sissy wears a fringed leather jumpsuit with a stripped surfer shirt T-shirt underneath just like the Merry Pranksters always wore (George Walker still wears them) but with counter-pane Whooping Cranes on them, which, in the film, she devises to dose with Peyote during their mating season. This is a New Western via Literary Critic Leslie Fiedler. See Chapter 6 for Fiedler’s theory about psychedelics and the New Western. And what was it about Rick Steber’s writing that caused the Oregonian newspaper writer Jonathan Nicholas to call him “the Faulkner of the Northwest?” Let’s start with a quote from Rick when we were discussing this voice using landscape as a character: “We carve on the Landscape and the Landscape carves on us.” His writing is very landscape driven, and cinematic, like Kesey’s and Berry’s. Rick has had many motion picture options paid on his books: Paul Newman for From New York to Nome; Disney for No End In Sight; and the longest in history: my 26-year option for a story of his in Rendezvous about Chief Joseph’s nephew Jackson Sundown for Blanket of the Sun. For the 30-some years I knew him, Ken Kesey spoke in metaphors. Intellectually he was brilliant and complex. Socially he was fun and loving. His wrestler persona never left him, however; he was physically lithe for a writer. He could use that physicality to be distant emotionally. A small hunch of the shoulders and triceps made me feel he was just itching to wrestle someone to the ground if they got too close or said the wrong thing. So, when I first arrived in his presence I would just grab him and give him a quick hug to break through any kind of barrier he seemed to have up. I would give anything to hug him again. Or to go back to the great days in the barn with his Parrot and others having great conversations while sitting or standing where the Zodiac was painted on the floor. And when he was happy he would tell us stories.

And when he was happy he would tell us stories. One of the first ones I heard was a story about coming back from the Pendleton Round-Up with his Dad, and seeing a 7-foot tall Indian protesting the damming of Celilo Falls on the Columbia River in 1957. He talked about how that damming caused a world full of irreparable hurt to the Indian People. What was done to them was enough to make them go insane. That Indian eventually became Cuckoo’s Nest. He said that “Without the Indian, Cuckoo’s Nest would have been a melodrama.” It was about two turn-of-the-century cowboys, one Black and the other Nez Perce Indian. The Pendleton Round-Up is a Rendezvous Place for some Indian people, like my best friend Etta, who was related to Chief Joseph through his brother Chief Ollicott, the war chief. It was Chief Ollicot’s brilliant defensive war maneuvers that WestPoint taught for a while. As a child Etta would ride in the baskets on pulleys hanging over Celilo Falls to get the caught fish from the other side for the processor. I wish he could have met her, because Kesey loved the zeitgeist of the Indian Culture of old, and with a top hat and magic wand would recite several stories Indian style. He said their Mythology was “Pure.” And “Truth.” It was a beautiful spring day in Mid-April 1983. Suddenly the skies turned dark and a huge west wind came up while Babbs read the poem, as only a Poet could read it. By the end of the poem we all knew what had just happened. They had conjured the wind, with the Poem. And then just as suddenly, the skies turned blue again, when it was over. He also tried to create a 3-part Opera with the Kwakiutl Indian tribe and the Grateful Dead based on Indian mythology. My friend Bob Zagorin interviewed Kesey and their tribal leader regarding this. The leader respected Ken for making the Giant Indian in Cuckoo’s Nest a real person with real problems (as opposed to the Noble Savage stereotype).1 Spirit is the je ne c’est quois that both Poetic Cinema & Oregon’s Cinematic Literary Voice has. Kesey was always demanding from us true authenticity.

Just watch the documentary and film called Sunshine Daydream, shot in Veneta, Oregon in 1972, and then tell me that this is not one of the most Oregon films you ever saw. Right up there with A River Between Us, Meek’s Cutoff and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. And, yes, even Sometimes a Great Notion. It’s called Rough Magic, starring a very young Russell Crow and Bridget Fonda. And it’s directed by Bernardo Bertolucci’s wife, Clare Peploe. I have watched it 50 times, and each time I find something new, deeper or more metaphoric or synchronistic, and more magical in it. It is also psychedelic, as Leslie Fiedler describes being essential to the New Western. And what about Pioneer Oregon filmmakers? They were the most helpful, friendly, open-minded, artistic, individualistic and collaborative people I have ever met. And lucky for me they taught me the only job I could ever do. We are tribal, too. I like to say we are just Nomadic Carnies following the work around, throwing up our tents. When he was a young teenager, he found an old movie camera from the 40’s that was used for news reels. It could shoot 100 feet of film. Later he bought a Bell & Howell. Then in 1963 he got on a bus in San Francisco, rented by future Academy Award filmmaker Haskell Wexler, with his documentary film crew, an inter-racial married couple and their kids, among others; all bound for “The March on Washington.” He said that the film crew became “invisible” after a while, and just kept on filming. After he got back, he bought a Bolex and made 4 or 5 experimental films. At the last minute, he threw them in his luggage for a trip to Europe in 1968, and by happenstance met a distributor in London, who started showing his films. He talked about how the crowds in Munich would talk back to the movies. They loved his political films, but would stand up, wave their arms and otherwise create diversions from his beautiful poetic films. My favorite is this one, Tamanawis Illahee (1983) that I helped screen for Anne Richardson and her husband Dennis Nyback in 2013 in Portland with Ron and his wife, Mary Lou.

It bombed. Why? Was it because, at the time, as I once read, it was the largest independent film ever produced without a studio? Just a negative pick-up deal with Universal for distribution. Did it go way over budget and therefore not have the P& A money to distribute it? Why did it open in just 22 theaters? Was it because by a freak happenstance on the Oregon coast that summer the Oregon rain was missing as a major landscape character in the film? Not to mention the Terrance Malik kind of meditation on Blackberry bushes? For me, it was Indian Jenny that was missing. And her backstory.

Let’s continue to unpack this film. First of all, the time was 1960 Oregon, the place was the great north woods of the scenic Oregon Coast, west of the Oregon Coast Range, as close as you can get to the very edge of the Old Frontier without swimming. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Moontrap and Trask are set in the same “Land’s End” of the Frontier, a land of rivers. And Wakonda is an old Indian word for a Great Spirit, who keeps the balance in the world, but “without gender and partial to certain shamans.” And balance is the fulcrum of where two opposites and/or two edges meet, dark and light, wilderness and clear-cut, the wild and civilization, good and evil, and where man vs nature. I propose that the Stamper Family are similar to the American Indian who won’t give up their ways of freedom and culture to be assimilated into civilization. There are bi-cultural influences here. Jenny was the key to this in the book. She won’t assimilate on the reservation. She whores for subsistence. But meanwhile, she is her own person. In the Indian cultures I know, the women decide who they want to sleep with. They decide if the marriage is working or not. They have the power. The townspeople wear muted colors, but mostly dark ones. The production uses the vibrant McCullouch chainsaw school-bus yellow pervasively. A primary color. And just like Edith did with the actors’ clothes, the Production designer dressed the Stamper Clan’s crummy in school-bus yellow too, while their personal cars are light colored vehicles while the towns people wore and drove dark ones. But this American Cowboy, whose horse is now classic cars, or a motorcycle, and was how he saved Viv, the damsel in despair in Colorado, and rode her home on the back of his mount to his castle. (The Stamper home even has a Turret on it.) Where his other steed is a speed boat, that he uses to round up his stray logs and rides them all to market. But the Siletz river that runs through it even separates the Stamper clan, who live on an Island of the river.

But the Siletz river that runs through it even separates the Stamper clan, who live on an Island of the river. This song is sung by another black man, Charley Pride; whose lyrics seem to be talking about us Oregon Pagans right out of the Declaration of Independence: “…the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them…” There is even a Johnny Cash song about Oregon timber in it, under scenes out in the woods involving logging, while inside the house, civilization reigned and Viv listens to classical with Lee. Suddenly then, a guitar screeches rock and blues as we return to the woods, where the pace is sped up to meet the contract’s deadline. I think that water is part of the objective correlative’s edge, the bound motif, a force of nature that is the edge of the frontier in the movie, where the house is separated from civilization, where the rafts of logs float to market, where Joe Ben drowns, where the football game on the sand turns into one with an almost murderous rage by drowning of the fighters, and the same high tide that drowned Joe Ben is the very same one that helps the Stamper family succeed in the end, when their logging equipment is destroyed, and they have to cut on the water’s edge for the rising tide to float the logs to market. I know Kesey said that everything in his novel had to have something to do with Henry’s “arm.” The fact that Henry has his left arm in a cast for the first half of the movie portends this diminishment of his manhood. The scene after he has taken it off shows him gleefully flapping his arms like a bird, a joyful expression of freedom and wholeness. But the other arm that is soon severed in the accident results in killing him, and it ends up in the freezer, where it becomes like a Knight in Shining Armor’s Coat of Arms on the mast of the tug boat as if to say, “Fuck You” to all the townspeople. I say this “fuck you” is for all of us, who sell out our word, our integrity and our rugged individualism. The American Cowboy loner syndrome is represented here, and the separation from the townspeople is also shown in the dark shirts and clothes they wear, like a black hat.

Even Leland wears darker colors at first, depicting his semi-torn allegiance with the townspeople. His costume then shows allegiance with “Hippies” with his long hair, Khaki jacket and Moccasins. The American Indian culture had a huge impact on this counter-culture group. The Stampers costumes are vibrant colors, pastel, or washed out pale blue denim, or downright white. By the end of the film, Leland has shifted to a lighter denim, too. It’s important to note, the Union reps are in a neutral color, beige. To underscore the sense that the Union is not to blame, even though Paul Newman cuts the Union Office desk in half with his chainsaw. It is the striking workers who want more pay for less work who first appear in black rain gear. And even the characters change colors as they change their political stance, from beige to dark in the case of the theater owner, and from pastels to dark in Viv’s case as she makes a stand against the Stampers. Her stand is not heeded, so surrendering, she leaves, this time in neutral white and beige. Richard A Colla was hired to direct, but left due to creative artistic differences, and Paul Newman took over directing. As in the case of Cuckoo’s Nest; this begs the question of filmmakers taking the book’s dark and dankness of the landscape and the hospital literally. Instead, the Mise en Scene is being reinterpreted by the filmmakers, like Milos did in using artistic license to read into the film a deeper level of metaphor with the bright “clinical” interiors of the hospital, and Paul Newman did with the sunny exteriors, and pastel colors of his protagonist. I have never met a logger who ever wore white to work. Like the protagonist in Five Easy Pieces, the hero is essentially a loner fighting for freedom and rugged individualism, against vapid intellectualism, and his freedom from all social contracts, including marriage. These are the men who settled Oregon, who, in this film are on the very precipice of the frontier, and have pushed back like the tide civilization and its compromises. And in the process, like the river’s edge at the tide, have turned back against themselves, reconciled to be men who have followed the rivers ever westward, to the edge of the frontier, and have had no choice but to have assimilated the larger consciousness of the vast Ocean into themselves like a mascaret or ortidal bore.

(Like Leland: long-haired, caring , cultured intellectual) The Stamper brothers in the novel are each one of the ways I am. V v However, I am a storyteller, and a round thinker in a square world. So, I would say that the beginning of Oregon Film also had a back-story that I would like to include. And I would say that it began in 1960 with a legislator named Richard Eymann, who we think went to Hollywood at the request of Oregon Governor Mark Hatfield, (1959- 1967) who had heard about MGM making a movie about Oregon’s Chief Joseph – in Washington state. The Story of Chief Joseph was going to be filmed in the State of Washington. Governor Mark O. Hatfield protested that it would be “almost sacrilegious” to film the story anywhere but Oregon and suggested that producers consult with actor Walter Brennan, who had a large working ranch in Joseph. The MGM film was nev- Richard Eymann was a new legislator from Springfield, Oregon,and very passionate about bringing the Hollywood film business to Oregon. Mike Dilley, who worked on The Way West in 1966, said he met Richard then, who kept a scrapbook of his Hollywood forays. At the time, the unofficial promoters of filming in Oregon were businessmen, who paid for their trips to LA out of their own pockets.2 In 1966, when the calls started coming into Governor Hatfield’s office for The Way West, Oregon had a PUC Permit/ Bonding process for any large semi-trucks coming into the state; but it didn’t make sense for filmmakers because it was such a lengthy process for the short period of time it was needed. Not to mention the BOND. We believe that is why the production chose to ship everything by rail: wagons, horses, props, building materials, etc. for the three months of pre-production. But that was not going to fly when it was time for filming, however; and the honey-wagons, make-up and hair trailers and generator semis needed to arrive by, well, by Semi. Someone had to have saved the day. As a teenager who once campaigned for Governor Hatfield, I am sure it was him. “Dick Eymann was a friend of my Grandmother’s; and one day in 1967, she told me he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:9:4ece98d91aab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 829, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "props, building materials, etc. for the three months of pre-production.

To gild our chances, I found Dick (Eymann) and told him who my grandmother was.” So, they ended up getting hired and spent the summer on Green Island, which was on the Willamette River by Coburg, Oregon. The production built its own town there. Mike Dilley, founder of the Eugene International Film Festival, also said that the big stars, Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark, Sally Field and Robert Mitchum all stayed at The Eugene Hotel. Joel Douglas, Kirk’s son, rented a house by Harlow Road. Mike himself was discovered by the Producer Harold Hecht, at Tino’s Italian Restaurant, while performing there in a folk music trio called The Grenadiers. The Grenadiers were: Jim Dotson, John Dotson and Mike Dilley. Mike was Harold’s hire and was treated with carte blanche by the crew. Mike remained friends with Kirk Douglas, and Robert and John, the Mitchum Brothers, for many years. He saw what my Grandfather saw, Hollywood on-location in Oregon was a way to drop millions of dollars into the economy, by employing hundreds of out-of-work artists and extras, buying everything in the Yellow Pages, and were environmentally friendly and didn’t cost the state any new roads, schools or other infrastructure that the other industries required for their labor force. The summer before Paint Your Wagon (1967) my family had moved to Eugene, (the land of my Mother’s people) partly because Klamath Falls, where I was born, had its 6^(th) year in a row as the “Murder Capitol” of the U. S. I was 16 years old at the time, and enrolled in South Eugene High School as a junior, where I also met my husband, Philip Krysl, in art class. I was one of those kids. But I wasn’t the only one. Ed was known for helping many of us believe we had what it took: Actor David Norfleet (who was in Cinderella Liberty with me) Producer Charlie Milhaupt, (Soldiers Story, Agnes of God) Actress Julia Anne Robinson, (Drive He Said, King of Marvin Gardens) Actress Julie Payne, Make-Up Artist Jose Arguiles, Oscar Winner Screenplay Writer E.

Max Frye (Something Wild) among others. Tony Farque has a lot of great memories from then. I met Tony 48 years ago through friends from South Eugene High School and the Dillard Road Commune. Tony said it was Charlie Milhaupt’s idea for them to hitch-hike to Baker, Oregon, (315 miles) the summer of 1968, and get jobs as extras on Paint Your Wagon. Charlie (who later helped me with my film career) was one of four guys at Sheldon High School that were the counter-part to Tony’s four guys @ South. My first husband, Jay Wilson, was one of them. The others were in a rock and roll band called “Hammond Typewriter” that used to live with us in a commune. They were all a part of a nightclub called “Billy Shears.” Tony had an elaborate light show for the venue. But Charlie was in a whole other world of his own. His sister, Marilee was probably partly responsible. She had dropped out of Reed College in 1964 and went to Haight Ashbury’s Red Dog Saloon, where she became involved with the PH Phactor Jug Band, who were involved with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, (who were involved with The Grateful Dead). There were a lot of Oregon connections back then. We don’t know if that ultimately included Marilee and Charlie, but we do know that it included Charlie Milhaupt’s sister, Gretchen, who was pregnant at the time. And we do know that Tony Farque and Dana Brockway from South Eugene stuck out their thumbs, and arrived just in time for a “cattle call for 300 extras” in the Baker Hotel. And 300 extras ready for work the next week. Everyone was given a number, and then a guy named Johnny Truscott, a 2-time Academy Award-winning Costume Designer, (Best Costume Design AND Best Art Direction–Set Decoration for Camelot) called Tony’s number and immediately started shouting numbers to his staff to write down. Evidently, they were hat, jacket, pants and shoe sizes for wardrobe. He did that for all 300 extras who were chosen. Some of Tony’s favorite memories are of Lee Marvin, whom he said was never drunk, was always the ultimate professional, who was also effusive, kind, and would give the extras his home phone number. One day, during a rather big and complicated shot with the whole cast and crew, Clint Eastwood flubbed his lines 4 times in a row. The rest of the shot was perfect, everyone else, including the extras, worked really hard to get it right for each take.

The rest of the shot was perfect, everyone else, including the extras, worked really hard to get it right for each take. Lee Marvin went up to Clint and grabbed him by the shirt collar and slapped him, hard. He told him to go to his trailer and not come back until he learned his lines. The whole film company was shocked, and a few were considering which one to bet on as the winner of an ensuing brawl. There was a lot of poker playing going on, around 25 games a day. Betting was the favorite past-time. Lee Marvin was an ex-Marine from the beach of Iwo-Jima, a war hero, but Clint was younger. They were both big men, at least 6’3.” Clint eventually dropped his fists and went to his trailer. When he came back, he knew his lines. Evidently Lee Marvin felt responsible for this show. He was a partner in the profits. There was never a problem again. The main actress, Jean Seberg, was an American actress beloved by the French. She was considered the ultimate actress of the French Nouvelle Vague. She had starred in Breathless, which had turned France’s version of the Hollywood Reporter, Cinema du Cahier, on its ear with its radical jump cuts. Francoise Truffaut had written the story and Jean-Luc Goddard directed it in The other women in the movie were odd, Tony said. There was an audition for an ethnic woman, the Preachers wife, and a beautiful American Indian woman named Redwing John, arrived for the part. She was a Klamath/Royal Cheyenne woman whom Tony later married. Everyone felt she was perfect. But as Hollywood was wont to do, they used a Chinese actress instead. But that was nothing compared to the French Tarts, who arrived en masse via Helicopters one day, (all the stars and above-the-line crew were helicoptered in, too) months into the Production. A chant arose from the catering tent, “The French Tarts are here!” and the extras, who were almost all male, went running down Forshay Meadows to greet them. They lifted the women up, with all of their luggage, and carried them back to camp. Tony told me the women were actual French Tarts. “They looked like they were rode hard and put away wet.” he said.

The Minimum Wage in Oregon in 1968 was $1.10 an hour! But in Film Unions, you’d get “time & ′₂ ′ (overtime) after 8 hours, and golden, or double time after 12. If you are working 14-hour days at minimum wage, that’s $19.80 . But in a film union you also get room and board and per diem. Which at that time was a lot more than $5.20 a day. But that wasn’t all. You get a 2^(nd) meal, too. And in the middle of nowhere, having to drive 2 hours to find food, especially late at night when the whole town is closed, presents a problem. And there were night shoots, and no food. I always knew that the most important item on a set was food, and this proves it. Add to all of that the fact that the local rednecks were beating you up when you went to town, and shooting at you at night in your tipi or tent when you stayed put, made it easy to want to leave. Except that you were established in the film, and you knew you were being counted on to stay. That is when the strike happened. And that is also when Governor Tom McCall came to the rescue. He had the State Police put up roadblocks to the set. If you weren’t a long-haired hippie you didn’t get in. The County Mounties took over after things calmed down. And the caterer made extra supplies for the extras. He loved them and they loved him. His name was Dominic. And they got $25 a day which included their per diem. In case you were wondering, I thought I’d set the record straight in lieu of this report on IMDBPro Trivia: “… the (Paint Your Wagon) shoot attracted local vagrants and hippies, who stole food and supplies from the set. …. (The Director, Joshua) Logan cast them as extras, though they refused his instructions to cut their hair or wear period clothing. Eventually the extras organized a makeshift union, demanding $25 a day payments and commissary bags full of food for fellow hippies. Joshua Logan, aggravated by an overlong shoot and lacking replacements, gave in to their demands.” But the extras weren’t the only ones with demands: according to Warren Merrill’s son Brent Merrill and his Mom Donna, Actor Lee Marvin allegedly walked off the set until the Producers honored his request that his friend Warren handle their Transpo problems.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:13:3fe93e009316", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 833, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "period clothing.

Lee had shot Pillars of the Sky in the Wallowas in 1956, and evidently knew Warren from back then. More on Lee Marvin and Warren Merrill in the next chapters: As America turned from Peace in 1967 to Violence in 1968, I foundmyself doing the opposite, going from violence to peace. I was 15 San Francisco. But a local cop picked me up and drove me to school when he saw me with my thumb out under an exit sign on Main St. that said: “Weed/San Francisco.” It wasn’t just the violence, my Mom had left my Dad the fall before; I was thrust into being a Mom to 4 kids, including my Dad, who was inconsolable. So, in the spring of ’67 my Mom came back and we moved to Peacenik Eugene when I turned 16. It was also near my beloved Danish Grandfather’s 1870 farm, about 20 miles north of us. To me Eugene was paradise. The kids I made friends with in the new neighborhood were U of O professors kids going to South Eugene High. They wore flowers in their hair instead of the proverbial curlers and western wear of K Falls. No one was getting murdered. You didn’t have to walk with a broken coke bottle for protection. There were no Indians with broken hearts getting the Termination Ax from the government. There was music and art and drama everywhere. I signed up immediately for all three. I soon became an usher for their Summer play production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying to get to watch the show for free. Where I grew up I hadn’t been a part of a real production before, I had just put on my own made-up plays on the porch of a housing project since I was seven. But the plays in Eugene had art and music and drama all in one place. And it became my refuge as I tried to acclimate to a very high-performance school, so different from what I’d ever known. The Theater kids became my tribe. Art Class is where I met my life’s Soul Mate, Philip Krysl.

After we performed it for her class, the teacher and director of the whole Drama Program came up to me. His name was Ed Ragozzino and he was a legend locally. He had bright eyes and a beaked nose and didn’t miss a thing. This hawk-person spoke very softly and said: “Kathy, you are a natural actress.” My friend Claudia got an A on her final and I floated out of the room. But it never occurred to me that I could pursue acting professionally. So, I went on to the Country Club High School where I discovered I was a Poet, got published, and met an accountant. But before I would commit to him that summer after graduating, I ran with my wild theater friends from South Eugene High on the U of O campus. And there, on July 8^(th) , 1969, The Bus Came By and I Got On. It doomed my marriage from the start. I had been a sketchy student my whole life. As the daughter of two schoolteachers that was not good, but I was a voracious reader. I flunked science in the 6^(th) grade, but won a Gold at the Science Fair. I had flunked English at South as a junior, but got straight A’s my senior year. I attributed the former to luck, the latter to medicating with cigarettes and coffee, the old country doctor’s prescription for ADD. At the time, I was just doing it for the money; College was hard and expensive. I was determined to get on the Dean’s list my freshman year and I did. I was writing papers that my professors read out loud in class. I rebelled against just being another pretty face. I was smart, I was serious. And I was never going back. And I loved Ken Kesey. He took me seriously. Never hit on me. Respected me. I found solace at his Farm, and intellectual stimulation. I had finally met him over a Dairy Queen Hot Fudge Sunday a few months after working with Hagen and Uly. I had helped a friend of theirs move with my pick-up truck. His name was Lew Melsen and he had an Éclair 16mm camera. Kesey owned the Arriflex that Hagen used, I think Uly had a Bolex, and a Nagra.

They all shared everything, and all of these filmmakers and more were on the bus. Kesey had a great story about cameras. He told the story of his Dad’s first office in a barn for a dairy co-op. The office workers were women and back then wore heels to work, even in a barn loft. Sometimes they would trip on the rough-hewn stairs. So, Fred, Ken’s dad, put a mirror on the wall opposite the stairs so they could see where they were stepping and wouldn’t trip. Of course, it was an allegory. He pointed out that people were on their best behavior when they had a camera filming them. They wouldn’t trip up, because they were more conscious of what they were doing. They could literally see themselves better when a camera was rolling, as if it was reflecting their image back to them. At the time, the Golden Age of Film in LA was mostly studio musicals. Ken wanted to document real tripping with a camera, and he did. Jack Kerouac, the author of the groundbreaking book On the Road was a friend and on the bus. So, they both created the seminal “Road Trip.” The psychedelic bus trip to New York for the publication of Sometimes a Great Notion was Kesey’s Cinematic Holy Grail. But at the time, Kesey would edit, and re-edit, all over again. And he would make us watch it, a lot. The problem was that Mike Hagen was standing in the bus running the camera for a lot of the filming; and the bus was being driven by Neal Cassidy. Hagen would lurch one way trying to keep his balance. While Neal was lurching the opposite. And the footage made me seasick. I always had to walk out onto the porch for fresh air. One time Ken followed me out. I was smoking a cigarette. He didn’t get his squirt gun out and shoot at my cigarette, as he was known to do. He didn’t even give me a hard time about it. He just said softly “I know we will be friends for a very, very, long time.” Later, in 1990, Ken and I were using Mason Williams’ new-fangled video editing machine. I kept getting bubbles I couldn’t edit out, because they kept getting pushed forward to the next frame. Ken pulled the video tape out from the canister, took a pair of scissors to cut out a 3-inch piece containing the bubbles, scotch taped the ends back together, and Voila! they disappeared. Brilliant!

The Arriflex 16mm camera that Hagen used to film on the Psychedelic Bus in 1964 was also the instrument of revolution in Czechoslovakia. Milos Forman said that the State school offered several careers, but for the Prague school of arts, the Communists couldn’t afford the Mitchell cameras they were using in Hollywood. But what they got instead was trained “Miracle Artists” who were creating Subterfuge Cinema with these new lightweight Arriflex cameras. The films seemed to be so much about one thing, but they were really stories about another (the political underground) so well done that even their Russian censors didn’t catch it, because it was so poetic in its subterfuge, until “Fireman’s Ball” 1967. “Forman was one of the most important directors of the Czechoslovak New Wave. His 1967 film The Fireman’s Ball, on the surface a naturalistic representation of an ill-fated social event in a provincial town, was seen by both movie scholars and authorities in Czechoslovakia as a biting satire on Eastern European Communism, resulting in it being banned for many years in Forman’s home country.” The closest thing I can recall, to illustrate this, was from the film Visions of Light; when Cinematographer Conrad (Connie) Hall filmed Robert Blake’s character confessing about murdering people in Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. While the way he confessed was in cold blood, “the shadows on his face caused by the rain running down the window cried for him.” That is Poetic Cinema. And this lyrical but complex layered-meaning Poetic Cinema was similarly being created in France, appropriately called “La Nouvelle Vague” (The New Vague Cinema) vague as in Poetic, (the opposite of “Reality TV”) and also in Germany; together creating this New Wave of Cinema throughout the world, eventually known to us as “The New Hollywood” that had exploded on the scene with Easy Rider (1969) another Road Trip movie, using these portable cameras. On a national level, Route 66 was being romanticized in a song and TV show. The portable cameras were perfect for these television shows and movies inspired by Kerouac’s roman á clef novel On the Road. And so began the films set against on- location road trips, like the explosive Easy Rider (1969), and Monte Hellman’s Two Lane Blacktop (1971).

About that time, when I first heard of Marshall McCluan’s book: The Medium is the Message, I was thinking “Yeah, and the technology to tell it in the first place is what creates new story-lines!” The American Indian people I knew were oral storytellers; they were highly revered in their tribe because they were the keepers of the stories for a Millennium. If they forgot ONE word, all hell broke loose. Storytellers like Ed Edmo actually use their whole body. When he talks about the Salmon people, he becomes the Salmon People. Ed is a poet. He also inspired Sherman Alexi to become a writer. Some stories became limericks to better remember them. Songs helped people remember the stories too, especially if they rhymed. Volumes of stories were printed, in all sorts of verse. I worked on the very first Film for the Deaf. They use sign language, which is even more articulate than the spoken word. They say hearing people over dramatize their facial expressions, which is why the deaf make great film actors. Theater requires vocal projection and facial expressions to reach the back of the room; film requires subtlety projected on a 40-foot silver screen. It was an exciting time in 1969, and I too was experiencing creative control, over my own life. I was traveling to San Francisco, where I loved the food and the architecture. I went to the Avalon Ballroom to see Crosby Stills Nash and Young with The Jefferson Airplane and made a moody film with Hagen in the November rain at the U of O graveyard that we called Untitled Girl. Meanwhile, back on the farm, Kesey was still editing. He had thousands of feet, after all. Surely there was the story in there somewhere? It would be technically possible in 40- some years to ballast the footage, sync the sound, and restore the print, but he was determined to not quit trying to his dying day. He and Ken Babbs would send them out, trusting people to pay them when they got it. He made several versions, too. So that’s where I got that from. And he always had film friends trying to help him. From what I understand, the original reason for even forming Far West Action Picture Services (FWAPS) in 1969 was to edit this film for Kesey.

A man called Gary Neustaeder had a company called Biosphere with Jonathan Schwarz in the Smeed Hotel; Ron Finne and Loren Sears were making incredible experimental films, and Kesey was creating the title sequence to his movie with animation and with such incredible special effects, I can only say they might have been made by the same people who were creating the Light Shows for The Grateful Dead at The Fillmore in San Francisco. But, it wasn’t until this road trip movie came to film in Eugene, Oregon in 1969 titled Five Easy Pieces, that Poetic Cinema became a truly commercial success. And it was just a fluke that Oregon can claim it. This film would reverberate forever in the hearts of filmmakers like me. Why? It’s all in this article I wrote for the Oregon Confluence in April of 2017, celebrating Jack Nicholson’s 80^(th) Birthday. And I love it because, in the late 60’s in Eugene, Oregon, we were also trying make films on another level, by experimenting with 16mm “shorts.” We would make a short film or shoot a short scene as long as the “ends” of the Army Navy Surplus store’s silver-nitrate film-stock pieces would allow us, similar to the way a Sonnet poem would only allow 14 lines. Otherwise, we needed to find a very expensive Movieola to splice it all together. In his Village Voice “Movie Journal” columns, Jonas Mekas captured the makings of an exciting movement in 1960s American filmmaking. Works by Andy Warhol, Gregory J. Markapoulos, Stan Brakhage, Jack Smith, Robert Breer, and others echoed experiments already underway elsewhere, yet they belonged to a nascent tradition that only a true visionary could identify. Mekas incorporated the most essential characteristics of these films into a unique conception of American filmmaking’s next phase. He simplified complex aesthetic strategies for unfamiliar audiences and appreciated the subversive genius of films that many dismissed as trash. This movement created the “New Hollywood” 1969-1977, which first arrived in Oregon the fall of 1969. These films all seemed to have something in common. They seemed to be influenced by the German New Wave, the French Nouvelle Vague, and the Czech Miracle Artists such as Milos Forman, Vilmos Zsigmond and Laszlo Kovacs. Laszlo was the Cinematographer on many of Jack Nicholson’s films: Hell’s Angels on Wheels (1967) The Trip (1967) Psyche-Out (1968) Head (1968) Easy", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:19:c18a8971cad5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 839, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "many dismissed as trash.

Five Easy Pieces (1970) Drive He Said (1971) The King of Marvin Gardens (1972.) And Laszlo came back to Oregon without Jack, for Getting Straight (1972) but with Jack’s Producer. We will explore Jack’s Oregon Films in the next chapters, but for this chapter, we will focus on Thanksgiving Day, 1969. Panavision HQ in LA still celebrates that day with this mural of that scene, because of the focus pull. Ron Vidor (right) and Laszlo Kovacs (left) posed in front of it, not long before Laszlo died in 2007. We were all driving up I-5, going on a location for the film, (the San Juan Islands) and saw Denny’s Restaurant and stopped to look at it. Bob Rafelson, (the Director) said it was perfect, and within minutes we had permission to shoot. I had the feeling it was mostly improvised. When Jack swept the table with his arm, it all ended up on me, as I was in position as the focus puller for the camera. That is what Laszlo was famous for, incredible camera shots, and miraculous 360-degree pans. It occurred to me that the incredible focus pull was Laszlo’s way of foreshadowing, by subconsciously conjuring from the far distant north hills the dysfunctional dynamic of Jack’s family and then focus-pulling them straight into the restaurant where they were invisibly kicking him under the table. Someone must have called Governor Tom McCall’s Film Commissioner Warren Merrill (Oregon’s first) because he’s also in the photos Ron has. He was probably the one who let them know that the only place in town to get a good Thanksgiving Dinner was at the Eugene Hotel, one of the most celebrated hotels in Oregon at the time. They stayed an amazing 5 days in Eugene, shooting a bowling alley, AND road sequences: drive-by shots of the car, (their 1968 Mercury Monterey was the picture car, camera car and camera mount) on the old Route F, now Highway 126 to the coast, through a covered bridge by Lowell on Highway 58, and by a wigwam on a body of water, under some train tracks, all between Lowell and Florence, Oregon. And I can’t help but think it was Laszlo, who chose Eugene because of LCC’s architecture, for New Wave ascetic reasons.

With its concrete and steel beam construction, it looked very much like a prison. And another poetic layer to add to the storyline, which essentially says that Modern Collegiate schools are a Prison. Warren even had a way to get an unfinished community college to open its doors to California filmmakers. No doubt Governor Tom McCall lent his significant pull to the decision. He was a horse trader, and it may be why he was “the Ribbon Cutter” that fall after production wrapped, and the school officially opened. Except larger than life Tom McCall brought a chainsaw and cut a log instead. He was an avid Sound Equipment geek, and had over had 100 telephone lines leased to distribute background music to banks and retail stores throughout the community. He worked on many films, including The Way West where he became life-long friends with Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas and especially John Mitchum, Robert’s brother. Mike recalls Director Richard Rush allowing him to stand by the camera for the whole shoot. And Richard would go on to direct The Stuntman, a fairly successful film with Oscar noms. I can’t help but think that Mike Dilley inspired him to direct it. Because Mike Dilley always gives 100% to any job, including as a stunt man on Getting Straight, especially when he crashed into a wall while swinging on a rope in a student protest scene. What is curious is that there is only one other Eugene actor I knew back then (besides tons of extras) on the film. Julia Anne Robinson was just an acquaintance from South Eugene, the communities’ theatrical Diva, until she was discovered for this film for a non-speaking role as a VW driver. Soon after she left town, Ken Kesey ran into her once in New York on the street. She was a model! She then had a co-starring role in Jack’s King of Marvin Gardens (1972). I have no idea if she was under contract with Columbia, or if she was one of the Eugene, Oregon girls that Jack was always falling for (like my friend Mimi Machu) but by 1975 she was back in Eugene, renting an apartment out South Willamette street, dating my roommate Wane in yet another one of our communes.

It included directors Richard Rush, Bob Rafelson; screenplay writers Carole and Charlie Eastman; Editors and Directors Monte Hellman and Henry Jaglom; Actors Bruce Dern, Karen Black, and Mireille Machu. And last but not least, Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs. Especially Laszlo, who as a product of the great East European film legacy of Vienna and Budapest with Vilmos Zsigmond, didn’t want to film any more of their Biker Movies The Wild Angels (1966) Hell’s Angels on Wings (1967) or Drug Movies Psyche Out (1968); especially when it came time to do Easy Rider (1969). They came to America to show their film, that they felt the world needed to see, and were looking for their Viennese Cinematography hero, Zoli Vidor. Zoli was a cinematographer in a huge film studio in Vienna, when 18 years earlier he also had to flee; this time it was Hitler’s invasion of Austria in 1938. They thought Zoli could help get the footage into the right hands. Zoli, who had been famous in Europe, had to start from the bottom in America, but by then was already well established. But he didn’t have any connections to the TV networks. Zoli was the father of my dear friend Ron Vidor, who had started in film on “Candid Camera” in 1963 and worked his way up to Grease 2, Rocky 3, Jaws, then Stand By Me where I met him. And it was after four years of these kind of films, when Hopper wanted Laszlo to film Easy Rider that he finally changed Laszlo’s mind. He convinced Laszlo that Easy Rider would be different. After all, he was finally directing, wasn’t he? Didn’t Laszlo believe what he had said just a few years earlier? So, Peter Fonda re-wrote Easy Rider as a modern day “Existential Western,” and history was made. This film was a Chopper Road Trip, with a Comic Book Hero and an Archaic Cowboy as Protagonists, a Psychedelic Western; all of these the same elements that exploded on the literary scene from Ken Kesey, between 1962 with Cuckoo’s Nest, and Sometimes a Great Notion, and then the Psychedelic Bus Trip in 1964, filmed with a Portable Arriflex. “The Arriflex 35 also played a key role in what has been called The Hollywood New Wave… (films) being made by a small, interrelated group of innovative filmmakers, working with lightweight equipment, small crews, and comparatively low budgets", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:22:6c51846d5550", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 842, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "Protagonists, a Psychedelic Western; all of these the same elements that exploded on the literary scene from Ken Kesey, between 1962 with Cuckoo’s Nest, and Sometimes a Great Notion, and then the Psychedelic Bus Trip in 1964, filmed with a Portable Arriflex. “The Arriflex 35 also played a key role in what has been called The Hollywood New Wave… (films) being made by a small, interrelated group of innovative filmmakers, working with lightweight equipment, small crews, and comparatively low budgets (who) take their films very seriously. Kovacs was at the heart of this Hollywood Renaissance.” From Norris Pope’s book Chronicles of a Camera: The Arriflex 35 in North America. 2 The success of Easy Rider is what made Jack Nicholson a star, and within months, he was in Eugene for Five Easy Pieces (1970). It also made the style of Poetic Cinema a resounding commercial success instead of just an art house success, which in turn made Jack an even bigger star. This is what may have convinced Paramount to give him funding to return a few months later with his own film crew and cameras to direct his own work Drive He Said (1971). But after that incredible work in Five Easy Pieces, Laszlo may not have been so available. After 10 years of no-budget toil, Kovács’s camera broke Hollywood’s rules with Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper (Blue Velvet). Suddenly in demand, he recommended Vilmos to both Peter Fonda (Race With the Devil) and Robert Altman (3 Women), where Zsigmond poured his “poetic realism” into Fonda’s The Hired Hand (1971) and Altman’s Mccabe & Mrs. Miller (1971.) The two cinematographers quickly became the go-to camera guys of the New Hollywood, ultimately yielding some 140 movie credits between them, including Kovács’ Five Easy Pieces, Paper Moon, Shampoo and Ghostbusters and Zsigmond’s Scarecrow, Cinderella Liberty, The Rose, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Blow Out and The Deer Hunter.3 As far as I am concerned, Jack is forgiven for not getting the protesters he was filming out of jail, because he was busy hiding the footage from the cops, who were after it, and was anxiously awaiting the news that the footage had been secreted away in the trunk of a friend’s car, and was safely across the state border. Jack can also be forgiven for his early 70’s style of casting, like this cheerleader, above, because the other people he brought together on this film created an Oregon Cast and Crew not only experienced and with a credit; but it bonded the Eugene film community in such a deep way that many of us would go on to work together through the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 2000’s Then there was Peter Roscoe as an extra, a writer who would become a part of our Oregon Film Factory gang later in the 70’s; and HJ Langtry, my 60’s dorm buddy, here", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:23:0d84517fb713", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 843, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "he brought together on this film created an Oregon Cast and Crew not only experienced and with a credit; but it bonded the Eugene film community in such a deep way that many of us would go on to work together through the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 2000’s Then there was Peter Roscoe as an extra, a writer who would become a part of our Oregon Film Factory gang later in the 70’s; and HJ Langtry, my 60’s dorm buddy, here in 1981, with another dorm mate Rick Johnson and myself, and Beverly Cadbury, wife of legendary film instructor Bill Cadbury. This image was shot by Bill Goodpasture for our new company, Associated Film Production Services. So how did all these Eugene actors and filmmakers get jobs on Drive He Said? The same way I almost did. One day, in April of 1970, the now-bonded- freshmen of the 4^(th) floor Earl –McClure dormitory (both men and women) attended the protests against the ROTC on campus, at Johnson Hall, which was the Administration Building on the U of O Campus. I lost it. “Are you kidding me?” I said. “I’m flunking Biology, and I just don’t have the time!” Truth was, I was afraid. I had been to a huge protest in October the year before, for a Moratorium on the War in Vietnam; I had been involved the previous summer with the President of the Student Body, Kip Morgan, who had found his Years later, Kip, David and I and most of my dorm mates are still friends. And here’s why I don’t feel so bad about my rap sheet: One of the most active protesters and avid supporters of Kip would become a State Legislator from my district. His name is Phil Barnhart, and he eventually helped Oregon Film with its film incentives as the Chair of the Revenue committee. Another longtime friend, Skip Cosper, was Jack’s 2^(nd) AD on Drive He Said. Fresh out of the very first DGA training program, and originally from another small NW town in NE Washington, Skip is also a screenplay writer. He was Philip’s and my neighbor in McKenzie Bridge for a few years. He was a great supporter of my writing, and helped Philip get work on Return to Lonesome Dove in 1993 in Montana. Sometimes A Great Notion (1970). It was one of the largest independently produced film budgets in history at the time. The “New Hollywood” was opening the doors for riskier projects, but it was made several years before One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), so it didn’t have that film’s Blockbuster status behind it. Paul Newman went way out on a limb to make it. Even Kirk Douglas had a hard time getting Cuckoo’s Nest made.

What is important to note is that this book is considered by a lot of us as Kesey’s “Magnum Opus.” He said it almost killed him. For both books, he went deeply into the collective unconscious to tap into an American archetype. And then, like Persephone, it seemed that he brought back Spring into the Barren Wasteland of Modernist literature (like TS Elliott’s Wasteland and Post Modernism’s Robert Frost.) Kesey’s depiction of Western Oregon rain, for instance, transcends any normal description. It is fundamentally Paganist, American Indian, Psychedelic.4 It was a new mythology, and it came from a combination of his double cross-cultural Oregon environment, a land of Cowboys and Indians, Farmers and Mountain Men. And it also came from a landscape of lore like Horatio Alger’ss fantasies of the West. Oregon was where a young man could be free of the masks of civilization in the land of rugged individualism. It was an Oregon pioneer ethic to collaborate, as well as to “Circle the Wagons” against outsiders, both civic and social. I heard a story that in 1962 Jack Nicholson tried to buy the rights to Kesey’s other book, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1962), but Kirk Douglas had already bought the film rights when it was still in galley form. Jack and Don Devlin were working together writing Thunder Island in 1962 for Associated Producers, who had made Oregon Trail in 1959. Jack said back then he wanted to create a “Film Studio” of projects that had what he called “added content” or were made “on another level”; and was shopping for projects in the Northwest. Jack bought the rights to Don Berry’s Moontrap (1962). Dennis Hopper had also bought the rights to Don Berry’s Trask (1960). Even Michael Douglas once came to Blue River to talk to Skip Cosper about his script Wild Man Toby, that he was trying to get his dad Kirk Douglas to produce. What is it about these Oregon stories that draw these incredible filmmakers to them? And what is it about filming here that makes them return again and again and again? In 1970, filming Sometimes a Great Notion, Paul Newman spent several months on the Oregon Coast, first as its star, and soon as its director. From Toledo to Florence, tales of his drinking went largely un-noticed, because compared to the rest of us Oregon drinkers, he seemed to fit right in.

Not to mention compared to the wildness of Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, who were known to be on set, drag-racing with him on logging skid-roads. Another amazing film was being made in 1970, but it was a lowly 16mm camera in the woods of Oregon. The cameraman was Art Dubs. Newly single, with 3 kids to raise, Art decided to just film the beauty of Oregon that he had found on his hunting trips. He was a depression-era child, who pulled himself up by the bootstraps out of poverty, and became a multi-millionaire with that camera. American Wilderness (1970) was the result, with footage of The Rogue River and Central Oregon. He began to ^(*)4 -wall” it around Oregon, and it gained so much attention, he opened up his own film company and made 3 more, with an ever- widening scope of footage that he shot of the expanded American Wilderness, including Alaska, and the World. In 1975, he created a story that starred unknowns, (which I heard were based on his children:) “The Wilderness Family.” It was so popular it out-performed even the Rocky Movies on Television. He made two sequels, and several other films in the 80s, including two involving stories with American Indians. He was truly an Oregon-made man, who thought outside the box and did things his own way. He made Oregon Westerns that were Bi-cultural, moral, had landscape as a character, and collaborative. His low-budget films made more money back per dollar spent than any other independent filmmaker living and filming in Oregon in history. He was in Eugene’s first rock and roll band, “The Hammond Typewriter” and had worked evenings at the Crystal Ship Record Store and afternoons at the Eugene Country Club. He had gone to the U of O on a golf scholarship from the Eugene Country Club, and they also gave him a job there. My Mom was elated. In 1969, during the days of Spring Term, he had been my student teacher in Political Science at Sheldon High School. He was very good with money, was hired to do books at several record stores, and got a bank loan to open our own record store that fall, called “Sherwood Forest.” His brother Jim was the youngest manager ever at 1st National Bank, so that helped. Long hairs were not known to get bank loans for hippie businesses. He also orchestrated the SBA loan for Cinema 7, a film art house that emerged out of the record store.

Cinema 7 was really the brainchild of Steve Bove, a friend of ours from Sheldon High who lived in our record store in the Mayflower Theater. No doubt listening through the walls to the movies shown there all night inspired Steve. My first date with Kip Morgan had been at the Mayflower Theater, and Kesey would take a bunch of us there to watch a movie together; but there was nowhere to showcase all the incredible films coming out of Europe; or our own films, either, out of Eugene, except for the U of O classrooms, which I hated. We were spoiled by the great theaters of the previous era. They were big studio movie theaters, for the most part. In the meantime, we kept filming our own films with the new crew from Drive He Said; and showed them at Cinema 7. The Oregon Repertory Theater was right next door, and we co-mingled a lot in the back rooms. We also showcased Eugene’s own Cannes award winner Don Cato’s and Regional award winner Ron Finne’s films. Then one day, we at Cinema 7 started making our own. My favorite was called Tangles. Shot in black and white with a 16mm camera, I played a Mermaid who was dying in the tide on the rocks at Yachats. My sister, played by Barb Embree, was a normal human girl who had stolen my mysteriously symbolic hair combs, knowing it would kill me, but thinking they would make her beautiful. Instead they turned her into a Sea Hag. And she died. Then I suddenly lived as a normal human again. The combs were a blessing and a curse. All those films are lost. We all loved the movies, just as entertainment. And when Jay and I first met in 1969 I was student teaching at a grade school; and he and my Mom thought that was what I was going to do with the rest of my life. I was to settle down and get married upon graduation, get a job teaching High School English (so I could teach poetry) and live happily ever after.

Finally, after missing a Final at the U of O in order to see The Rolling Stones in Seattle early June of 1972, I just quit. English Lit was killing me. I was having to write papers on my least favorite authors, like Samuel Becket, Malloy Malone Dies and The Un-nameable; Harlan Ellison’s I Have No Mouth but I Must Scream, while trying to apply a Philosophical Existential Theory to them, like the Buber and Jasper’s “I-Thou” theory. It just wasn’t working. I couldn’t really afford to finish school, either, because I couldn’t afford to turn down all the modeling and film work I was getting. I told my classmates jokingly that “I just got kidnapped by a 16mm camera” when they asked me why I wasn’t still in school. Lucky for me, films started to come to Oregon with some real budgets that summer. Never-the-less, it was the pinnacle of the whole decade of brotherly and sisterly love energy; the performances were suburb, the whole concert was like Nirvana, the end was a perfectly timed sunset, a ball of fire on notes of night from the band, and 10,000 people were stunned into silence by the last song. And they got it all on film. The next day, back at the Eugene Hotel, I started at the bottom emptying ashtrays. Then became the filmmakers’ go-to girl for anything they needed. I ended up doing body make-up for the dancers. I did their hair. Then I did some costumes. And before I knew it, I was getting into the scenes and laying down the dialog, first for one scene and then another; fully clothed, mind you. Because, unlike the dancers, I wasn’t afraid of the cameras and the boom mics. ( Just Hagen’s Nagra clip-on wired mic that would shock me when it rained.) I was always a little embarrassed by this “girlie” film. Until I saw that the Writer and Asst. cameraman was none other than the Barry Levinson. His first real film. My first real film. He was the main camera guy I liked, but I didn’t know his name until now. Then I thought, sheesh, if Laszlo and Vilmos and Barry Levinson had to start making money like this somewhere, why not me? But what is even more amazing is that Roger Corman’s new company, New World distributed it.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:28:6638331675dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 848, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "“girlie” film.

But what is even more amazing is that Roger Corman’s new company, New World distributed it. So not only did I start like Barry Levinson, from the ground up, but I have come full circle in this chapter because I started in the same way as my poetic cinema heroes had started: Laszlo, Vilmos, Milos, Jack, Peter, Dennis and Monte Hellman: The B Movies, most of them with Roger Corman. “This movie is about one hell of a man who lived when Dillinger [ John Dillinger] was slamming banks, and Roosevelt [Franklin D. Roosevelt] was awakening the nation. He’s a hard-time fast-tracker who’s been where it’s mean. A grizzly with a sense of humor, an adventurer with holes in his pockets. A wandering rebel, living off the land by his wits and his fists. He goes it alone, he does what he wants - for the beautiful pure sweet hell of it. Who’s going to stop him - you? Now he’s taking on his biggest run. A challenge no one ever survived. That’s why he has to do it!.” “It’s a widely-held belief that the years 1967-76 represent the “golden age” of American cinema. Just look at a few of these titles: Rosemary’s Baby, Medium Cool, Romeo and Juliet, True Grit, Catch-22, Love Story, The Godfather I & II, Don’t Look Now, Harold and Maude, Chinatown, Shampoo, Marathon Man, to name a few. Basho, an Edo-period poet, claimed that Haiku (ancient and rigorous Japanese poetry) manifests itself to the observer when “you have plunged deep enough into the object to see something like a hidden glimmering….” Poetic cinema is the chasm that gets us closer to that “glimmering” and replaces being with inter-being through distilling us into its images of immediate experience. A cinema of poetry then could utilize the chaotic ether of dream/ memory, forgo logical spatio-temporal consistency, record complex everyday human gestures or events or provide a sense of immersive visual urgency. With the term ”poetic” being still amorphous when applied as a criteria, the films on the list will construct a possible correlation, though ultimately condensed, of some films that inhabit one or all of the mentioned ideas.” “What do you think most studios would have said to me if I went to them and said, “I want to make the story of 18-year-old boy who falls in love with an 80-year-old woman, to be directed by an acid head (Hal Ashby) and written by a guy who cleans swimming pools (Colin Higgins)”?", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:29:8cb347a300c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 849, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "the films on the list will construct a possible correlation, though ultimately condensed, of some films that inhabit one or all of the mentioned ideas.” “What do you think most studios would have said to me if I went to them and said, “I want to make the story of 18-year-old boy who falls in love with an 80-year-old woman, to be directed by an acid head (Hal Ashby) and written by a guy who cleans swimming pools (Colin Higgins)”?

Because Mark just didn’t give up on me that day, he would go on to be my film mentor for the next 36 years. He still mentors young people at Actor’s Studio, in LA. And I too, have paid-it-forward, by mentoring young people into film, because that is what creates the next generation of filmmakers, and also, when we give, it tends to come back to us. • My first airplane flight, and I missed it. (Not knowing it wasn’t like a Greyhound Bus that you could just jump on at the last minute.) • My first limo ride (from the Seattle- Tacoma Airport to a mansion on Queen- Anne Hill.) • My first Hollywood entrance, where in the foyer I promptly tripped on a Turkish runner and fell down. • My first Movie Premiere just hours later. • My first Indian Protest. (There were a group of AIM members protesting the depiction of American Indians in John Wayne’s movies, and this was the Premiere of Kahill US Marshall.) • My first encounter with any kind of movie star, let alone several of them, including John Wayne, Marsha Mason, Eli Wallach, and James Caan, the last 3 in the Limo with me and Mark. Without my ever knowing about it, my photographer friend with Cerebral Palsy, Dan Webb, had attended the conference. During the luncheon, he had walked up to Mark Rydell and Vilmos Zsigmond and put a photo of me in front of them without saying a word. Then he gave them my phone number and left. Just like that. Why Mark didn’t cast this role out of the thousands of actresses at the Seattle Rep and/or from Lola Holliwell’s Casting files, I’ll never know.

Including Animal House. The old Catch 22: It takes a film credit to get a film job and a film job to get a film credit. That’s why I mentor. But there is also a saying: “A Poet is never recognized in her own country.” We all had to go to the Big City to get discovered, so we could come back recognized; or even go on to conquer the world. And I would go on to LA, and then return to Seattle many times for many years for many reasons. Some of the best film people came out of first auditioning and being accepted by the Seattle Repertory, and some of them were my oldest friends from Oregon. The friends I had from Eugene that went on to Seattle and made amazing careers were: actor Dan Mayes, actress Kathy Neal, costumer Frances Kenney, my production assistant Jennifer Hunt, South Eugene actor David Norfleet (who was also cast in Cinderella Liberty with me) Actors Russ Fast, Andy Traister, Joel Morello, and my favorite, who wasn’t a friend from Oregon, but also had a bit part in a film I worked on there, was Brandon Frazer. The Mummy Franchise Star. But everyone went to Hollywood after their bit part, and that is what Mark Rydell and Vilmos Zsigmond told me that I needed to do too. And they helped me do it. But first we had a movie to make in Seattle, and what was supposed to be a one-day bit- player role for me became a month on set, all expenses paid. Then we all went on to Hollywood from there, together, including my girlfriend Lucretia. Lynn Goepferd (Lucretia’s real name) had flown up when Rydell said he needed another actress for our scene with Eli Wallach, and could I please find one. The Mansion had rooms galore, and was the “Above the Line” Hotel and HQ. Eli Wallach, James Caan and Marsha Mason would come over on Sundays for “a family dinner,” made by an aging Hollywood Character Actor named Victor, an old friend of Rydell’s from New York. It was the very last day of filming, but the importance of it in the story kind of got lost when the whole shoot was shut down by a sabotaged generator.

It was the very last day of filming, but the importance of it in the story kind of got lost when the whole shoot was shut down by a sabotaged generator. Evidently the film let the generator operator leave early, and the “Genny” truck driver flipped the power switch. Seattle was where the Teamsters started, and they were not going to let that go. So, I had to return the next day, all of us did, and that must have wreaked havoc on the office staff rescheduling the crew returning to LA, and the budget. I was worried I’d be type-cast for good as a Street Girl after this role; but when the costumer Rita Riggs did such a great job of making me look like one, Rydell had a conniption fit and made her put a velvet cape over my costume. I can’t tell you how great that made me feel. And later, when they tried to help me get a scholarship to USC Film School, I knew for sure I wasn’t just a pretty face to him or Vilmos. But at the time, the Mansion in Seattle seemed empty, and Rydell seemed lost. He and his Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond would argue over the days’ shot list over breakfast. He was 44 in 1973, when the young New Hollywood filmmakers were taking over. I was 22. Michael Douglas was 29. Spielberg was 27. John Milius was 27, too. Rydell, as an actor, was incredible with actors. He directed a who’s who list of actors onto Oscar nominations. So, it wasn’t his fault. I can now say that I blame the screenplays for lacking structure, being rather full of clichés instead of archetypal energies, and lacking in motivation. I learned that scripts that lack underlying motivation are called melodramas. In the meantime, Lucretia and I would attend screenings with Rydell, entertain Vilmos, including teaching him the meaning of certain cultural expressions he didn’t learn in Hungary, such as “super-charger”; and about American Music. Once I even took him to the Troubador in LA to see my friend Hoyt Axton play. He would call me once in a while, and one time in particular when he was looking to film Close Encounters of the 3^(rd) Kind, and wanted to know about the giant dirigible hangers In Tillamook County. I was so honored to get to meet John Williams on the Studio Lot. Mostly what I remember is he had a signed photograph from Marilyn Monroe on his office wall.

As I was admiring it, Rydell regaled John with the story of how he first met me, sprawled face down on the carpet from tripping on the rug in Seattle. They both howled, and when I asked them why they thought it was so funny, they told me that was how Marilyn’s first audition went. I didn’t tell them that Marilyn Monroe was Kesey’s Prankster name for me. I didn’t understand. I thought Marilyn Monroe was really what my Mom looked like, a blue-eyed blonde Dane. Later I got it when I almost died at 35 from drugs and alcohol. By then I had long decided that acting was not for me. It was one thing to do small Poetic Cinema with friends, and even for low profile film companies with small cameras; but when it came time to act on Cinderella Liberty with Academy Award level actors such as James Caan (for The Godfather) and Eli Wallach, (Honorary Lifetime Achievement Academy Award) with that giant 35mm camera, 60 crew members, right after being forced into make-up, hair, and costumes, my nerves were so shot, I threw up right before my scene. Lucretia did so much better than I did. Lynn and Mark understood, and we kept in touch. Before I knew it, Mark asked me to advise him on possible actors for his next project, A Star is Born. I told him Bette Midler and Kris Kristofferson. He had me location scout for him in Oregon for the film, too. Warren Merrill even helped me. But it went into turn-around $\\textcircled{2}$ Fox and so he made Harry and Walter Go to New York instead. With Don Devlin and Laszlo Kovaks and Harry Gittes, Jack Nicholson’s Producing Partner on Moontrap. Small world. But all this time Rydell was wholly taken by Bette Midler, especially after he watched her effervescence on Johnny Carson with me one night in Seattle. And that is when he decided to try to do a film for our generation: The Rose. I was so happy that he was finally doing this, and with Alan Bates, too! Alan was a favorite at Cinema 7. When Mark had come to Portland earlier, to promote Cinderella Liberty, we rode in a Limo to pick up film critic Ted Mahar from the Oregonian. While crossing the bridges of Portland, Mahar asked Mark what it was about the story in Cinderella Liberty that so appealed to him. I’ll never forget his answer: “All men are the fathers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:33:2f415ee02119", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 853, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "was so happy that he was finally doing this, and with Alan Bates, too!

I’ll never forget his answer: “All men are the fathers of all children,” he said. And that is why we have remained friends all these years. Thank you, Mark, for all you gave me, to make possible this incredible career. So, I made several trips to LA, to try to meet film people, and to get them to come to Oregon. One night, with a girlfriend, I ended up staying at Faye Dunaway’s house. She had just returned from Madrid, where she was making the “Three Musketeers,” and her paramour Peter Wolf, from the J. Geils Band, was there. We went to the Roxy on Sunset to see Jerry Lee Lewis, and then to a lawyer’s house to hear a friend’s new album. There were five of us in her two-seater Mercedes, and the cops pulled her over for hitting the curb on Sunset. They asked her if she’d been drinking. All I remember is she said to me, ^(α)I haven’t, have I, Kathy?” Of course not! Just Margaritas in a Blender with Quaaludes, dude! When we arrived at Abe Somner’s house, there were children sitting on the couch eating pizza, and singing their hearts out. They were Hoyt Axton’s three children, April, Mark and Michael. One of the songs playing on the record player had a line that went “April. I love you.” The little girl, April, was belting it out really loud. The album was called Life Machine and it was probably the finest album Hoyt ever made. I felt so at home there, for the first time ever in LA. Turns out that the children lived in Oregon with their mother, Katherine (nee Roberts) and Hoyt had visitation rights. He was wearing logging suspenders and was a mountain of a man. He and I became instant friends, and then over the next several years became best friends for the remainder of the next 36 years, until he died in Hamilton, Montana in 1999. He was born in Duncan, Oklahoma, once called Indian Territory, less than 35 miles from where my Oregon-born Indian Great Grandmother was buried, and my great-grand-uncle was born. Both of our Grandmothers kept their Indian heritage secret. He wrote songs about cowboys on horses with wings, bull riders, and had an Oregon sense of humor. He and Ken Kesey would wrestle each other’s minds like bears. He supported Kesey’s Poetic Hoohaw, he supported Mimi Farina’s Bread and Roses campaign, and he supported my Oregon", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:34:197864b4fb6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 854, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "Duncan, Oklahoma, once called Indian Territory, less than 35 miles from where my Oregon-born Indian Great Grandmother was buried, and my great-grand-uncle was born.

He and Ken Kesey would wrestle each other’s minds like bears. He supported Kesey’s Poetic Hoohaw, he supported Mimi Farina’s Bread and Roses campaign, and he supported my Oregon screenplays both financially and personally. In 1974, while I was in LA to see Rydell and Vilmos, I invited them both to The Troubadour to see Hoyt play. When Neil Young jumped on stage, I could have died happy. We went back to their Hotel at the Beverly Garland, and wrote Lion in the Winter together. I helped with the line “Like a ship out on an ocean made of stone.” Once again, we were collaborative, and didn’t worry about who owned what. We just helped each other as artists. Creative problem solving is collaboration at its best. From then on, Hoyt was always there for me. We traveled together in his airplane on location for several films, including Heart Like a Wheel. When I needed an actor to trigger financing for a film, he showed up. When I needed a partner for a film project, he was there. When I had my heart broken, he invited me to what he called “The Heartbreak Hotel,” (his Mom May Axton wrote the song) where he and his wife Debbie saved my life. Jeremiah the Bullfrog was the narrator of the screenplay The Happy Song. Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman fought over the role of the “Evil Wizard.” Bob Denver from Gilligan’s Island wanted to play Bobaluba. Just like Nilsson’s The Point; the songs were also love songs. After thirty-some years of various people trying to make it, he gave me an option for it on his deathbed. After Cinderella Liberty, I formed a new company called “Stage III Productions: Oregonians for Fresh Air Movies.” By now I had learned how to be a gopher, do body make- up, hair, costumes, and even suggest soundtracks; how to cast friends and visualize stars in movies and be a location scout, sort of. So why not open a one-woman production company? I printed up some business cards and soon my phone rang. This time I answered it. It was a small Indie film in Portland and they needed someone to learn sign language, be an actress, do Dracula make-up, and rent caskets. It was perfect for me. I ended up commuting by train.

It was called Deafula and the first film ever made for the deaf. John Wilder Mincey was the DP. The Producer was an exec from US National Bank. The Writer, Star, and Deaf Director Peter Wolf (not the rocker Peter Wolf) had just won an Emmy in LA for sign news. What was not to like? The pay. I didn’t know what point participation was, but I soon found out. But hey, all my expenses were covered. And we would all go down to the Hilton and party after wrap. I loved Portland in those days, and that is when I first started commuting there in earnest. Learning sign language wasn’t so bad. The people were wonderful. John Wilder Mincey had an office downtown in the old Telegraph building, right next door to Tom Moyers, the theater mogul. Portland had so much more to offer filmmakers, too, like Helen’s costumes, and theatrical make-up places. Then, when it came time to “rent a casket,” I had a whole list of mortuaries in the phone book that I could call; and the odds were better (than in Eugene) that they wouldn’t hang up, thinking you were a prankster. The Journal was interviewing us the day I scored the casket. Renting the casket was my first real set decorating job. It was for a scene in the Oregon Caves west of Grants Pass. I don’t believe any HMI lights had ever been in there before, either. The Bats didn’t like it. But they were great on film. I learned to always wear a hood around them in a cave because they will only bite you if they get caught in your hair. I learned the proper way to wrap HMI cables. I learned that my instincts for set dec were good. I only brought the 2 candelabra I owned for each side of the coffin, and I thought it was perfect. I had already learned how to change a blue-eyed blond man into a Dracula. It took me 3 hours for building the nose and dying the hair, beard and eyebrows.

And I was hired by John Wilder Mincey on many of his upcoming productions for the giant advertising company “McCann Erickson,” (the predecessor of Weiden and Kennedy;) OMSI, and others. (My friend DC Rahe worked with him, too. DC was Mincey’s favorite assistant director. DC and I would work on Stand By Me together.) Later, Peter remembers returning the favor of doing my make-up for an Alyeska Pipeline commercial for Larry Barrett Productions, and being invited to a party with the owner of the Rams after. Jack Nicholson was there, he said. But I don’t remember. What I do remember was that I had more film skills for my resume, including my other favorite thing to do besides location scouting, and that would be set design. And by the time this movie premiered the next spring, I would finally be friends with Jack Nicholson on One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. And we started making money at our Cinema 7, an arthouse that Jack Nicholson would later call “One of the finest in the world.” Film was becoming my whole world. he film adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) may be the most singularly important event in my career, and I believe it may be the same for Oregon’s film history. The book was published in 1962 by Oregonian Ken Kesey, whose family lived outside of Eugene in Pleasant Hill. 1962 was a seminal year for not only Oregon Film, but for all film, and I believe this story had a lot to do with it. Kesey graduated from the University of Oregon in 1957. His major was Speech and Communications, and included screenplay writing. All I know is that there were rumors of him kicking around LA trying to get work in the film industry after he left Oregon to pursue graduate studies at Stanford in California. The Ken Kesey I knew was a filmmaker. A “3-D” architect of story. I met him through Mike Hagen, the 16mm Arriflex camera operator on the psychedelic bus trip to New York in 1964. The Bus Trip itself became the movie Magic Trip (2011) and was the basis of the infamous non-fiction book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test published in 1968.

Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters were pioneers of the 60’s movement. As a Virgo, he had a great aesthetic eye for art. His creations included the Psychedelic Bus, his House Barn with the Zodiac painted on the floor; and he was an artistic genius at choosing his costumes, clothing, car, wife, friends and life. His art may have been psychedelic, but his stories were metaphoric, and his poems and plays were very visual, and cinematic. He was a visual artist. His life became his art. In 1970, he co-wrote a film called Atlantis Rising. Some of the images below by Jerry Dewilde are from that film: Kesey, Steinbrecher, Zonker, Zodiac, Babbs, Hagen and Butkovich. The film was shot @ Ano Nuevo Beach in California. An incredibly poetic cinema film, I only saw it once and it still haunts me. I was a little afraid of Ken, in my teenage years of 1969 and ’70. I would go to the farm and would feel overwhelmed. I found after I retreated from “the scene”; he would eventually come by where I was, because I was working with his filmmaker friends like Mike Hagen, Ulysses Cheng, Bobby Miller, Bobby Steinbrecher, Joe Valentine, Bob Laird and Lew Melson. Those are my best memories of him. All of these incredible filmmakers were initially around because of the inimitable books he wrote. And they all joined in to help with the 16mm footage he was always editing, like forever, thousands of feet of it. And that footage was, of course, the latest edit of the Bus Trip, that was memorialized in the novel, Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe. After I became a Casting Director I offered him a role in several productions, but he always turned them down. We had even tried to hire him on Animal House. The director and John Belushi had even gone out to the farm to convince him to play the Professor, but while he had a great time with them, he turned them down, and so it went to Donald Sutherland. And how can I forget Zane and Sunshine Kesey, and Ruby, Pearl, Luke, and Tangerine Steinbrecher; or John, Rachael, Casa, and Shauna Babbs?

Not to mention Summer and Sky Phoenix, because the whole River Phoenix family was staying out by Kesey’s. Irby was the UPM on Cuckoo’s Nest, and moved to Oregon soon after. Michael Douglas asked me to welcome him and his family, so I planned a barbeque at my place for him to meet some filmmaker friends. Problem was, I got in a car wreck and he had his house burn down, all in the same weekend, so we had to cancel. Before I knew it, he had moved to Pleasant Hill, and soon became close friends with Ken; and Elaine, Irby’s wife, with Faye Kesey. I was invited to the wedding when Ken’s daughter Shannon married Jay Smith, Irby’s son, who is also in the business. Irby and I would work together in ’79, again in ^(,)86 and ’90. Jay and Philip would work together in ’96. Oregon’s film world was expanding with more filmmakers. I love this vintage photo from that Hoo-Haw after-event. Other events over the years would bring film actors and songwriters like Hoyt Axton, Comedian Bill Murray, Actor Dan Blocker and Filmmaker Gus Van Sant to the farm. We would all seem to be one big happy film family. And we were, until he died. The last time I talked to him he called late in 1999 to invite Philip and I to his Y2k Millennium Party on New Year’s. We went to town dressed to the nines, but had to return home when it became clear I was coming down with the flu. Then later he wasn’t feeling well, either. I’ll never forget where I was when I heard he died. The world will never be the same. And he was here with Don Devlin, Oregon Producer Dean Devlin’s (Leverage, The Librarians) father.

Could it be the New (Poetic Cinema) Existential Western? Could Cuckoo’s Nest be the new mythology of the American Cowboy? Could a character based on a guy like Kesey’s dad (a red-headed Irishman named Fred) save the world? Did his friend at Stanford, Larry McMurtry, himself a Western Hero/ Anti-hero Writer (Lonesome Dove etc.) inspire the name (McMurtry /McMurphy?) I have been seeking answers to this question for decades. I’ve discussed it with every literate person I know. As if in answer, I found this revelation of a quote by legendary literary critic Leslie Fiedler, inside this thesis by Matthew Driscoll. Fiedler was, according to Wikipedia, directly responsible for Kesey’s getting a grant to Stanford grad school, and consequently even for his ability to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Kesey views the cowboy as a representation of the individual, autonomous self, whose last frontier is the American West, and integrates this mythical American figure into his fiction. The American West provides the setting for all of Kesey’s novels for precisely the fact that, for the American of the Fifties and Sixties, it is the Final Frontier, the site where the battle for liberated consciousness is to be waged. In his dissertation “Impressionable Landscapes: The Myth of the Frontier in Twentieth Century California Literature,” Mark Allan Thompson contends that “the myth of California has allowed the perpetuation of those utopian visions which propelled people westward” (304). While Thompson’s analysis is limited to California literature, I have to add Oregon, Washington, and Alaska to the remaining American frontiers in the twentieth century, but even these frontier lands will be corrupted and exploited during Kesey’s lifetime. According to Kesey though, hope remains. Frontier landscapes remind and inspire characters in his novels that there are alternatives to lifestyles based on materialism, consumerism, and cultural conformity. Integrating his personal experiences—his childhood in the Oregon wilderness and the model of manhood provided by his father—Kesey sees the independent and physically vital American As a young writer in the Sixties, facing the omnipotent influence of American capitalism and its many educational, financial, and cultural institutions, Kesey integrates the individuality of the cowboy into his recovery of shamanism through fiction. Thus, his homeland in Oregon, a place that Leslie Fiedler calls “one of our last actual Wests” (177), is integral in understanding what drives Kesey to design a number of his characters based upon", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:40:679400978f9c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 860, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "by his father—Kesey sees the independent and physically vital American As a young writer in the Sixties, facing the omnipotent influence of American capitalism and its many educational, financial, and cultural institutions, Kesey integrates the individuality of the cowboy into his recovery of shamanism through fiction. Thus, his homeland in Oregon, a place that Leslie Fiedler calls “one of our last actual Wests” (177), is integral in understanding what drives Kesey to design a number of his characters based upon the mythologized American cowboy. The cowboys that he incorporates into his fiction are not those of traditional American Western tales like Owen Wister’s The Virginian. Kesey’s cowboys pertain to a genre specific to the latter half of the twentieth century that Leslie Fiedler, a critic of literature from or about the American West, defines as the “New Western” in The Return of the Vanishing American (interestingly enough published in 1968). Fiedler’s vanishing Frontier continues to be explored throughout the twentieth century, to the point that scarcely a Frontier or wilderness remains. According to Fiedler, rather than being nostalgic about the changing nature of the West, the New Western is psychedelic: “But no other name fits as well as the New Western, which, like the Old Western at its most authentic, deals precisely with the alteration of consciousness. Besides, many of the so-called “psychedelics” themselves, those hallucinogenic drugs, at least, found in nature rather than synthesized in the laboratory (marijuana, peyote, the Mexican Mushroom, Ayahuasca, etc.) are our bridge to—even as they are gifts from—the world of the Indian: the world not of an historical past, but of an eternally archaic one. (175) Furthermore, in 1962, what was happening in Hollywood? John Ford’s last movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with John Wayne was released, and like this story where Jimmy Stuart as the Senator (who killed the outlaw) returns for a funeral, this film was like a funeral for the old archetype of the “American Cowboy” mythology. Just as a new one was born, in the same year (1962) rising like a Phoenix out of the ashes of what had made Hollywood great. The American Western. But this new hero’s journey was not borrowed from mythologies of ancient Greece, but emerged from the dime store comics that had replaced the dime store novel. They captured the imagination of the post-Beat generation. Kesey was called a Postmodernist Writer. I call him a Prophetic Poet of the New Age (and New Wave) partly based on William Butler Yeat’s theory of the Gyres of Time as expressed in “Second Coming” and “Byzantium.” They too were prophetic, far beyond what he could have ever imagined for the days we are living in now.

The (Yeats’) view is also true of history, for the end of an age, which always receives the revelation of the character of the next age, is represented by the coming of one gyre to its place of greatest expansion and of the other to that of its greatest contraction. At the present moment, the life gyre is sweeping outward, unlike that before the birth of Christ which was narrowing, (Piscean) and has almost reached its greatest expansion. (1949) The revelation which approaches will however take its character from the contrary movement of the interior gyre. (Aquarian) All our scientific, democratic, fact finding heterogeneous civilization belongs to the outward gyre and prepares not the continuance of itself but the revelation as in a lightning flash, though in a flash that will not strike only in one place, but will for a time be constantly repeated, of the civilization that must slowly take its place. “ Herman Northrop Frye CC FRSC ( July 14, 1912 – January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. Frye gained international fame with his first book, Fearful Symmetry (1947), which led to the reinterpretation of the poetry of William Blake. His lasting reputation rests principally on the theory of literary criticism that he developed in Anatomy of Criticism (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic Harold Bloom commented at the time of its publication that Anatomy established Frye as “the foremost living student of Western literature.”[1] Frye’s contributions to cultural and social criticism spanned a long career during which he earned widespread recognition and received many honours. Some astrologers say the Age of Aquarius actually began in 2012. That’s because they believe the star Regulus in the constellation Leo the Lion marks the ancient border between the constellation Leo and Cancer. This star moved to within thirty degrees of the September equinox point in 2012, meaning that Regulus left the sign Leo to enter the sign Virgo in that year. Presuming equal-sized constellation in antiquity, that places the border of the constellation Pisces and Aquarius at 150 degrees west of Regulus, or at the March equinox point. By this reckoning the Age of Aquaria started in 2012. Hence Kesey: (A Flower Child) a bridge between the Beats and the Hippies, emerging in 1962.

So why do I surmise this about Ken? Almost all non-literate mythology has a trickster-hero of some kind.… And there’s a very special property in the trickster: he always breaks in, just as the unconscious does, to trip up the rational situation. He’s both a fool and someone who’s beyond the system. And the trickster represents all the possibilities of life that your mind hasn’t decided it wants to deal with. The mind structures a lifestyle, and the fool or trickster represents another whole range of possibilities. He doesn’t respect the values that you’ve set up for yourself, and smashes them.… The fool is the breakthrough of the absolute into the field of controlled social orders. Ken Kesey’s literary cinematic voice was not only the interpretation of the New Age’s culture, but also the epitome of Oregon’s Cinematic Literacy. His writings were bi-cultural; his life tribal and collaborative, his descriptions of nature both microscopic and paganist, his charisma was shamanic. He was a magician and an alchemist. He spoke in meta- Mark Christensen wrote a book about him called Acid Christ. I studied Cuckoo’s Nest in a Northwest Literature class @ the U of O. The class saw McMurphy as someone who sacrificed himself to save others. A Christ-like figure. I see McMurphy as an Antiheroic American Cowboy who swaggers into the Cuckoo’s Nest, creates community and raises the consciousness of everyone around him. I see him as an Aquarian who is pouring out stars as blessings over the Earth.

But what “the vast image out of the Spiritus Mundi” revealed to him was not altogether what he thought it was when he interpreted it. For one thing, the Sphinx: “A shape with a lion body and the head of a man,” was later revealed to not be a man at all, but a woman, the Beard was found to be added on, to what was created earlier, when Egypt was ruled by The Divine Feminine. From When God Was a Woman 1976 by sculptor Merlin Stone …peaceful, benevolent matriarchal society and Goddess-reverent traditions (including Ancient Egypt) were attacked, undermined and ultimately destroyed almost completely, by the ancient tribes including Hebrews and later the early Christians. To do this they attempted to destroy any visible symbol of the sacred feminine, including artwork, sculpture, weavings and literature. The reason being that they wanted the Sacred Masculine to become the dominant power, and rule over women and Goddess energies.’ “A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun.” The pyramids and sphinx are lined up to face Orion, which is in the constellation of Leo, that depicts a Hunter with the decapitated head of a lion in his hand. This is mind-boggling, that the sphinx’s “body of a lion” has everything but its head, and points to this image of the head. The gaze of the (wo)man’s head that replaces it, as described, could also be said to be one of focusing on something very far away and inanimate, like Orion in the heavens. “In Greek tradition, it has the head of a human, the haunches of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a bird. It is mythicized as treacherous and merciless.

[2] Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an androsphinx). In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.[3] Androsphinxes (ÆN-dro-sfink-ses[3]) were the males of the sphinx species. They were physically powerful creatures with inherent magical powers and a terrifying roar. While they tended to be short-tempered and terse, androsphinxes possessed good-natured ideals and always attempted to do the right thing.[4] This denotes no actual image of indignant desert birds, but only their shadows as created by celestial bodies like the Moon or the Sun. The imagery of “indignant desert birds” connotes ones disturbed about having to take flight after a millennium of roosting or feeding in the shadows. To me it signifies the “shadow side” of humanity being brought into the light. But instead of interpreting it as being brought into the light, that’s when Yeats’s vision from Spiritus Mundi grows darkened. “the darkness drops again.” And he is tormented by what he thinks he knows. “That 20 centuries of stony sleep” meaning the 2000 years of the Piscean Eon that slept in the stone of the sphinx, but is now awakened, was “vexed” (which has alliteration connotations to “hexed”) “Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,” (The Manger of Christ). For me, this means that the Sphinx, troubled by nightmares caused by the bloodiest wars ever known to man in the name of Jesus, caused her to awaken, caused her daytime consciousness to return, like we sometimes force ourselves to do when having a nightmare. For 10,000 years she slept, but the last 2000 years were vexed. All very similar to the Sphinx in that they devour people, like they are meat, like we eat animals. But they cannot eat consciousness. Which is why the riddle of the Sphinx is so important. Once Oedipus answered the question posed in context with celestial beings, and he answered it as being human, the Sphinx devoured herself. But Yeats is right, it is the Sphinx who brings the Age of Aquarius in, like a Trojan Horse, to be born under the same star configuration as the one the Wise Men, who were Astrologers, saw. How does the song go? “When the moon is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:45:efa7f33962fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 865, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "consciousness.

How does the song go? “When the moon is in the seventh house. And Jupiter aligns with Mars”? Jupiter was the “star” light the wise men saw. Aquarius is a constellation configured either as an androgynous being with an alabaster Jar, pouring out stars of light, of consciousness and blessings on the Earth. Or is it the Holy Ghost which appeared at the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, or is Mary Magdalene, who knelt at Jesus feet and washed them with a Pitcher of water and her hair, and who was, by some accounts, married to him, and whom Christ left as the one to lead the church. But just as it was in the beginning of this article, “When God was a woman,” her brother Peter stole this from her and started an Eon of subjugation of this fact, by destroying the Magdalene Gnostic Gospel until the Nag Hammadi Library was found in 1947. “What did we lose when we lost the Mary whom the Scriptures call the Magdalene? Simply stated, we lost the color red – the deep crimson of passion, of the blood mysteries, of compassion and Eros in the Jungian sense of relatedness. And with the exile of Mary Magdalene from our consciousness, we were tragically cut off from the irrigating waters of intuition and mysticism, from feminine ways of knowing, from the deep wisdom of the body and its senses, and from our intimate kinship with all that lives. These aspects of the sacred feminine were originally embodied in the Mary who was the beloved companion of Jesus and who represented our full humanity in an intimate partnership union with the Divine Logos.” The archetype of the Goddess has been thwarted throughout history, but has quietly amassed power in the human psyche. And THAT is the Second Coming, even prophesized by Jesus: “I will send you a comforter,” but in an evolved way, and in a new day of Enlightenment. As the Aquarius archetype follows Pisces, turning from the emotional water sign to the air sign of consciousness we are reborn in Peace. My phone rang. And back then, that was an event. With no voice mail or answering machines, if you missed a call, you never knew if anyone had even called or if they did, if they would ever call back again. That’s why we used Western Union.

With no voice mail or answering machines, if you missed a call, you never knew if anyone had even called or if they did, if they would ever call back again. That’s why we used Western Union. But some people were at home more often than not, including me. And it was Oregon’s Film Commissioner, Warren Merrill. That wasn’t an easy question. I was an acolyte in the Kesey camp and he had abruptly quit the production 2 weeks in, so it was a political minefield for me. I said: “Why can’t she drive herself ?” And the answer was, she didn’t have a driver’s license, but she had a car. And she would pay for gas, and the production invited us for lunch. Just a couple of hours, he said, as a favor to him, while my husband was at work at the record store. So, I said yes. I was still 23 years old then. But we were committed in an RSVP, so I drove her there. When we arrived at the Oregon State Mental Hospital, we were directed to the film’s production office. And we were told at the production office to go to the cafeteria, as the crew were breaking for lunch. The hallways were antiseptic smelling and the walls covered in green ooze, like the disinfectant had melted the paint. Great set dec, I thought, like a bad acid trip. When we got to the cafeteria it was empty, so we sat in the front. Soon, we were surrounded by what I thought were really great looking extras. Suddenly, a nice- looking man came up to us and whispered: “If you don’t move soon, these inmates might hurt you, so come with me. And after we moved away, he said: “They kill each other over their particular spots here.” I found out later, that a lot of them were hired as cast or crew members! Even an arsonist was in the Art Department! So, we sat at the back of the room with him and his crew, on the lefthand side of the cafeteria, and watched our former seats being taken by glaring inmates. After talking to him for a while, we found out he was Haskell Wexler, the director of photography. We chatted about “where we were from” over lunch. Then there was a commotion behind me, and as I looked, there was Michael Douglas in the doorway.

Haskell was replaced by Bill Butler, the same cinematographer that replaced Haskell on The Conversation a year earlier when he was fired then, too. I don’t know why Haskell was fired, but I do know that Jack really liked Butler. Bill was a collaborator, and as Jack had said earlier, Bill was fearless. You had to be fearless to work in that building with those inmates as extras. One of them had just flown out of the 2^(nd) floor window. But I think it really was because Wexler was Old Hollywood and into staging the cameras on the set. Remember when I talked about how lightweight portable cameras changed how movies were made? They became the hallmark of the New Wave, fluid and dynamic, they gave a sense of documentary to the films, the ultimate Cinema Verité. Milos was the Director and helped invent the New Wave. He had the whole set rigged so he could just turn on a switch and film. He was directing the cameras in such a way, no one even knew if they were being filmed or not. I know that I was freaked out when having to act in front of a huge Panavision camera and 60 crewmembers. But the performances, when Milos was at the helm of the small cameras, were so sublime. I even saw my first video camera there! So, these earmarks of a New Wave Film are what made it so great: Poetic, metaphoric, mythological, subversive, anti-establishment, community oriented, individualistic but collaborative, a fluid camera, revolutionary editing, un-staged, a singular vision, i.e. an Auteur Film. I rest my case. Finally, Michael’s brother Joel Douglas approached us while Jack was getting electrocuted in the other room for the 10^( + h) time. He asked if we would be so kind as to accept his and Michael’s invitation to cocktails and hors d’oeuvres at their house after the film day wrapped. I said we’d be delighted. Jack finally made it to the chair next to me. He asked if we would like to come to his house later. I told him we were sorry, but had other plans. However, I did go to his trailer while waiting for Joel to wrap the film for the day. And Jack told me a story about how the Oregon film commissioner Warren And, according to Jack, he said to Warren: “What?

And Jack told me a story about how the Oregon film commissioner Warren And, according to Jack, he said to Warren: “What? Are you NUTS?” Evidently, Warren was then asked to not return to the set by the Director and the Producers. I had to agree with Jack’s assessment of the absurdity of it all. Even journalists like Mike O‘Brien felt it: “The rooms, like the building, lend physical dimensions to the term depression.” Then there are moments of brilliance, where Wexler and Butler seem to have complete mastery over their lenses, capturing deep, discomforting emotions through blocking and subtle movements. During McMurphy’s electroconvulsive therapy, an above shot places the film’s protagonist in a position of confounding supplication, a slow zoom adding an undeniable dread as McMurphy’s confidence dissolves, and the abject fear he’s been hiding all along behind his wit pulses naked from his pleading eyes. Only one “dose” is shown, and perhaps only one “dose” administered, but the point is made. I helped him location scout for a few of his other films. And we are still friends. I feel so blessed to have had such an incredible friend, kind and gentle; a good human being who taught me so much about the business in my young life. And he let me teach him. About blues music, women’s literature and the Oregon Spirit, which he very much admires. But for the next 3 days after this initial encounter, I felt sick. I couldn’t eat or drink or sleep. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. Then on Valentine’s Day, February 14th 1975, I was in Bend with my then-husband Jay. One of his older and wiser friends over there told me I was probably in love. I can say that he was right, it was love, but it was a deep love for the whole film of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and all of its moving parts: Michael, Jack, Milos, the 100-year-old building, the story, it’s author, and being a part of its history being made. By writing this book, I am finally figuring it all out. That the author, screenplay writer, director, cast and crew I came to know and love that day were Poetic Cinema Filmmakers, like me. Or who I always wanted to be. I can pick them out of a crowd or even getting off a plane. As a casting director, I became a professional observer of people.

For instance: This photograph is of Bo Goldman (one of the screenplay writers) and Michael Douglas on the set. Bo and Michael’s shoes are worn. Indians like that. If you wear new shoes to meet Elder American Indians, they aren’t going to trust you. I love Bo’s patched pants and Michael’s Pendleton shirt. They were our kind of people. Milos was so comfortable to be around. (Unless he had the flu. Then he was a bear.) Michael Douglas called it his “Middle European Sensibilities”; I called it his poetic-ness. Others may call it Czech Wave meets New Hollywood. Or even German New Wave, French Neuvelle Vague, etc. It’s all “Poetic Cinema.” Here are some rather poetic quotes from Milos that support my earlier supposition: “Miloš Forman’s Filmmakers Newsletter interview from December 1975, in which he talks about the origins of the One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest project, the complicated process of casting and why Nicholson was chosen for the lead role and, perhaps most interestingly, discusses his filmmaking preferences and technique in depth.” MILOSFORMAN:Iwasgettinga lotof offers,scriptsand books,and CUCkOO’S NESTwasby farthemost intelligent,interesting piece to come across my desk. Therewerea lot of things,from details to the overall philosophy ofthe book,that appealed to me tremendously.I have always liked stories which deal with individuals in conflict,against the so-called establishment.I’m touched by these kinds of stories.It’s sort ofaCzech film,a Czech book. Every cameraman has a tendency to do his best, to give you the most perfect framing and the most perfect light possible. But perfection in this area can go against you and consequently against the actors. You must meet somewhere in between: you have to compromise-and he has to compromise. And for this you need a partner. You can’t make a compromise with a computer or someone who doesn’t understand what you are talking about. So it is very important for me to work with a man who has his own head, his own eyes and his own feelings, but who also has an open mind. I know pretty well before I start shooting where I want what kind of music— even if not exactly. So I choose the music before the scene is made. First, we play the music and then the camera starts rolling; but before the first word, the music stops. The reason for this is so that people will have the rhythm in their blood as they go through the whole take.” Larry Sturhahn", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:50:2f062d600fca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 870, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "feelings, but who also has an open mind.

The reason for this is so that people will have the rhythm in their blood as they go through the whole take.” Larry Sturhahn to Milos: “You see it just as it was shot? Then part of your directorial concept is following the film to its ending: you help create the music, you create the scenes, etc. They are your films and you are the prime mover.” Milos Forman: “They have from me whatever I am able to give. That’s the magic of film. You’re always getting things you didn’t anticipate—and sometimes something marvelous.” “Much of the cinematography inside the hospital is overtly mechanical and static. The group therapy meetings, perfect places for pans between characters, are made up almost entirely of medium shots, the community seen on the fishing boat disassembled. Here, there is only isolation. When Louise Fletcher’s Nurse Ratched enters the film for the first time, she walks silently through the cream-colored walls toward a motionless camera, giving off an air of order and rigidity without saying a word.” Revisiting it, Cuckoo’s Nest does look rather dull, but there is a definite contrast between the listless greys of the hospital and the brief interlude of colorful freedom, in which the patients, wearing bright orange life-jackets, board a fishing boat, and Candy (Mews Small) is introduced, all smiles, in her red top to the patients’ reverent approval. When Christopher Lloyd’s Taber starts to reel in a fish, Mc-Murphy ( Jack Nicholson) and the others are all in frame, backing him, a sense of community working toward a common, simple goal.” Therefore, Milos was like my Poetic filmmaker friends. He was the “Auteur’ as writer, director, casting director, music supervisor, cinematographer and editor. He started learning all these things out of necessity due to budget restraints and in return was given the talent to use these skills in a holistic way. But he was open to collaboration. But here in America, where there are no moral rights in the gestalt of capitalism, it all worked against him in the department of creative control. Used to collaboration, to brain storming and contributing creatively, we have our hearts broken when the world gets a lawyer who knows that whoever has paid for it has copyright possession and possession is nine-tenth’s of the law.

His sense of humour put everyone at ease, which is always a great asset on a set. He helped the people around him because he knew that the better their performances were, the better he would look in the end. But I was. And I don’t even know how it happened; but I was suddenly called into the Governor’s Office to report what was happening on the set. And it was not by Warren Merrill, but by Ken Fobes, who was previously an administrator to Governor Tom McCall and now Governor Bob Straub’s Administrative Assistant and Press Secretary. “Governor Straub had heard from the production folks on “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” that there had been an issue with the Oregon Film Commissioner who was representing the State in providing services and support to the film crew. The Governor said Mr. Merrill had accused Jack Nicholson of doing something that he denied, which resulted in Mr. Merrill being denied future access to the film producers and visits to the filming locations. Governor Straub then asked me to contact a Katherine Wilson, who was the Film Producers’ choice to replace Mr. Merrill in dealing with State support issues. Governor Straub asked me to set a meeting with Ms. Wilson as soon as possible to determine Ms. Wilson’s qualifications and provide him with a recommended action. On February 26, 1975, I met with Ms. Wilson in the Oregon Capital Building. It was clear to me, that Ms. Wilson was well qualified to provide State liaison services and support for the “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest” producers and she had their 100 percent confidence and acceptance. I then sent Governor Straub my recommendation.” I wore a turquoise Navajo bracelet from a friend in the Southwest, and Will Sampson came over to admire it. I returned the favor by admiring him.

There were a lot of journalists there that day. Including Tim Cahill from Rolling Stone. We didn’t know each other at all, but when he needed to interview Jack for a Rolling Stone article (after he was back in LA); my friend Bryn, who worked there, called me and I got ahold of Jack to set it up. The article is so well written I wanted to share it with you, so it is waiting for you at the Katherine Wilson Special Collection in the Knight Library @ the U of O. Then, on March 1, 1977, Michael calls, and I’m invited back. So once again, while I am in Salem, I set up a meeting with Ken Fobes. It’s for March 6.th But this time I don’t go to the set, Michael meets me at his house because he wanted me to take him shopping for record albums and Fred Meyer sold them right down the street. He drove an old Toyota hatchback with a big dent in the rear. I thought either he was too broke from producing his movie, or too busy to get it fixed. We talked about how things were going on the set. But I never asked personal questions except, “Where you from?” and he told me. Westford, Connecticut. He talked about his Mom. We bought the new Average White band, Robert Palmer and the new Al Green. He was a fan of Jazz, so I recommended Stanley Turrentine’s Pieces of Dreams; but they didn’t have that one. (The irony is, I think Michael met Saul Zaentz through Fantasy Records in Berkeley. Fantasy Records is a Jazz-based distributor. Stanley Turrentine was with Fantasy Records. We always got our records for our record store from these distributors in Berkley.) Then within days Jack Nicholson called, inviting me to a party at his place on the Ides of March. I found out later that Michael and Milos had dinner with the Oregon Governor that night with their respective girlfriends Brenda Vaccaro and Aurore Clement. And I found out later I was an item of discussion. But he just took them for a walk, to not make a scene in front of us, and then they came back.

But Jack had great music, and I remember he played JJ Cales’ new album for us. The action begins in the Superintendent office and then sprawls out into the hallway, where we were sitting behind the cameras. Jack was like a loaded spring. What I remember is that there were only three takes. The third one was so over-the-top with emotion and physicality that Louise had to break character: “Jesus Jack! You’re killing me!” It wasn’t an exaggeration; she stayed on the floor while the medics checked her out and iced the red welts on her throat. I was impressed. There was a break and I took five. I remember the facility was in pretty rough shape. The bathroom had the most awful color of green in it. As I looked in the mirror I realized that in the green reflected light of the mirror, I looked kind of good in it. It’s now my favorite color. Institutional green. But something huge had happened the day I flew down. KSAN and FM founder Tom Donohue had suddenly died from a heart attack, and it seemed like everyone was in the throes of grief. Bryn had to help with his wake, so I went to the set by myself. She told me it was just as well, she couldn’t even get me on the list, because it was strictly for Tom’s inner circle. Evidently, Jim Marshall was close friends with Michael, and had shown Michael the contact sheets from the Wake, and there I was. Michael had been living in LA, and was just now in San Fran to shoot one sequence for Streets. I even got to be there when Detective Steve Keller died, because Michael had a successful film in the can and wasn’t going back to TV, and so had left the series. They filmed alternative endings, and this one wasn’t chosen. But it was fast friends at first sight. That seemed to be what happened between photographers and me, especially motion picture ones. But I never let (knowingly) anyone photograph Michael and I together, because I was sensitive to what the Paparazzi would make of it and then would, in turn, do harm to our spouses.

We were on the third floor, and suddenly, as he was shooting, the window went dark with smoke and the fire alarms went off. He didn’t care, he liked the light. Good thing it was just a grease fire in the kitchen, or I wouldn’t be here to write this book. We then flew to LA and Michael introduced me to his assistant, Jack, who had picked us all up. Jack and I later helped Michael look for some property in the Wallowas with my brother- in-law Jim Wilson and Spyglass Development. But then Michael was engaged to some Aspen Real Estate Heiress named Nancy, and that fell through. There was also some noise coming from the Mental Health Experts be-crying the EST scene, but the esteemed mental-health expert Dr. Dean Brooks was the filmmakers’ formidable advocate, and sided with them. What the world didn’t know was he had stumbled upon an early rehearsal a year before, where the actors were implementing some misguided ideas. And in no uncertain terms he let the filmmakers have it. So, they knew they could count on him to be upfront about things. Just when I thought it wasn’t going to fly, I got the call at the last minute to drive in the pouring down rain to the Portland Premiere at the Bagdad on Hawthorne in Portland. By the time I arrived at the venue, my hair was drenched and my long black silk skirt was wet and wrinkled. But suddenly there was Michael, handing me a glass of champagne and seating me next to Governor McCall and his wife Audrey. He whispered he couldn’t stand to watch it even one more time, and to come to The Benson Hotel after-party when it was over. Not only did I get to sit next to the Governor, who was one of my life’s hero, but I also got to talk to him, and he was clearly having a wonderful time. When his newscast came on the screen, as if waiting for his cue, he talked out loud to his performance. The audience chuckled. And then later we all cried at the end. Just from the enormity of it all. Evidently Michael trusted me with the most important person in the room. It just occurred to me that that was how I got the job. Later that night, after the Benson, I stayed with my best friend from High School, Mary Gilbert, who was enrolled in the Medical School at OHSU up the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:55:19224947f7d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 875, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "cue, he talked out loud to his performance.

It just occurred to me that that was how I got the job. Later that night, after the Benson, I stayed with my best friend from High School, Mary Gilbert, who was enrolled in the Medical School at OHSU up the hill; and in the morning, I joined Jack and Michael for a late room service breakfast at the Hotel. We then drove the 45 miles to Salem in the back of a Limo for another premiere. The boys were pretty fried. They’d been on a worldwide whirlwind, promoting the picture for 9 months, and all the stress that entailed showed. When they were here before, they didn’t seem to be so worried. But now they were. “Death.” Michael said. When it was money they worried about, they never thought about it. But now they were a huge success, and were afraid to even fly in airplanes. I told them every bad joke Hoyt Axton had told me, and made them laugh, which with all the groaning, soon revealed the culprit, severe hangovers. So, I dug in my purse for an emergency Darvon I had for migraines. It was only the one capsule. They both wanted it, so I carefully divided the grains in two and gave them each half. But I warned them to take it with water, because it was really bitter. There was no water in the Limo. I went, huh? Where’s the Champagne? The only other limo ride I ever had was stocked with booze. Jack immediately went into his usual m.o. of “bombs away” and had us in stitches with his histrionics. Laughter was the best medicine. And as we settled down in a drugged stupor (I already had mine earlier at breakfast) I held both of their hands and told them how honored I was to be there sitting between them. Jack raised an eyebrow and Michael just smiled. I felt like Katharine Ross in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Life was good. And then we arrived to a mob of people and I disappeared from the masses. We were all in the lobby, the inmates were seated in the theater, and the movie began.

The movie finally ended, and not a sound, not a clap came from behind the curtain. Minutes dragged by. Then a man quietly emerged from the theater. They had sent a spokesman. Milos was the first to recognize him. Milos gathered Michael and Jack around him. They were quiet like mice in a church. The spokesman then said they were so moved by the film they could not speak, and they asked him to speak for them. But that wasn’t all. For the first time ever, they felt like they weren’t cuckoo birds anymore, tethered to a cuckoo clock. They were human beings who had contributed to an art form, and had educated the world on the hell that they lived in. They had freed their brothers and sisters from the stigmatism of mental illness, and that God would reward the filmmakers and Dr. Dean Brooks for giving them a chance, and by hiring some of them on the movie. To add insult to injury, the Academy Awards on March 29^(th) , 1975, (two days later) was one for the world record books. From Wikipedia: “ Miloš Forman’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest made a “clean sweep” of the major Oscar categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adapted). It was the second … flm(s) to accomplish the sweep, following It Happened One Night in 1934. But that didn’t work out either, and so, as a consolation prize, they promised Kesey some profits off of the film. Michael said they had also paid him something like 10k or 50k, , I can’t remember which, to write that draft, plus 2.5% of the net. The rumor was that they came to an agreement for the profits written on a napkin: When the bananas are ripe, the banana boat will come in’. As I understood it, Michael and Saul felt that the points were a gift in addition to the payment for a screenplay they didn’t use. Kirk Douglas had paid Ken in full for the film rights. The film premiered on November 19^(th). , grossing less than $100, 000 that weekend, and even though it was a hit, Ken probably didn’t know that back then, on an Independent Production like Cuckoo, the distributor gets all their money back first. Sometimes that is even more than the budget of the film for the Prints and Ads. After that, from what I understand, the Film Financier (like Saul) gets his money back, and even then, he usually has to split the profits after “break-even” with the distributor.

So, when does the deferred Actor, like Jack Nicholson, or the Producer like Michael Douglas get paid? Let’s just say that Michael may have been driving a dented-in Toyota Hatchback for a reason during production. The napkin probably didn’t include all that. But it went to the lawyers. And Michael went to Cannes, and I went into the Casting Director Business. After seeing a sign in Salem on a telephone pole as a call for extras on Cuckoo’s Nest that said: “Do you have a face that scares Timber Wolves?” posted by Mel Lambert, a used car salesman (who did find Will Sampson!) I saw a need. And I had already been casting my friends in a few commercials. But when Dennis Hopper announced through Film columnist Pierre Dunn at the Willamette Valley Observer that he was making Trask and needed extras, I saw my chance. Pierre gathered the resumes for Dennis, and when the film fell through, he gave them to me. And since Cuckoo I had some crew street cred. I wasn’t just a pretty face anymore. Even Warren Merrill seemed to treat me better, and on July 30th called about a film going into Brownsville, Oregon called Flood. I hung with the location scout for a while there, and then again in LA, but they already had an LA casting wrangler. We brought in $16, 000 dollars in location and talent fees, and then for the whole next year the residual payments were extravagant. Amy Higgins, the little girl, above, made $20, 000 alone in residuals. And there were other perks, Kesey’s Grandmother Ophelia was now in Screen Actors Guild and was covered by Blue Cross Insurance, for her role in the commercial. We shot 27 vignettes in two weeks, which is the equivalent of half a motion picture. And we provided it all: locations, casting, make-up, hair, wardrobe, gaffers, grips, sound and lights. The only thing from LA was the director Bob and his wife Daphne Green, who would later take me sailing when I went down there. We had lunch after the scout with Dr. Dean Brooks and his daughter Kathy at his house, and it was like old times in the ward. We actually WENT to Ward 9, and Ward 84, too, after lunch, and Michael brought presents for these women in homicidal lock downs.

She had ordered a lobster, and the waiter brought it to her, live, to approve. It pinched her on the breast. We left laughing about karma, and then in return got blasted as we left the restaurant by the flash bulbs of the paparazzi, that we were sure Rona had called from the little phone booth in the back. When we found all the locations in just a few hours, even filming a pan shot (with one of the Prankster 16mm cameras) of Fraternity row with the old beat up house on it, Peter MacGregor-Scott asked what made us think the University would let us film there. I said, “What? Are you kidding me? This is the home of the Merry Pranksters!” • “You (bleeped) up, you trusted us.” (Never trust a Prankster) • The “Universe in a thumbnail” scene • A Road Trip • Pranks: “Who delivered cadavers to the school alumni dinner, put underwear in the trees and flushed cherry bombs down the toilet?” • The Toga Party in lieu of an “Acid Trip”; (because this was 1962) • And my favorite, taking an old bus and painting it, and taking an old Lincoln and painting it • Not to mention sex, drugs and especially rock and roll Eugene was full of creative artists, actors and crazy-for-film extras. I cast 20-some speaking roles and 1400 extras. And just like the poetic cinema days, we all did whatever it took: I was a locations scout, casting director, extras wrangler, stuntwoman and an actress in a scene with Tim Matheson that got cut from the movie, but ended up in the trailer. I was also a huge fan of Donald Sutherland’s. When Landis found out, he made sure to introduce me. It was the day Landis orchestrated a Press day with Donald. And I am pretty sure it was Thanksgiving week, a Fri-Day. Donald was working on Invasion of the Body Snatchers in the Bay area, and could only shoot then. Why else would I have to get 27 turkeys for the crew? Anyway, we were at Katie’s House, a very tiny place. And Landis introduced me to the Donald. But he brushed me off. Later, Landis asked me how it went. I said, “O.K.” Landis said “OK?

NOW BE NICE.” I explained: “I have an art house called Cinema 7.” “Oh,” he said, .”… uh, what was your favorite scene?” I went into this long, detailed description of his soliloquy on a boat about Death while the sun set. He turned white as a sheet. “How did you ever know we shot that scene on the boat? That reel of film fell overboard, and was lost. We had to reshoot it on the beach instead!” I just looked at him and shrugged, and walked away. The best part was Belushi. One night we took him to the Eugene Hotel to see The Nighthawks with the Robert Cray Band. I had cast Robert as a Knight in the Otis Day scenes. And so right after filming the Toga Party Belushi was hot-to-trot down there to see him play in the splinter group The Crayhawks. But just like in William Butler Yeats’ Gyre theory, a small event, during the filming of Animal House, which was in October of 1977; defined the next year and my future in a million ways that I had never expected. It was a movie premiere for my Dad’s old friend James Ivory, and for his film Roseland in New York. And then another one in Portland. It turned out the Producers were from Oregon, the Murphy Brothers, who not only had funded the production of $375, 000 ; but were also hosting another premiere for James Ivory in Oregon on January 24th. They said Ivory was another “Oregon Timber Baron’s son” and were proud of his work. I was invited to the Premiere, and attended with Lucretia, my friend who went with me in 1973 to be in Cinderella Liberty. It was truly a wild 70’s Oregon Irish Party that went into the wee hours with way too much champagne and Irish whiskey chasers. I was supposed to call Jack that night when I got in, but every single time I ever flew into LA; I would get a migraine. I thought it was the stress of this Oregon country girl flying into the midst of 8 Million people, but later I found out I got them every time I would fly into Telluride, Colorado, too,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:60:45087b5e519d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 880, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "Oregon Irish Party that went into the wee hours with way too much champagne and Irish whiskey chasers.

And the next morning I called him. “Jack,” I said, “there are bullet holes in the walls of this hotel room.” A big sigh. “Well, I told you to call me when you got in, you could have stayed here.” That was true, but I am very particular about having space. With no one next to me all the time. So this time I sighed, and told him I’d see him at 2. He answered the door wearing a bathrobe, with his hair on end. It was a modest 2- bedroom ranch house on Mulholland, with a killer view. Michael Murphy stood by the panoramic window and tried to talk basketball shop with Jack. I sat on a stool, while Jack was seated at his dining room table. It probably wasn’t a good idea to mention the fact that the Portland Trailblazers had won the previous championship from the Lakers. By now I had insisted I move to the Hyatt on Sunset, my home away from home, and he dropped me off. It had started to rain, and heavily. So I changed clothes from business to casual, into my signature black leather classic boots, my favorite worn to a frazzle blue jeans and a beautiful black Pendleton wool sweater. But the Maitre’d to the Polo Lounge would not let me in, as I wasn’t dressed properly. I said, “So you don’t remember me here a couple of hours ago in a business suit? I just lost my phone book is all, and I’m late for dinner with Jack Nicholson because I don’t have his address!” They didn’t believe me. Finally, a doctor felt sorry for me and walked me in on his arm. They smiled politely and brought me my address book. When I finally went out front to get my cab, he was gone. The new cab heard the address and balked. He said he was afraid of mudslides up on Mulholland. I had to promise him an extra $20 to just take me as far as he could, and then I would walk the rest of the way. He told me that I was crazy to walk in LA.

With the Ennio Morricone soundtrack of course. Then Bernardo directed his own very long 1900, which was my favorite movie of all time for a long time. Meanwhile, back at the ranch (literally) word got out I had set up a meeting with Jack Nicholson for an Oregon Screenplay. And my phone started ringing. It was a friend of ours, Jack Springer, who had a screenplay by Ernest Hemingway called Last Good Country. Hemingway had died while writing it, and Mary Hemingway gave him permission to finish it, a Nick Adams story. Springer had gone on from the Animal House fraternity @ the U of O to create an ad agency in New York City. He was very literate and had taken me to Kesey’s one of the first times I went. It was now March 5^(th) , and I was staying at Jack Nicholson’s house again, after Springer left for New York. He wanted to know more about Ray DeAutremont, and by then I had actually met the old man in my office, since I last saw Jack the month before. Michael Murphy had brought Ray DeAutremot to meet me, and I was still trying to figure out things regarding LaMonte Johnson as director.

And later that night James took us to a meeting with Hugh Hefner at his Mansion. I was playing pinball when ol’ Hef decided to talk to me. It did not go well. I was a 2^(nd) generation liberated woman and was not going to be patronized; so I flew back to San Francisco to meet Springer at the Huntington Hotel for a full report. I spent some time with Becky and Jim Marshall in Tiberon, and then I took them to meet my clan around Sausalito from the 60’s record store days. My friends had been in Haight-Ashbury and Union Square before ‘67, and had moved to the Issaquah, an old dance boat from Seattle on Gate 6 in the “Gates of Sausalito.” Jim had been living above Union Square for decades, so he knew them. Great fun. I had already brought The Divine Miss M album to Seattle in the spring of 1973, for Mark Rydell to hear her music, before us seeing her on Johnny Carson. I wanted him to be the one to discover her for his next film A Star is Born. (And Kris Kristofferson). But the film went into turnaround and Barbara Streisand picked it up; but at least she kept my suggestion of Kris Kristofferson. After the “Sneak Preview” for The Rose, we had dinner with Alan Ladd, Jr. at the Governor Hotel Dining room, and it was such an amazingly magical memory, that I kept returning to that place for “my office in Portland” for the next 30-some years. Can you guess why? Yep. The 50-foot-long mural of Lewis and Clark in the lobby., with Indian friends. It was after that, while waiting for the phone to ring, that Oregon Film Factory’s Bob Laird and I began the process of creating our own projects, and we decided to make a low budget ABC after-school special based on a true Oregon story called “Goat Hill;” which was about some goats near Roseburg that predicted the weather. I invited VIPs, U of O faculty and staff, Actors and Extras, Crew and Hullaballoo. I even pranked Landis with a cow coming out of the old house while he was being interviewed by newsmen on the steps.

Thinking I had done my job, and turning the extras over to my assistant, I went to LA with Bob Laird over Labor Day Weekend for meetings about our second ABC After School Special. But this time John Landis had set us up with Executives there. I was in my element and sold the show. What were these guys hoping for? They had been in Eugene just a few years before. I don’t think it was for money or fame that caused them to spend the intervening years of their life’s energies on writing, developing, casting, crewing, financing; then shooting, editing and marketing a Eugene-based story. I think it was to try to recreate the magic they experienced here of art, archetype, immortality, je ne sais quois that had been born here with that Poetic Cinema/ Oregon Literary Cinematic Voice, from Kesey’s Cuckoo and Sometimes to Rafelson’s Five Easy Pieces, to Nicholson’s Drive He Said to Richard Rush’s Anti-heroic Getting Straight. I just had my first baby, Patrick, in April of 1980, and there had been no work now for quite some time. My rent was past due at the office, but Michael Douglas had sent me a check as a present for my impending motherhood, with an admonition that babies were the best productions we could ever create, not companies. I had some people help out at the office, one of them allegedly going to buy me out. Which is why I had been hanging in there for the last 9 months. But the minute I signed a contract with Warner Bros.’ Production manager Bill Young for 10% of all extras fees that I cast for bleacher crowd scenes, I suddenly had this guy as a buyer. Hell, I even took him to the bank my brother-in-law was the manager of, to co-sign him and get him a bridge-gap loan to keep the doors open, based on that contract. But then he was in arrears. Next thing I know my office is broken into, things are stolen and rifled through, and I figured it out. It was my assistant looking for my contract with Warners. Thank God it was safe in the bank’s vault. I called my brother in law and paid off the loan over the phone while that very assistant was rushing to the same bank with his scary looking drug-dealer friend to pay it off first.

The next day, when I returned from signing the payoff at the bank, the lock to my office was being changed. By two people I had started in the business and now were also working on set. They listened to me as I told them the truth, and left without changing the locks. They even came back later to apologize. The film soon wrapped, but they had to come back a month later and reshoot it with a whole new crew. They brought someone else in to finish the extras job. A guy from the U of O. Luckily, I had a solid relationship with the Provost’s Office and a lot of the people I had cast in roles on the film, like Wendy Ray, the track announcer, Andrew Traister and Al Mauro, who were kept on. Later I paid all the bills I had incurred getting talent to the set, including the two set PA’s and then split the profits with my assistant, out of nothing more than being someone who always kept my word. And sold him my business. Making movies is not all peaches and cream. It can get downright awful. And so, by the way, was the movie, in the end. Because what goes on on the set, shows up on the screen. The guys who bought my business went belly-up. But during the next year, 1981, was one of the good ones: Cry For The Strangers. It started with a phone call from a Casting Director named Barbara Claman. Barbara was looking for some real theatrical actors, and I had them. So, she flew up and I had the casting call catered and a limo to pick her up. Barbara and I also became friends, and we worked together on and off for the next 25 years. On Cry for the Strangers, I had found a young actor to star opposite Brian Keith in the film. He was the son of local theater diva Kathy Neal and Grandson of theatrical matriarch Melina Neal. His acting impressed her. She encouraged me to put an ad out in the trades for him: And Patrick Duffy would borrow “Patrick Jr.” whenever he got a chance to play with him.

The SAG strike was resolved in the fall of 1980, but its repercussions were still being felt by the industry, too. Add to that one of the biggest recessions in history since 1974, due to the Energy Crisis. In Portland, people like Tom Moyer and Don Gronquist were making their own films, with some success. There was also a blacklist, by the studios, of states that had anti blind-bidding laws. We were one of them. We were also an anti-right-to-work state, which essentially meant we were pro Union. So, non-union movies were vulnerable if the big Hollywood unions took issue with them, like AFL-CIO (Teamsters) SAG (Screen Actors Guild) or IATSE (International Affiliations of Theater and Stage Employees.) But back then, only SAG and the Teamsters flexed any muscle up in Oregon, so they got away with hiring for the rate offered to the rest of us.

I was just trying to build on that very real idea, especially when Forrest Soloman gave me 16 acres next to a lear jet landing (on 160 acres next to the Emerald Valley Golf Course, Restaurtant and Condos complex) near Creswell. Architect John Pratt and I formed a company to run a feasibility study. Alas, we could not find a “Master Leasor”; which was the ONE CRUCIAL requirement for our business plan, after researching other SUC-CESSFUL film studios. Oregon’s first Governor Appointed Motion Picture Task Force, summer of 1982 Left to Right: Dan Biggs, Producer (Portland); Lew Melson (Eugene); Curly Bob Lasciavo (Yoncalla). In front of him is Doug Carter, Governor Atiyeah’s Director of Economic Development, and the two people next to him are his staff. Behind them is Dave Simmonds (Grants Pass) myself (Eugene); and Mark (Ashland) who later formed the Southern Oregon Film & Video Association, with a man named Alan, I think from Medford, next to him.

There was also a woman in Portland named Marilyn Day, who was my equivalent in Eugene. She had a rolodex like mine, and we would share film contacts as well. She had some in Eugene, and I had some in Portland from the films I worked on there. This was a collaborative effort. Everyone pitched in with contacts. After 3 years of commuting to OMPA meetings, especially as a young mother, I was finding it hard for the Eugene group (and other cities) to meet the criteria for OMPA (Oregon Media PRODUCERS Association) which required professional credits; so, we formed Oregon Media PRO-DUCTION ARTS, to include people who were still getting on their feet professionally, or otherwise had a stake in our industry, like the architect working with me on Studio 503. Marilyn and I had also decided that in the days of no email or cheap cell phone calls it wasn’t feasible to have just one organization for all of Oregon.

She and I wrote many letters back and forth between long distance phone calls to help each other with laying the foundation for the Eugene charter, and then with Mark for the Southern Oregon organization together. The third recommendation the Task Force made was to hire the film commissioner from a job description we created. We felt someone from the industry itself, with their own connections and knowledge of how film works would be very important, and in addition, perhaps someone even with knowledge of film legalities would be ideal. If the purpose is not waived [by the client], the exemption is absolute; neither the preliminary language of ORS 192.500(2) nor paragraph (h) itself contains any language providing for a balancing test. If the lawyer-client privilege is applicable, the Attorney General cannot consider whether or not the information should be disclosed in the public interest, but must deny your petition. He did a great job in bringing Hollywood to Oregon for years, and was just starting to see the value of having an organized and experienced Oregon crew base, but the times were changing and it wasn’t about wining and dining anymore, like it was with Paul Newman and Lee Marvin, it was about the New Hollywood wanting resources that were younger and hipper filmmakers. In 1984, it occurred to me that this would put me out of the location scout business, but I knew it was best for the industry. Besides, I had just been called about a Dream Job, with a huge expense account from one of the World’s largest advertising agencies, Ogilvy and Mather. It was to find “real” people who could act on camera. By now the word was out that I was the who you were gonna’ call for that particular qualification. It was for Ernest and Julio Gallo, and it was top secret. I couldn’t even tell you what the product was. And they trusted me because I had done a few national commercials before for them. I was paid to drive around Oregon and find, in non-urban areas, real men who could talk on camera. I had a ball. I was in my element. I hope you don’t mind this image too much. It’s old and tattered, from surviving fires and floods and 34 years of moving around. But I love it just the same.

I had called the Bend Chamber of Commerce, and they put the whole casting call together. They were the ones who found him. No wonder a future Film Commissioner named David Woolson made the local Chambers’ his film liaisons. These guys were great. They did what I did for Hollywood. Everything that is needed. “Whatever it takes.” To sum it all up, here is an article on my vision for Oregon Film written by Jim McChesney for The Springfield News in February of 1982. I believe this article and the one at the beginning of the chapter caught the attention of Doug Carter at Gov. Atiyeah’s Economic Development, because he is quoted in the first, and the second outlines the greater vision. …Katherine Wilson, the “star” of our movie, is really no star at all. But her life could be amovie. She is the only person in Lane County who casts parts for local Hollywood productions. She has also cast for local TV advertisements. At 30, she sits in her office at 1712 Willamette St., the home of Associated Film Production Services, and talks about past experiences: the filming of “Animal House,” dinners with Jack Nicholson, good times with famous actors. It’s a life that could be made into a movie with scenes like this… …The theater is hushed as the screen fades to black. The curtain opens to hundreds of people standing, milling, waiting in front of a large, ancient, trashed-outhouse. Cameras on cranes, sound equipment, lighting gear and the technical clutter of othe rparaphernalia litter the yard in front of the house. As someone is heard calling for quiet on the set, the camera slowly closes on a woman, Katherine Wilson, standing alone across the street. Tall, thin, pretty, there is a tired smile on her face as she lights a cigarette, takes a relaxed drag and says aloud, “I did it. I put this whole thing together and it’s working. I did it.” The scene changes to Hollywood. The same woman is walking into a fancy restaurant accompanied by Michael Douglas, son of Kirk Douglas, a producer of such films as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and “China Syndrome.” A few heads turn.

Rona Barrett, of gossip column fame, seated at a near table, is presented by her waiter with a live lobster for inspection prior to cooking. To her horror, but the delight of our couple, the lobster’s claw and apart of Miss Barrett’s anatomy come into painful contact. There is a scream, and lots of laughter. The scene changes again. Wilson is riding in the back of a black limousine. She is flanked by Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas. They are both holding her hands and groaning from obvious hangovers. She is laughing, telling them as many bad jokes as possible, trying to keep their spirits up as they approach the Oregon State Mental Hospital for a screening of “OneFlew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” that they filmed there. Nicholson and Douglas are both worried. One scene, though, would show her in her office. It’s early morning, she is still sleepy ,smoking a cigarette, drinking tea from a Styrofoam cup and talking. She sits curled in a pink-stuffed chair, top siders on her feet, wearing light cords and a loose cotton jacket decorated with a goldstar; talking about all she has been and all she still wants to be a part of. The more she talks, the more she seems to waken. his film, shot in Brownsville, Oregon in 1985, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay from Stephen Kings’ novella The Body; the Japanese Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; and won the Jackie Coogan Youth Award for the cast of River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Jerry O’Connell and Corey Feld man. It has a cult following, still bringing visitors from all over the world In 2006, we had a reunion of sorts of the cast and crew who worked on it there, along with a “world famous pie eating contest,” a cruise in and a sock hop. Alamo Drafthouse helped put the showing of the film on, drive-in movie style. None of this would have ever happened without the indefatigable efforts of Linda Lewis McCormick from the Brownsville Chamber of Commerce. Another reason why David Woolson was so wise as to have them rep locally. Later I had to beg to be the Location Casting Director… even after casting Animal House. Turned out the UPM didn’t think there was any bona fide crew or any talent in Oregon, so my UPM from Animal House, Peter MacGregor-Scott called him and convinced him to take a chance on me.

I won, 12 times, including Andy Lindberg, the kid the Casting Directors in LA could not find for the role of Lardass. The Producer, Director and Writer/ Producers were so wonderful to work with, I swear it showed up on the screen. They even attended a wrap party for an early MOPAN event: “The Great Lane County Shoot-Out,” when we had about 100 people film every location in Lane County for the Oregon Film Office in one day. We had spent a lot of money the first 6 weeks of pre-production, under the banner of Embassy Productions. On the 1^(st) day of Principal, traditionally all the Producers, writers and stars get their checks. But Embassy JUST closed the deal to be sold to Columbia Pictures, which was then owned by Coca-Cola. But I heard a rumor, on set, that Oregon’s PERS had a 2% “wild card” fund for high-risk venture capital and funded Norman Lear’s “funding.” In 1985, Governor Atiyeah had just put a lot of effort into growing Oregon’s film industry. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had something to do with that “rumor” being true. t was another 3 long years until another out-of-state originated film job came to the Eugene Area. Heck, a long 3 years until ANY film came to Oregon! So, in the meantime, in 1986, we decided to make our own. And it happened because I finally had packaged an Oregon story with an actor that triggered financing. Sort of. What had started as a beautiful story about a young man coming of age, trying to deal with an outlaw family, became a bloody caricature of itself by the time this Producer got through with re-writing it, recasting it and re-editing it. It wasn’t an Oregon story anymore. It wasn’t even filmed here. It even became set in a “southern” town. But there were a few things I had done right, one was casting Chris Rydell, Mark’s son. And Tina Louise, Ruth Buzzi, Moses Gunn, and even John Vernon from Animal House. But I do have to give the producer credit for suggesting Karen Black. She was the shining STAR on this production. The rest of them were wonderful and professional. But she carried it.

Various old friends from Oregon who had day-player roles, or even above the line crew like Casting Director Barbara Claman, (who had mentored me in this, my first role as an Executive Casting Director) stayed there. So, I had a lot of support around me. My former assistants Mark Hughes, Charlene Tolles, and her Mom Edith, my other favorite old extra Leonard Quam, among others, were all staying there, one time or another. Recovering people are scared of painkillers because they can trigger your addiction again, and I was so scared. Finally, Philip said I had no choice, and they put the morphine needle in my knee. Then he promised he would make sure I only took my pain killers only as prescribed, by keeping them. He went on to support me in my work on the set, too. And we fell in love. When the film ran out of money (and it was clear there were no more skateboarders with cash coming) we, the crew, confiscated the last reel. And I turned the Producer into the Washington State Attorney General for leaving us all with his indebtedness to the talent, community, and to us, his crew. And he kept the reel as collateral. The new governor had appointed a new film commissioner for the State of Oregon, but I wasn’t hearing much of anything from that quarter. While I was gone MOPAN fell apart, and I let it. My heart was in Seattle with NWI’s John, Ginene and Charlie. I was raising money for them to keep the doors open, because Film Development was my true purpose in life. I thought. Later, I had traveled with them to LA, and put one of their films on a Casting Service called Breakdown. The film was called Temporary Insanity, and it was a hoot. It was about a temporary office placement service, and I remember putting the window washers, who were wild and crazy twins on Breakdown, listing one of them as a short Danny DeVito- like character, and the other one a very tall and thin guy. Sigh. The next thing I know Ivan Reitman was making Twins. And when I went up to Seattle the next summer, camping with my kids and working on packaging their other project, a time-travel romance called Now and Then with Bobby Weir (one of the Grateful Dead members;) I got a call from the new Oregon Film Commissioner, Marjie Lundell, who had tracked me down somehow, and needed me back in Oregon.

But there was a problem brewing, the U of O said “NO!” to the producers. So, they started looking at OSU on the Corvallis campus, but there was no local crew there. We were the only one-stop motion picture support shop I knew of. We provided locations, casting, and crew. And they were going to hire Philip as the first local transportation coordinator, the first I had yet heard of, in Oregon, too. Between the two of us we got the film decision reversed. It was ironic, 10 years earlier we had convinced the U of O President William Boyd to let Animal House film because Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were celebrated alumni. Now it took Philip’s drinking buddy at the Vet’s Club and the matronly Muriel Jackson from the U of O Administration Office, who had been the University’s point person on Animal House. Not exactly great Hollywood bona fides. But it worked where Hollywood bona fides didn’t. I mean, at the time, this was a James Brolin movie! Now it’s a Josh Brolin Movie! Every single location they used was on my first roll of film, so I started in on casting speaking roles. Because I had been working in Washington for the last two years, and not up to speed regarding the current talent in town, I hired my old high school drama teacher, Ed Ragozzino, to help me. They cast him immediately as the doctor. I also got my old friend, the Head of the English Department, Dr. Ed Cole, on as a track coach. And helped them crew up locally, including Jay Smith and a cast of thousands. And James Brolin liked Philip. Philips car was an old ragtop Impala that he had torched the top off of and made it into a convertible. With Ocelot fur on the dash. James Brolin wouldn’t ride in anything other than that to set. Philip’s rag-top-less 1974 Impala circa 1988 with Ocelot fur on the dash and a cow-skull But it really wasn’t funny, because on October 8^(th) , 1988, the day we cast 5000 people on Hayward field, for free; and Philip had coordinated two company moves with all the semis and honey-wagons and star trailers and even burger-shacks on wheels; his very close friend Pat Scofield finally could not handle his depression anymore and took his own life.

And, of course they didn’t. But they almost did when, a few days later I took time off to go Cottage Grove to hold an old man named Leonard Quam as he died. For the last 10 years he was the adopted Grandpa for my kids. He was an extra in Animal House, whose wife died of cancer not long afterwards and left him all alone. Leonard was amazing. Don’t let anyone ever tell you that making a movie is more important than your people. We worked 100 hours a week on that show, not even breaking for lunch or coffee breaks. And we did such a great job that the Executive Producer sent Philip and I a big wedding present a couple of months later. Many years later, when Philip ran into Josh Brolin on a film in Portland, he immediately asked him to watch over his wife, Diane Lane, because he trusted him. There is something about working on a set that makes lifelong friends. For one thing, you have to work together long hours together, depending on each other, and trusting each other with your reputation, your career and even your life. It is the most collaborative thing I know of. Each department depends on the next to hold their end up, at high standards and at a relentless pace. The film is only as good as its weakest link, and everything that goes on behind the screen shows up bleeding through the screen. It’s an amazing thing. I love the photo below of crew members comforting each other. And knowing that recommending someone for a job and having them fail comes back on you, we had only brought the best on board. Like Mark Hughes on for locations. Kent Lutrell, who I cast as a stand-in for Jerry O’Connell in Stand By Me, and the actual body; came on board for Props. Several other locals were hired as well as crew. But the kid who rode his skateboard under a moving semi while wrapping the film at 3 in the morning as a joke? He was banned forever. ust as we thought things were getting better for us indigenous filmmakers under Governor Atiyeah, the new Governor in 1987 dropped the ball.

But the good news was, that underground, and without Hollywood fanfare, Portland Filmmakers of the 80’s were building more and more bona fide projects of their own. They built it on the backs of Pennie Allen, Don Gronquist, and especially on Will Vinton and Bob Gardner’s Closed Mondays, an animated short which won the 1974 Oscar for their groundbreaking clay animation project. And Portland was incubating its future film crew with Will Vinton; his wife, writer Susan Shadburne, and his partner in Millennium Pictures, Dan Biggs Productions. These first Oregon-made crew-members were Bob Schmaling, Bruce Lawson, Tom Arndt, Ben Hayden, E. Larry Day, Jeanne and Bo Medley, Sean Kennedy and even Gus Van Sant, with Eric Alan Edwards, Alex Rad, Marychris Mass, Tom Leitner, Heidi Sturdevant, and Billy Scream. Don Gronquist was also producing then. And Bill Simmonds, Russ Fast, Michele Mariana, Joel Morello (from South Eugene High) and others were honing their voice and acting chops on these independent productions of Will’s. That was what we had worked so hard to change. I can’t tell you how many trips to the State Capital we had made in the 70’s to talk to our legislators, or how many Rotary clubs we had spoken to, trying to break the mindset that film was a glamourous but frivolous occupation, essentially that it wasn’t a business, and we as film crew didn’t count when it came to bringing them here. Neither of these women were appointed by Neil Goldschmidt with the guidelines of the 1982 Motion Picture Task Force in mind, either. And inadvertently it caused us filmmakers financial problems. Let’s just say that was why Philip and I decided to move away from our home in Oregon to Bainbridge Island, Washington, a ferry ride away from Seattle. The writing was on the wall: very small budget productions in other Oregon cities were all that was available at the time. The real work was up North. In Seattle, where the Teamsters Union began. And where IATSE ruled, and you could make a living wage. Then I was offered work on every film project there, and chose the one with Warner Brothers called Dogfight (1990) with River Phoenix. It was a period piece, set in the Bay Area, and parts of Seattle looked like San Francisco. The story starts in ’63 but ends in 1967. Oregon film friends were on it too, like E Larry Day and David Bouche. We may have moved 300 miles away, but the ‘80’s film mentality had followed us.

I was hired because the director wanted photographer “Diane Arbus” types (deformed) as extras, and I was a forerunner in that department. She was a Sundance supported woman director, from winning the Grand Jury Prize the year before for True Love. Before that she was an assistant auditor. But she fired her 1^(st) AD right before filming. The one I had spent weeks working with in pre- production. Prior to this, when I was also offered the TV series NORTHERN EXPOSURE, I went to interviews with both of the first AD’s. They thought they were interviewing me, but I was interviewing them, too. And I had chosen CJ, on DOGFIGHT, who was a pro. After the terrible AD on FINISH LINE I just wasn’t going to work with a bad one again. It’s not worth it. 1^(st) AD’s are who I typically worked with the most on every film I’ve done as an Extras Casting Director. Then 6 weeks later I got fired too, because I told her that the upcoming scene (San Francisco in 1967) was calling for the era’s “beautiful people” in the script. At the time, they were the “Flower Children” of the Bay area and a lot of them came from wealthy families. The ones I knew were Chevron Heirs and Exxon Oil Heiresses. But it all worked out for the best. Ken Kesey had called, inviting me to a Publishing Convention regarding his screenplay. My children missed their Dad. Philip’s elderly mom had been in a terrible car wreak and was being sued. We needed to return home to Oregon. And so, we did. I was glad. And of course, Dogfight bombed, because of what was going on behind the screen. By mid-summer we had sub-leased our home on the Island and were living in Philip’s Mom’s attic apartment, taking care of her. Then school started and the kids went to live with their dad while we restored a house on the McKenzie River. I had spent time with the Northwest Indies gang while up there on Puget Sound, and packaged yet another film, this time with Peter Reigert from Animal House. Jason Zelin, the Entertainment Attorney in LA (who thought that was a brilliant choice) and was putting together 35 MM in funding for a slate of films, including theirs. He needed one more.

And I thought of Kesey’s screenplay Last Go ‘Round, a true Oregon story brought to him by my Prankster friend Mike Hagen, who grew up in Pendleton, and whose family was very involved in the annual Pendleton Round-Up. Mike and his partner Michelle McMindes had paid Ken to write the screenplay, but essentially had the same kind of agreement that Cuckoo’s Nest had with him. Back then, people did deals with handshakes. Hagen used to say that for men, sex was a handshake, but for women it was a 30-page contract. That is what was needed, though. A 30-page contract. Even if Hagen was one of Kesey’s best friends. Everybody needed to be on the same bus. Kesey’s bus. And I did everything in my power to make that happen. But soon after, the investor that Jason was working with died in the shower, while the 35 MM was being traunched to the bank, and the investor’s widow reclaimed it. And Jason and I spent the next 4 years of our lives trying to make it up to Ken. In development hell. With Hoyt Axton. Which made it a lot more fun, because now I had a cowboy who Ken loved and could wrestle. So what made me think I could produce a film myself? Well, besides James Ivory from K. Falls, the age of my Dad inspiring me, there were a lot of Oregon crew producing too! Even before Deafula (made in 1974) Portland’s own Theater Mogul Tom Moyer, Jr. had made Modern Day Oregon’s first Independent film in 1972. Called The Circle, it celebrated a hit song of the same name by the New Seekers. It was poetic, existential, subversive and well, Oregon. Don Gronquist also made two other films in the 80’s, Rock-A-Day Ritchie and the Queen Of The Hop aka Stark Raving Mad (made in 1980) starring local actor Russ Fast, and Unhinged in 1982. I think they made more money with Horror. And Stark was noted in IMDBPro’s Trivia section: “Nearly every single person involved with the film were locals from the Portland, Oregon area.” Will Vinton was Tom Moyer’s Cinematographer on The Circle, even though Will is primarily known now as an Academy Award winning animator.

In the meantime, the Portland Producer who had financed James Ivory’s Roseland and had sent me to Jack Nicholson’s house, Michael Timothy Murphy, also made a film in 1980 called St. Helens, mostly in Oregon. With Portland documentary filmmaker Don Zavin’s footage of the mountain blowing up, and also had some Hollywood stars including Art Carney. It was the Wee Sing videos, the first one being Wee Sing Together (1985) that were the first to hire “long-time” Oregon crew members Bob Schmaling and E. Larry Day. And then when Susan Shadburne and Will Vinton started making the rest of the series, they went on to hire Dan Biggs (my future partner in Hoyt Axton’s animation project Happy Song); who by now was Producing. That’s when they really started hiring local crew, which might have been because of Dan’s being a fellow Governor’s Task Force Member, and/or on the board of the Seattle Film and Television Conference, where I had been discovered 13 years before for Cinderella Liberty. Cole’s Party, now with Don Gronquist involved, that hired Melissa Stewart as a Production Manager. Missy, as she went by after that, went on to become a great Production Designer for huge Hollywood Films. But that film also hired a soon-to-be-special someone for the “slate” job; arguably the most locally famous of our Oregon Film notables, Gus Vant Sant; as well as his close friend and cameraman Eric Allan Edwards, and one of my favorite screenplay writers, Alex Rad. But they were all very low budget productions. So it payed, but it really didn’t pay very well. Then, in 1988, another Biggs/ Shadburne/ Vinton Wee Sing Production, Grandpa’s Magical Toys, was released. And not only did it have E. Larry Day, Missy Stewart, Alex Rad and Bob Schmaling on board, but some new crew members: Bruce Lawson, Wes Houle and Sean Kennedy, who would go on to work in Oregon Film for the next 30 years. My cousin Kristin Jager from Eugene was hired on it, too. We just lost Kristin this summer. I wish she could have lived to see her name and photo here in my book.

For she and her brother Gary and her father, my Uncle Ed, were devoted artists, and may they all Rest in Peace, knowing they had inspired me to never quit, no matter what. Initially, this was important to me because it indicates another person was willing to either move or travel from Eugene to Portland or Hollywood or New York to work on their art, or on films. (Or is that kind of behavior just typical of “pioneer stock”?) My husband Philip Krysl has chosen to commute, and has done that now for over 25 years. I started commuting by train in the early 70’s, when I did Set Design for McCann Erickson. My favorite one was for Pioneer Savings and Loan, when I recreated Whistler’s Mother’s painting, with a live woman rocking in the chair. So, I have been commuting for over 40 years. I figured it wasn’t any worse than commuting to LA on the 405 every day! But, Gus made another great film called My Own Private Idaho in 1990, with what was becoming his core Oregon crew of Eric Alan Edwards, Sean Fong, Missy Stewart, Sara Burton, Ken Erck, Benjamin Hayden, Don Campeau & Yvonne Couture, and adding Mark James, Marvin Sanders and Shawn Gavin to the payroll. Peter Roscoe, Korey Pollard, Michael Murphy, Kim Plant, Sharry Manning, Alice Blanchard, Maida Belove, Ernie Garrett, Bobby Miller, Bobby Steinbrecher, Steve Lambrecht, Charlie Milhaupt, Mike Hagen, Bob Laird, David Butkovitch, Dennis Cozzalio, John Freeman, Al Strobel, George Lauris, Priscilla Lauris, Sally Struthers, David Ogden Steirs, Sam Elliott, Howard Farling, Sean Axmaker, Don Cato, James Ivory, James Blue and Julia Anne Robinson just to name a few. But in 1989 and 90 it looked bleak indeed, when Philip and I joined them. That is, until 1991, when David Woolson became our new Executive Director to a new revamped Film Office. Then it changed overnight. And most of those who left Oregon came back, like Philip and me. It’s good to note that by now ALL of our task force recommendations were taken seriously, even by other succeeding Governors, almost 10 years later. Early in 1991, Kesey’s LAST GO ‘ROUND project brought me to the office of Karen Runkel, the last acting “film commissioner” of Oregon.

It was her who brought us the first in a long line of incredi-ble Oregon Film Executive Directors, beginning with David Woolson. And which Oregon had never seen, up until then. And he was exactly what the task force wanted. And he started by walking us through a series of small budget productions which were low- hanging fruit, and then got us the one big film that really first brought OREGON Film (Portland Area, McKenzie River and Eugene Area filmmakers) together, for the first time- and they have been the core group of filmmakers ever since. That film was Disney’s Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Shot in Portland and the Wallowa Mountains. The Alpine Mountains of America. What an incredible place to bond. Crew members from the early 70’s and 80’s independent Oregon films were being hired: from Deafula (1974) in Portland, some crew went to Animal House (1977) and some of that Eugene crew went to Portlander Michael Murphy’s St. Helens (1980); as well as some of the crew from Don Gronquist, Will Vinton and Susan Shadburne’s crews, from the late 70’s through the 80’s, to Gus Van Sant’s Drugstore Cowboy, (1989) including Dan Self, Missy Stewart and Eric Allen Edwards. Gus had his start with Activist Filmmaker Penny Allen, on Property (1979) with Walt Curtis, and then Gus made Mala Noche (1986) from Walt’s book of the same name. Penny, born in Portland, was the SECOND Filmmaker to make a film with Hollywood stars, called Paydirt (1981). But it was Disney’s film that brought the core of Oregon’s remaining future crew together: Charlie Carlson, Ken Erck, Sean Fong, Greg McMickle; my assistant, Mark Hughes, (now as the Location Manager) and my husband Philip Krysl, Wanda Mull from Dixie Lanes, Monica Powell – Garris, and for the first time all 3 of the Lawson Brothers: Bruce, Brian and Brent. Philip was hired on this because of Susan Grant, who was now my literary agent in LA. She was friends with the Producer, Frank Levy, and also Jeffrey Chernov. She knew that for me to continue with development, Philip would need to work. He was already experienced by then on several films, but this was the big step up to a Major Motion Picture. We are eternally grateful to her for this. And for all she did for Last Go ‘Round and on my next project in development, Blanket of The Sun.

And for all she did for Last Go ‘Round and on my next project in development, Blanket of The Sun. To make a very long story short, in the process, I got the equivalent of a Harvard education in film producing with Susan, and Jason Zelin, a wonderful entertainment attorney. I learned how not to take a meeting, how to take a meeting, and budgets. I learned day-out-of-days-boards, from Hoyt’s son Mark, who I had once helped get on Dixie Lanes. I learned distribution. I learned packaging on a really high-end level with a director attached, but most of all I learned Screenplay & Story & Structure. But what I got in return was immeasurable. And that was the story of my true heritage, my identity and ultimately my life’s gift and purpose. In researching the story, Blanket of the Sun, I found my long, lost people of the Wallowa Band of the Nez Perce because of one of the protagonists, Jackson Sundown., who is both stories. When things weren’t going well for the Kesey project, my old partner in that project, Hoyt Axton, told me that BLANKET was a better story. Hoyt and I both had Grandmothers who were born in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma, and both kept it a secret about their heritage, because they were in the no-man’s land of mixed blood. My Grandmother would never have been the Treasurer of Klamath County had anyone known. I found this out at a family reunion years after I gave up my homes for funds to continue development. And Blanket of The Sun gave me my best friend, Etta Conner (a royal princess from Joseph’s brother, Alikut’s lineage) who had worked on several Jeff Chandler films in the Northeastern part of Oregon as a young girl. Her father was a member of Screen Actors Guild, and may have been Oregon’s first extras coordinator in the 50’s. Etta was my Indian guide into the heart of Nez Perce Indian country. We traveled 10,000 miles together researching the screenplay and traveling to LA to take meetings. She gave me my Indian name, Red Tail Hawk, and that gave me the other Nez Perce women who adopted me, and so many other friends in the Wallowas. It gave me my spirituality, that I could never find in a church. It made sense of all of my proclivities since childhood, like shoes and eyeglasses not fitting, fear of airless rooms, and it gave me the courage to write and produce screenplays.

I lost her in 2016 to cancer. Last Go ‘Round was set in Pendleton, BLANKET was about Chief Joseph’s nephew from his Wallowa Band of the Nez Perce. We think our protagonist was born in the same cave as Joseph was, there. I had registered my screenplay outline in January of 1992 with Writer’s Guild before I even knew where Jackson Sundown (Blanket of the Sun) was from. But I knew he rode What is even stranger, is that the summer before, when I was in Pendleton with Philip and my kids for the Pendleton Round-up, the Nez Perce were there and had just held their first Elders “gathering ceremony” to call their people home. (So many of them had been lost since the war, like my Grandmother’s people in the Prison Territory of Oklahoma.) And when they called them, it wasn’t over the telephone. It was my first time there ever.

But after working back to back on these productions, he turned down Praying Mantis when he was offered Transpo Captain on a 20^(th) Century Fox Film called Danger Sign, aka Hear No Evil. I just now remembered we had a bumper sticker then that said, “Kill Your Television.” So, he was happy to work back on film. Bob Rolsky had been a really great UPM for cutting costs, but he crossed the line when Philip asked him for bottled water. Craft Service had sugar-laden drinks, but nothing without it. Rolsky told Philip to go drink out of a hose. Now THAT is a really low budget film. Thank God in Oregon you CAN drink out of a hose. But Philip, like me, had started in the 70’s on films that took care of their crew better. And we found another bumper sticker: “Television is Furniture, Film is Art.” Philip and I now kid that we started at the top and worked our way down to being a “hose- water” crew.

What this really was, however, was Oregon Film School 101. And we all got paid to be on these big learning curves. Ultimately, we should have been grateful. And we were, because these little TV films paid the bills on one level, and in the larger scheme of things created our Oregon crew base. It even helped some of us dream of telling our own stories on the big screen, like me. Then suddenly, in 1992, there was a record number (19) of real budget films, including Gus Van Sant’s Even Cowgirls Get The Blues, with HIS Crew: Eric Alan Edwards, Missy Stewart, Dan Self, Ken Erck and Sean Fong, along with Sara Burton. And he hired others who would also become the future core crew of Oregon: Bart Heimburger, Douglas Hiserodt. Marvin LaRoy Sanders and Eric Solmonson. He even hired some young people that I first helped put on Stand By Me (1985), Casa and Simon Babbs. No wonder I had met Gus through Ken Kesey. Later I had found some property we were thinking of building on, which is why I was living in a tent while the kids and our nanny Angela Armstrong were in the apartment next to me in downtown McKenzie Bridge. “Downtown” was essentially 3 buildings: a church, the McKenzie Bridge General store and gas station, and the matching building with four Apartments next door. My old friend Skip Cosper had suggested the property for us, across the road from his place, near there. It was 1993 and he was just hired on Return to Lonesome Dove in Montana as first AD. By now he had worked with Ed Zwick and Terrence Malik, and SO understood our need to return to working on films that were a little more literate than the Wilshire Court ones. We became a film colony of 3 on Horsecreek Road. And not only did Skip help get Philip hired on Return to Lonesome Dove; but our friend David Norris was hired too, both of them as Drivers. Even Philip’s cousin Mike Leep was hired as a Goose Wrangler. That’s right. A nasty job that is, and dangerous. One night she invited Philip and David Norris for dinner, and Philip mentioned my projects in development.

The next thing I knew I was on my way to Billings, Montana with Angela, my Nanny, two kids and enough camping gear for 2 weeks. My restored 1966 Mercury Comet (with the roof racks holding the coolers and camping gear) looked like the “Grapes of Wrath” mobile. The trip became great screenplay material. Because we were late getting into the Lolo campground, I let my son Patrick talk me into just renting a Tipi. In the middle of the night I awoke to the Tipi breathing like a bellows. I looked behind me to see a shadow of a 12-foot-tall “Freddy Krueger” with nine-inch nails pushing on the top of the Tipi. On the other side of the entrance I encountered a giant mama Grizzly Bear who was now down on all fours walking around the corner to greet me. When we were face to face, she walked away looking over her shoulder and seemed to smile as if to say, I can dig it, I’m a Mama too. I swear her shoulders looked like Boulders as she lumbered away. I didn’t stop shaking for days. When you work away from home on set, in another town or especially another state on location, you can’t be there for your family. And your family has to come to you. I was ok with that, but Philip wasn’t. And it was hard for him to have us on set and not be able to really be with us, because he was working. And he wasn’t happy when the photo below was taken, either, because he was supposed to be back on call driving a difficult older actress. But later, the Gods smiled on him and he was chosen instead to drive a 17-yearold actress named Reese Witherspoon, and that fact still makes us smile. I had gone to the American Film Market, and that is where I met my partner in the project for the last 26 years, Indian Bob Primeaux. Bob was a member of the Screen Actors Guild Board at the time. He was working on a film with Director Walter Hill on a script written by John Milius called Geronimo: An American Legend. He was also ⁶⁶ in his cowboy boots and wore a Rodeo Champion Belt.

On-interest means that you have spoken with the talent and they are interested in working on it subject to business negotiations. To do the latter, you need about half a Million in the bank or full funding to create pay or play contracts. We are still hanging in there, looking for that first funding of 500k . We have had offers for 20 some years for other funding, but could never come up with the trigger funds of 500k . But his success in getting “on-interest” from actors was amazing, and it all started with Sir Ben Kingsley, and went from there to every actor Bob talked to, including Forest Whitaker, Cliff Robertson, Stuart Whitman, and even brought John Milius on board to direct, with Execs like Michael S Glick, a former studio head of MGM, and I brought Hoyt Axton, who brought former Doobie Brother and Steely Dan guitarist Jeffrey Skunk Baxter on board as the Composer.

Later, they would go on to do something brilliant. A worldclass Craft Service truck. What had started on Animal House as a card table and cooler, they made into an amazing piece of craftsmanship for the future of Oregon Film. In the meantime, I had been applying for jobs. Real jobs, not film. I was in a deep depression; I had spent all the money I had on two films that were going nowhere. Frankly, I wanted out of the business. It seemed to attract a lot of “Players.” People who wanted to take your hard work and talent and leverage it for their own self-aggrandizement and to “play” at producing.

You think I would have known better by now. I was such a Pollyanna. Then somebody sent me this: Still looking for a job (while Philip was in Bend) I applied at the Log Cabin Inn, a mile away in the woods, (where Philip and I had been married 5 years before) for a “Hostess” position. The owners were friends, and when Diane heard I was applying for the job, she started to laugh. “Katherine,” she said, “I JUST gave some filmmakers your phone number.” They were staying there, so just like Philip did, I just drove over there, and knocked on a door, a mile away. Once in a while you will get to work directly with the director, no AD in between; which was the case with Peter Werner. In all fairness, it usually happens when you are casting actors with speaking lines. That and locations is where I could shine. Having a literary background gave me the ability to visualize the locations and to work with the actors on their lines, to find the subtext. And Peter was having trouble with the Transpo Coordinator from LA. There was a lot of that in the mid 90’s. But Philip helped him with some picture cars. We had a 70’s pickup truck, a classic, Philip’s Dad had a 70’s Chevy Nova. But his favorite? Well, it was my car, a 1966 Mercury Comet. And Philip’s Mom and Dad got to be in the movie because they had to help me drive all the cars to set while Philip was on McKenna in Bend. But when I first met them, they were having lunch and looking at staying at the Log Cabin Inn because they were going to be filming outside of the studio zone of Eugene. A Studio Zone is anything within a 30-mile radius of the Production Office. So they were preparing for a company move after they finished all of the scenes in Eugene, and started filming up river. The first scene shot in my neighborhood was at Sahalie Falls. And Skip Cosper knew this author Rick Steber, who was one of the underlying copyright holders of my story Blanket of the Sun, and I invited him to the set. This tall handsome cowboy had the LA ladies smiling, including UPM Jean Higgins, who had recently lost her husband to cancer. That made me happy to see her smile. I was smiling too.

My favorite scene was shot here at the Dee Wright observatory, not far from us, in the Three Sisters Wilderness. It is made out of the lava fields created when the Cascade Mountain Range volcanos blew. It was the last scene, too. In the production meeting, I mentioned that there were a lot of deer, and to be careful on the McKenzie River Highway. I was lucky I was driving my Mercury Comet the year before (when I went to Montana) with a very sloped windshield. But with the “boxed” new cars, the deer can come through the windshield and kill you if you hit them right. One of the Producers from LA made fun of me and said “Yeah right. Killer Bambis.” Turns out he later swerved to avoid a deer and ended up rolled in the ditch in his convertible. Better than it ending up in the back seat, kicking him in the head! So on the last day of shooting, which traditionally involves pranking. (I had a lot of experience with being on the receiving end of The Pranksters and was able to give out what I got) I showed up in my 1966 Comet. I had Philip’s 1950’s deer-head mounted on the grill with sunglasses on, and a streamer sign that said, “Killer Bambi.” I can still hear the crew laugh. And because my job was done, I sat on set with Jean Higgins and needlepointed. By 1995 Oregon Film’s Executive Director David Woolson was hitting it out of the park. Oregon’s crew had become so big, we were meeting in Portland discussing a non-union union for all of us that weren’t either a teamster (in the AFL/CIO local) or in IATSE (the International Affiliation of Theatrical and Stage Employees). But Oregon was a Union state, not a “Right to Work” state. How could we keep taking chances on these new young filmmakers if they had to be in the Union first? It all came push to shove on Nowhere Man. AFL/CIO Local 399 in Los Angeles had world-wide jurisdiction. Screen Actors Guild did too. I didn’t know how IATSE and AFTRA were structured, jurisdiction wise. But there was so much work coming here the LA guys wanted our local jobs. And David Woolson wasn’t having it.

Philip had been hired as the Transportation Coordinator on Nowhere Man by Peter Dunne, his old boss on McKenna. And both Peter and David fought for him to keep it. It was clear that the growing pains of our industry was also bringing opportunities, and one day I called an Agent named Kathy Wilson who owned Wilson Entertainment. I had contacted her as a Casting Director about some talent I wanted to read for parts in The Four Diamonds. I had gone state-wide, including the Shakespearean Festival in Ashland, where I had made friends down there with a woman named Catherine Coulsen, who not only got a part, but brought me 2 great actors who ended up playing the English Knights. So, I was looking for someone like her in Portland. Kathy and I had bonded instantly, and the next thing I know I have an office at her office, expanding the Literary End of her agency. We had a great joke, it seemed that the people who knew her, and people who knew me, thought we were the same person. We did get a lot done! And when we teamed up, it was exponential. But there was trouble in River City. All the work up here was attracting “Out of Towners” including casting directors. Carol Lukens (Unhinged 1982) and I were Oregon’s first (Animal House 1978.) I met Carol in the 70’s through her Carol Edeliene Modeling Agency. She had an assistant named Nanette Troutman. When Carol married and became Carol Lukens, she seemed to be devoting her career to her new ABC Kids and Teens, young actors. Then actors Bo and Jeanne Medley even gave it a try. Jeanne soon made a brilliant move into doing payroll instead. (I made more money doing that on Dogfight than any film as a Casting Director.) Then Megann Ratzow started casting, and Nanette Troutman threw her hat in the ring. There were lots of others, too. The problem was, there wasn’t enough work to support all of them to survive. That’s when some strange fax wars began to LA production companies, bad-mouthing the competition. And Nanette Troutman held a meeting downtown at a hotel of all the Oregon casting people and casting/ talent agents. I went with Lo, who had started as an agent with Kathy Wilson. What was supposed to help unify these professionals turned into a thinly veiled disguise of an attack on one of them. I spoke up. “We all have to work together.” I said. “We need to stop badmouthing each other, or on-location films will not hire any of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:88:47e1109243d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 908, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "And Nanette Troutman held a meeting downtown at a hotel of all the Oregon casting people and casting/ talent agents.

I spoke up. “We all have to work together.” I said. “We need to stop badmouthing each other, or on-location films will not hire any of us. They will bring their own. That’s not good for Oregon Film or Oregon Talent.” That was NOT what one of them wanted to hear, and she started attacking me. That’s when Carol Lukens stood up. “Katherine was doing this first, before any of you, down in Eugene, and is one of the most honest people I know in this business.” And she said some other things about my integrity, but all I can remember is how I felt when she said this: “She’s the Godmother of Film in Oregon.” I figured that was a good time to leave, because the first woman who was being attacked was leaving, and I wanted to talk to her. We walked out and she admitted she had brought this on herself, drinking too much on a major film. I said, “that was no excuse for the vitriol” she had just experienced. “Because you know, I once had that problem too. And if I hadn’t sought out some help with it, Carol Edeliene Lukens would never have said those good words about me.” MGM, Esperanza Katz, Thunderbird Pictures, Stonebridge Entertainment, Universal Studios and 20^(th) Century Fox over them. I had several successful screenplay writers tell me that they were really, really good. And I owe it all to Rick. Because like me, he felt the best way to teach was to do. And I did, and redid. And he helped me. Which is what I was trying to pass on to 32 writers at Wilson Entertainment.

I loved it and worked really hard to get it financed. Somehow that got me the letter below. It’s the best explanation of the futility of the job I was trying to do, and I could never have come close to writing it as well as he did. So here it is. (Takeaguessat thebudget.The sum of film rights PLUS screenplay will maybe be 5.7% Not over that.Thisisa fora lowbudget film. Fora $2,0oo,0oo film,about $140,0o0. The percentage is naturally lower forhigh budget films.It is virtually impossible to finance a filmwithout at least one bankable person. Most independents working through Hollywood first put togetherthe well-known “package”–a known actor or director who commits to the script.) And in the early 90’s, Carolyn Chambers, the owner of KEZI TV had decided to build a 20MM film studio. We were all very excited about that. I thought that would be viable because she was her own built-in Master Lessor, with her television station KEZI TV. And she had owned cable companies before they even hit everyone else’s radar. So, David and I went to LA and took a meeting with Bob Colbert, Jack’s manager, at my favorite Rodeo Drive restaurant, La Scala; one that Mimi Machu had taught me to go to, because you could order a chopped salad and get bread for less than $5 . (She also taught me how to score a large Fiorucci Shopping Bag by buying one small thing for under $5 dollars.) It was a great trip, I had serious movement on several projects with studios and I was a very happy girl. But when I returned, I found out that Philip was not. The job he had as Transportation Coordinator on Nowhere Man was bartered away to keep the peace with the AFL/ CIO in LA. It really upset him, given the work it took to grow our industry in the first place, and the sacrifices we had made to help keep growing it. But what we gained was an agreement that pretty much exists still to this day. And that is that Oregon crew can be Driver Captains.

(“It’s powerful. It’s topical. It’s a fortune in baseball caps alone.”) So how did Oregon bring off such a spoof? It received clearances from each of the Hollywood talents used in the campaign, including Weaver, Madonna, Goldberg, Lee, Michael Jackson, Uma Thurman, Richard Dreyfuss, Gus Van Sant, Martin Sheen and Gerard Depardieu. No one was paid for the use of their names. He said the response to the campaign has been worth the roughly $70, 000 spent on the print advertisement, including several potential leads and some producers calling “to say, ‘I don’t have a project right now but, gee, you have very hip, very cool ads.’ I think we got a pretty good bang for the buck.” Especially on this one, Without Limits (1996); as we were able to have him home in Eugene, and not living in an apartment in Portland. It was the first in a string of real and well-paying Studio Films. The first one was with Warner Brothers, called Without Limits. It was about an old friend of mine that had died: Steve Prefontaine, a rock star of a runner. He wore the first Nike “Waffle-Iron” shoe made by Track Coach Bill Bowerman. AND he was quite a showman, and with a true Oregon Pioneer ethic, challenged the rules of the Amateur Sports Confederacy. (And in the 70’s he used to sneak cigarettes out of my purse at Taylor’s on campus next to our record store.) He died driving a MGB convertible, and strangely enough, my beloved friend David Hammer had an auto scrap part from Pre’s car in his own sports car, that killed him too, the same way, 3 % years later. They were so similar in looks, chutzpah, humor, and heart. They both were long distance runners who loved girls and drinking. They both died while rounding a curve, and flipped their small cars onto their chests. These chests of theirs were huge from running and breathing and running and breathing. It was like David was a stand-in for Pre, on a movie where both the stuntman and the Star were killed doing the same stunt. I was devastated both times. But by 1996, 20 years later, I was thrilled that his life story was making it to the big screen. From a story written by an Oregon writer, Kenny Moore.

The same guy who worked with the same director, Robert Towne, on Personal Best. But they both bombed at the box office, and I think I know why. The same pretense and ego was present on both. And then add a little residual strong-arming by the LA Teamsters. Phil had “a little accident” with a steel pole, right above his eye. The medic was a childhood friend, though, Ricky Wadkins; who fixed him up. Speaking of Hoyt, in 1996 (the same year) he had a stroke and asked me to come see him in Montana. I found myself going the back way, through the Wallowas following the Nez Perce Trail all the way along Highway 12 to where he lived in Hamilton. Hoyt’s mother Mae Boren Axton not only wrote Heart Break Hotel, but had introduced Elvis Presley to Colonel Tom Parker and pushed RCA to sign him. She was a Matchmaker. He had, at one time, actors Paul Newman and Robert DeNiro fighting over who got to play the Evil Wizard. He had Arlo Guthrie and Ringo Star on board. But he didn’t know how to end the story. He just knew he needed a happy ending for a story called Happy Song. He asked me to consider working on it with him. At the time, I was moving a 100-year-old house that my Mom was born in, onto my family’s 1870 Farm on the Willamette River. That was just like producing a movie. So many elements that needed to be orchestrated in order to work together. I asked him to give me some time. It took me two years to finish the house. Then he got remarried, and was on a Honeymoon forever, it seemed. We never got to it. The next big Hollywood Studio film to come to Oregon was in 1997. It also had our friend from the “Pre” film, Todd Lewis, as the UPM for Warner Brothers’ The Postman. It was being shot in Bend, one of our favorite little towns over the hills and through the woods. And Costner had made one of our favorite movies: Dances With Wolves (1990) just a few years before. We liked this plan. I’ve watched Rick treat Nez Perce Elders at Tamkaliks, who dance for 3 days in 112-degree heat, with their buckskin regalia covered with what looks like a hundred pounds of bead-work on them, and headdresses.

Ricky became the hero of the set that day, because Annie and Kevin got to get in his jet and go to the concert. On Postman, I was able to spend time with Philip on weekends there. And then the driver Philip hired on McKenna, Don Williams, had brought Patsy, his wife, too, and soon she was helping with wardrobe. They made friends with Kevin, and confided in me that they were thinking about creating a better type of Crafts Service truck, which was also the Medic’s truck. What used to be M&M’s and Band-Aids in 1977 had grown to a 2^(nd) meal kitchen and mini ambulance over the last 20 years. And for good reason. Postman was shot far from LA sound stage amenities. For all the films now on location in the Oregon boonies, it was time to separate the two uses so they could be upgraded utility wise. Which was a good thing, because there was no work at all for him for a year and % until April of 1999. This is not an easy life, never knowing when your next paycheck will be, or even if there is one. And the only way we made it was by finding houses that needed work, restoring them and then selling them. Which was really hard on the kids. But this particular house was a labor of love. It was built in 1890 by my great grand uncle Bartholomew, who gave it to my Grandparents as a wedding present in 1922. My mother was born in it in 1929. And it broke my heart, because after I moved it to the river side of our 1870 family farm, we discovered that a crystal meth kitchen on Marshall Island was being accessed from a 1/3^(rd) acre abandoned county park boat launch that our property surrounded on the Willamette River. But before we had sold the house, I got a call of some desperation from the UPM of Physical Graffiti. The Location Manager had quit, the Assistant was picking up the slack, would I please help out? I was delighted. It had been a very long time since our last paycheck, (over a year) and David Norris was on it, so why not?

I drove to Portland to stay at Kathy Wilson’s house where Philip stayed when working in Portland. It was very quiet and convenient, because it was in Lake Oswego, and close to the 217 highway to Vernonia where they were filming. Not long after that, I was on the phone in my car, parked in the shade of an old cherry tree. Suddenly I thought my car had started to move, and I instinctively put on the brake. But that didn’t work and it wasn’t what was happening. The old cherry tree was slowly falling on the car, and by the time I figured it out, it’s branches had embraced the whole car. That’s when driver Rob- But that wasn’t the worst of it. The special effects guys almost blew the town up in the final act’s car explosion. It could have killed someone. A rear bumper blew over our heads, and could have killed the Producer. Windows were blown out. Thankfully no one was hurt beyond minor glass scratches. I was so pissed at how they compromised the good will of Oregon. Then I was called away to Montana, where my best friend, Hoyt Axton was dying. He couldn’t come to me anymore, after years of calling me from the road on his “Honeysuckle Rose” bus and me driving down the McKenzie River Valley to meet him: in Roseburg, Pendleton, Pleasant Hill, Eugene, Portland, or even McKenzie Bridge, Oregon; as well as LA, Canyon Country, Ukiah, and West Hollywood, California; or Olympia, Whidbey Island, and Tacoma, Washington; even Cottonwood, Arizona or Nashville, Tennessee; and heck, even Las Vegas, Nevada. I had met him when I was 22, in Los Angeles, in 1973; and he won my friendship with his humor, loving ways, loyalty, songs and by playing his guitar. In August of 1999 he optioned the project Happy Song to me. The last time Philip and I saw him, in October of 1999, 2 weeks before he died, he was so weak, he asked me to come hold him while he sang his last songs to me. And he sang that he would “not rest easy until all of my dreams came true.” I will never give up trying to make his dreams come true either.

The core A-Team from the 70’s were represented by The Lawson Brothers, Bruce and Brian, Ken Erck, Sean Fong, Benjamin Hayden and of course, Philip, with some other Oregon Crew who had been around almost as long (the 80’s): Sean Kennedy, Kai Shelton, Michael Fine and Kent Lutrell, (who had returned from LA, after going there as a result of working on two films in the mid to late 80’s with me on Stand By Me and Finish Line); as well as the younger, newer Oregon Crew, at the time, in the 90’s: Sara Burton, Megann Ratzoff and Iris Cole Hayworth. Basically, it was a hang-out day at the beach, in front of the Tolovana Inn. She and her Mom got into a good –humored wrestling match there. No one recognized her so it was a mellow day for her. She was very serious about her craft and worked hard on becoming her character. One minute she goes into her dressing trailer as herself, and the next minute comes out with her hair in curlers, dressed in nothing but underwear, smoking a camel straight and pulling on a pint of bourbon; totally in character. –Philip Krysl Bill Badalato met with me about Hoyt Axton’s Happy Song. By that time, Dan Biggs and Will Vinton and I were working together, and I had rewritten the script, which Hoyt liked. Arlo Guthrie had come on board, and we were packaging. But of course, we needed a star. And Robert DeNiro was the best choice we could think of. Bob knew Hoyt, they did We’re No Angels together. And Bill really did try, but there was no interest in a project that was considered a dated song, and that had been used as “an anthem in movies depicting drugs and alcohol excess,” especially in 28 Days. I couldn’t break the mind-set that it was originally written as a song for a Children’s Animated Film and was the anthem for a Lost Generation. As for packaging the film, it was like always: Hoyt wrote Ringo Starr’s Hit The No No Song; Three Dog Nights’ Hit: Joy to the World; Arlo Guthrie’s Hit Light’n Bar Blues; he also wrote for an early, undiscovered Waylon", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242301_cleaned.txt:95:082095b495e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 915, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242301_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242301", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242301_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "as “an anthem in movies depicting drugs and alcohol excess,” especially in 28 Days.

After Bill, the only one who really tried was Academy Award Winner Producer Don Hahn, whom Dan Biggs hooked me up with, at The Portland Creative Conference in 2000. But he wasn’t doing very well, personally, and the opportunity soon faded. David Woolson told me that getting a movie made “was like getting all the planets to line up.” And it “was a miracle that any of them get made.” It broke my heart to give up, but once again I had given it everything I had. So, I needed a job to pay back the 25k I spent on development; and I once again also decided to get a REAL job and go into the 100-year-old-House Restoration & Moving Business: House Set Design LLC. Trying to get the planets to line up for funding was killing me, I wanted to work with something tangible and down to earth. And moving houses was a lot easier than producing a film. Just so you know. Philip however, was on a roll. Gone were the never-ending days of being in a back-breaking key position for the Transportation Department. (Transpo guys are usually the first to arrive on set and the last to leave. For the coordinator, 120-hour work weeks are the norm) Now, he was working as a Cast and Studio driver, and they treated him really well. He didn’t even have to drink out of a hose or try to coordinate navigation for the huge semi-trucks for company moves all over creation. It seemed like wherever he went, film people seemed to trust him with driving their irreplaceable talent.

And Mimi loved her small Oregon crew. She had some trouble with the Canadian crew, which was evident when they arrived with the camera package to the Marriott Hotel, and left the truck with one wheel on the curb and all the tires flat. The Driver couldn’t be found, either, with the keys. Evidently, he had taken a cab to Flight Craft at the airport where he could sleep all day for free. The Grip truck driver couldn’t speak English, and the Film Loader was really unprofessional. David had moved on the year before to another entertainment arena, where he felt he could do the most good, but left the Oregon Film Office in capable hands with Veronica Rinard, a former staff member who stepped into his shoes and kept it on this incredible trajectory. And she had help, because by now Bob Schmaling, who was in Oregon’s first film crew, had joined her in the Oregon Film Office.

They have been with us ever since, but found different niches for their talents. When they were filming by Rosyln Lake, the greens guys were dropped off on old logging roads and told to collect the moss out of trees day after day after day. The rumor was these guys ate a lot of mushrooms and took a lot of naps. So, they must have been finding more than moss up there. I imagine an LA crew would find the woods of Oregon rather enchnating.

Philip said one flew down Broadway barely high enough to clear the buildings. However, that wasn’t the only volatile thing that happened on The Hunted, there were several. The next was actor Tommy Lee Jones, who, rumor had it, was having a really hard time because his girlfriend was off playing Polo with some Brazilian Playboy Millionaire, and was taking it out on the screenplay writer. One day in Port Townsend, Philip gave Tommy a ride to the set on a slippery muddy road with no guard rail, a road that was on the very edge of a cliff 400 feet above the Elway River. There, walking alone on the edge, looking at the river, was the screenplay writer. Tommy Lee grabbed the wheel of Philip’s truck to try to hit him. Let’s just say the content of the interaction concerned Philip enough to take it to his Driver Captain. The next thing he knew, Billy wanted Philip to come to set, asap. He knew him because Philip was Sherry Lansing’s driver (Billy’s wife) when she flew in as the head of Paramount to see her husband, which was often, because the film was way over budget. She was his boss. When Philip got back to the set, Friedkin was standing out in the road covered with mud waiting for him. “Did Tommy Lee try to have you kill the screenplay writer?” Philip was silent. “Did he grab the wheel?” Philip finally responded to that. “Yes, but it was a joke.” Billy let out a deep breath. “Sorry about that.

Because of this, her attitude was different from others and she noticed that some elements of the Church’s dogma were not consistent with her personal experience. When she was talking to priests, she also had no reserve in defending her views. She could be quite sharp to the officiating priest or chaplain. I remember the occasion when a chaplain visited our home, to inquire when the family would expect the next child. I can still hear her words of anger. “What are you thinking? It is none of your business! If this is what you came for, you’d better leave right now!” Now, many years later, I can fully confirm this; for I share her experience that much of what the Church wants believers to believe without question is completely opposite to what I personally experience. To give an example: The Church teaches that the soul, after death, moves to heaven, purgatory or hell, depending on how a person has lived. However, when as a child, I told my mother I had seen my grandfather, she explained that what I saw and experienced was a proof of life on the other side. My grandfather was not at all in heaven or in hell, in fact he was suddenly standing in my bedroom. I was taken by surprise, although I was used to seeing people who passed away. I was shocked too, because this was my own grandfather and that changed the experience. It is not the same as if I saw someone I did not know. I pinched my arm to check if I was awake. I was not dreaming, for sure! When my grandfather noticed that I was convinced of what I had seen, he disappeared again. This sort of occurrence regularly happened at my home. One morning, my mother said to my father, “Today, Ferdinand Miras is going to pay us a visit!” My dad initially had to laugh. In his view, this was impossible, for they had not heard from this man for more than twenty years. Nevertheless, he was not completely sure, because he knew very well that his wife, having premonitions like this, was usually proven right. That same day, around noon, Ferdinand stood in front of the door. Following the common practice in my time and environment, I became an acolyte and chorister. Without thinking, I did what I was expected to do, but what surprised me, was the general attitude within the Church towards liturgical objects.

If we touched one of these items anyway, we knew something bad would happen to us. Aside from that, it was a sin and you had to confess a sin. If we did not do so, we would go to hell. We were bound to get into trouble. On many occasions, I thought to myself, “This is such nonsense!” One day, despite many warnings, I mustered all my courage. At a certain time, when nobody was around in the consistory, I took the chalice in my hands. At first, I felt hesitant, but when I noticed nothing out of the ordinary happened, I took hold of this sacred object and, in a feeling of triumph, convinced myself nothing was happening. To this day, I have not succumbed to a chronic disease because of my sacrilege. For example, my parents taught me that there was no need to accept certain forms of physical contact or intimacy, not even from priests or monks. I remember an incident from primary school. Monks ran the school I attended, in The Hague. The teacher of the 6th grade was a small fat monk, a clingy kind of man. In those days, the teacher would sit behind a big lectern, placed on a platform. One day, he asked me to come to the front. He went over my homework, while I stood beside his chair. Suddenly, I felt his hand slide over my leg. First, it went down and then up again. He tried to slip his fingers underneath the leg of my shorts. My parents’ lesson shot through my mind. I stretched my arm out and slapped him on the shoulder. He probably had not expected a thirteen-year-old boy to act like that. Nevertheless, I was successful! The teacher immediately stopped and his face went scarlet. I raced back to my spot and he never attempted it again. It is understandable that this kind of misconduct stems from personal frustration. Unfortunately, there were, and still are, many instances of child abuse never brought out into the open. If something happened that became public, it was quickly covered up again. Although this kind of abuse has gotten more publicity in the past decade, most of it is still covered up carefully. Therefore, I find it hard to avoid the impression that the leaders of the Church will always do their utmost to preserve their public image. I know that I am not the only one who feels this way.

When I was seventeen, I entered a monastery that belonged to a congregation of friars. The peace and silence I found there appealed to me. The fact that my older brother was a member of the same congregation probably played a part in this. The congregation occupied itself with education and caring for psychiatric patients. The home I lived in at the time was connected to a boarding school for boys. Aside from education, a lot of attention was given to sports, study and recreation. I remember very well, that there were brothers who experienced personal problems dealing with sexual issues and who had affectionate bonds with some boys. I do not wish to be the judge of that. These bonds were euphemized as “special friendships” and forbidden by the rules of the monastery. The celibacy of monks and priests is a regulation that goes against human nature, causing the person to grow crooked and to possibly associate with children placed in their care, in an unacceptable way. My activities were predominantly in the monastery itself and therefore I was not involved with the boarding school. During those days, I was taken up with studying and my passion for music. Shortly before I turned 22, I resigned. I was facing the choice of taking “the eternal vow,” but I knew I could not make a lifelong connection to a way of life that I could not fully support. The procedure that followed my decision says a lot about the power of the Church. In order to resign, I had to ask permission of the Holy See (Holy Chair), the official name for the Vatican. I got frustrated, because they kept me waiting for two months and I was eager to start a new life. They informed me that I could not discuss this with anybody, not even after receiving Rome’s permission to go. One night, they told me to get ready to leave early next morning. Leaving meant somebody took me to another congregation home, where nobody knew me. I had to stay there for another week. The whole process was very mysterious and secretive. After that week, I received a one-hour notice that I was to prepare myself for leaving once more. Somebody took me to a monastery in Venray, where I received a set of new clothes and some pocket money.

Then, somebody took me to Nijmegen and put me on the train to The Hague, where my parents lived. As an adolescent, developing into an adult, I came across some situations that I thankfully have distanced. From my own experience, however, I know what is happening behind the scenes. They keep up outward appearances of a celibate life, when the reality is completely different. Fortunately, it was not like this everywhere. Without doubt, there have always been clergymen who live their lives in purity. Shortly after my return from the monastery, I met someone of my own age, who had left a different order a little while ago. Both of us had not partaken in society between the ages of 17 and 22, and that meant we missed an important part of our development. Bert and I made a step-by-step plan, in order to re-adapt ourselves to a normal life. To give an example, we still tended to walk with our hands in our sleeves. It was early 1958. We learned to dance and were terribly shy. When we tried to ask a girl to dance, we turned scarlet. We wanted to get rid of these sorts of peculiarities as soon as possible, and it worked, for within a year nobody would have guessed that we had once been monks. Our success originated from the fact, that we did not avoid any circumstances. On top of that, we kept encouraging one another. Within myself, I always experienced a desire to be of service to others. During this period, the idea became stronger to make a living out of it. I made a list of my skills and decided to stay with psychology, because I had been studying this during my monastic period. Apart from that, I took courses in a medical as well as a psychiatric hospital. Following Croiset’s advice, I started to put my talents to use. People came to me for advice and I used my clairvoyant capabilities to help them in many fields. The results were very encouraging. Gradually it turned into a practice, in which I was active as a psychic as well as a psychosocial therapist. The most striking fact of all was that even monks and nuns came to me.

Usually, while conducting a conversation, I spontaneously receive clairvoyant images from the person. In this case, I was taken back to a period in which women were prosecuted and condemned as witches. I saw a monk, clad in a black and white habit, who accused her of seducing him. I discovered there are women who have carried experiences like this along with them through several lives. I also met a pastor who was still active in his parish and felt weighed down by a huge moral dilemma. On the one hand, he functioned as a priest, and on the other hand, he was in a relationship with a woman he loved. Following my advice, he finally resigned his office in the church and half a year later he found employment as a teacher in a secondary school. When I saw him again, he told me a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. I remember a nun visited my practice, who was dealing with emotional problems because the nuns within her community bullied and neglected her. She lived in a small monastery and was the one who dealt with all the household chores. The co-sisters looked down upon this nun, because they themselves worked in the field of education. In order to be able to help her, I had to contact her mother superior. The provincial superior also lived in the same monastery. The three of them came to my practice a week later. It was a completely new experience for me to be a mediator, but in my own way, I managed to convince both superiors that they had to take measures to solve the problems and had to do so in a loving way. Monasteries are simply communities of people who can fall victim to domination and manipulation. Despite the fact that my practice was very busy, I maintained a keen interest in the background of the Christian religion. Ever since my childhood years, I wanted to find out how it started and what had gone wrong. I studied the Bible and the apocryphal writings. I read books by cultural historians and other researchers.

While reading these books, I would spontaneously receive clairvoyant images of events that had taken place in several ages. People have always been treated atrociously. The images I received were horrible. For instance, I was shown how people were tortured during the time of the Inquisition, for the simple reason that they had a mind of their own. My dreams, too, revealed a lot to me and sometimes I was even carried away in a vision. In one of those visions, I saw an inquisitor take a woman from a dungeon and then rape her. Then he accused her of seducing him, after which they killed the woman immediately. I was looking for confirmation and so I asked a fellow regression therapist, if he could do some sessions with me. During these five sessions, it became clear to me that I had been active in several strategic positions within the Roman Catholic Church. I also discovered that I had undergone tremendous suffering during the persecutions in the early ages of Christianity. After these sessions, I harbored a deep aversion to visiting Rome, a subject that really occupied my mind. From the depths of my subconscious, many things came to the surface. I found the confirmation I had been looking for, but I also received lots of valuable complementary information. Among other things, I found out that I myself had been a Cardinal and even an inquisitor. In 2002, I visited Rome. The visit was not self-evident; it was preceded by some occurrences. I had built up an attitude of resistance towards everything that had to do with the Catholic Church and so I obviously never intended to go to Rome. During that year, my family and I spent a holiday in Tuscany, Italy. An incredibly beautiful region. However, the most special thing about it was that during this stay in Tuscany, I gave up my long-time resistance to pay a visit to Rome. One morning at breakfast, I told my wife and children that I intended to go to Rome the next day. They looked at me in amazement and were very quiet. After a little while, my oldest son reacted, “Are you okay, daddy?” Very understandable from his point of view because I had never hidden the fact that in my view only a complete idiot would consider visiting Rome. I must admit, that it was beyond my comprehension; I simply woke up with the feeling that I had to go.

I must admit, that it was beyond my comprehension; I simply woke up with the feeling that I had to go. The only thing I knew at that moment was that I’d had a dream, but I did not recall where the dream had occurred. The need to visit Rome was so strong, that I managed to convince my family. During this visit, I experienced many contradictory emotions and it felt like I was turned upside down. Experiencing Rome had not taken away my feelings of resistance against the Church. On the contrary, these feelings were strengthened further by everything that I came across there. My resistance was growing, and I felt more assertive. Some sort of alarm had gone off. It was clear that I could no longer avoid the issue and I realized that I had to deal with it one way or another. That night, I had a dream in which I was walking around in Rome. There was a medieval monastery, or an old castle, and I saw a spiral staircase going down. I went down that staircase and entered a cellar in which no light could penetrate. In the darkness I felt my way, touching the wall, and found a candleholder made of iron that still held a piece of candle. I searched my pocket, found a box of matches and lit the candle. By the light of the candle, I could see niches that were closed off by iron fences. From one of these niches came a sound of moaning. I took the candle and followed the sound. In the niche, I saw a man, lying on the floor. He turned his face toward the light and looked at me. I could discern a reddish beard. In his eyes, I could see that he was begging me to get him out of there. I tried to open the fence by pulling it forcefully, but it did not give way. I now recall that I was not at all afraid. Straw covered the floor and the smell was horrible. When I held the candle between the bars of the fence, I could see that the man was chained to a short beam. The beam in its turn was chained to the wall. Suddenly, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw a rat scurrying about. I was so shocked that I dropped the candle, which caused the straw to catch fire. I ran as fast as I could up the stairs again.

I was very confused when a man approached me, bearing the same face I had seen in the dungeon. After this, I woke up. I felt the need to share my experiences on paper, and the need kept growing stronger. There was, however, also fear, and it grew stronger during the writing process. I feared the consequences of writing down all I knew. Despite the fact that others told me this made no sense, and being aware of the fact that, nowadays, there is a separation between Church and state, the fear of being persecuted was giving me strong doubts. Despite my initial fears, I decided to follow through. It is my intent to present a clear image of the degree to which Christian history is in disarray. It took another few years before I could put this fear into perspective and let go. Looking at it from the present, my life has been a quest, as well as a process of dealing with several other earlier lives. Nowadays, we are witnesses of how the Christian churches attract fewer and fewer people and how spirituality is taking its place within society at the same time. Spirituality and consciousness are growing. More and more people experience an inner growth, and this makes the subconscious open up, which brings inner knowing to the surface. The spiritual value has developed from Gnosticism. “Gnosis” is about inner knowledge, a knowing that people in ancient times could rely on, because in those days people followed their intuition and the thinking mind was considered inferior. Nowadays our spirituality follows the same rules. Our talents are hidden within our intuitive life. Thankfully, more and more people experience a spiritual growth. I encountered the same themes everywhere: power, ego and fear. It became clear to me that in all Christian factions Bible texts were interpreted in different ways, not all of them commendable. As an example: when somebody showed criticism and pointed out some weak areas and persisted, they often referred to “the angel of light,” from a Bible text dealing with the devil. This happened to me also, and I left with the feeling of having been cast out. There was also frequent reference to “the lost one,” and this term would be applied to both those who are not Christian and those who are Christian but do not belong to their circle. This way of thinking is hypocritical, and I encountered it within all Christian religious communities. I also encountered a religious community that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:7:ab00afe6e001", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 927, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "from a Bible text dealing with the devil.

This way of thinking is hypocritical, and I encountered it within all Christian religious communities. I also encountered a religious community that focused on concordant translations. Their translations are straight from the Greek and they try to show the literal meaning. They discovered that many words have been given the wrong meaning. However, even they do not realize that the Bible is an assembled book that presents a distorted image and that men made up most of it to suit their own interests. During the1970’s, the number of churchgoing people fell into a steep decline and many turned their backs on religion. The former churchgoers now discovered themselves and started to develop their personal freedom. Many people discovered a new spiritual perspective and became conscious of their own inner strength. Spirituality started to blossom and now, in this day and age, one can no longer neglect it. Personally, I am convinced that sexual abuse has alwys been present and only increased ever since they institutionalized celibacy. During the time when Church and State were not separated, there was always a massive lack of personal freedom. Until the 1950’s and 60’s, even talking publicly about sex was a kind of heresy. In my view, the official church teachings are false, as I discovered that the writings of the New Testament are no more than a limited selection from thousands of fragments. The chosen texts were manipulated and regularly revised. They added or omitted all kinds of information. As we know them, the biblical gospels are falsified and hold many gaps. I do not merely want to attack the institution of the Church, but to demonstrate how it actually works. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church throughout history have been guilty of extreme forms of crime; abuse of power, fraud, deception, torture and murder. Thereby, they arrogantly ignored every human right which was inconvenient to them. Is it not time to negate many opinions of the Roman Catholic Church, especially pertaining to their statements on life and death? Every person is responsible for his own life. However, in general, the fear of death reigns and people do not have the guts to confront life. The hypocritical pronouncements of the Roman Catholic authorities are at odds with the things they have done for centuries, like the killing of people in the most atrocious ways.

It would be a credit to these dignitaries if they removed all the smoke and mirrors, which in these days have become irrelevant. Is it not true that charity is one of the most important pillars of Christian belief? How can it be that the ideal and reality have grown so far apart? When we realize that for centuries religious leaders have preached charity while at the same time practicing greed and elitism, we should become doubtful about the Christian theological teachings that have been presented to us, and their doctrines. On which of those, and whose, is it actually based? ment I grew up in as a miniature society, in which the only thing that mattered was to be a Catholic. In those days, there was some segregation in the Netherlands. It is undeniable that in the 1940’s and 50’s there was not much to do in the Catholic south of the country. North of the big rivers, everything was different. Those regions were inhabited by people who thought differently – by Calvinists or other strict reformists. The churches there always expected people to wear black stockings, which was the symbol of a very strict way of life. That is how we described those people and when we talked about them, it seemed so far away, as if we were speaking of a foreign country. During the war and all it entailed we attached a lot of importance to whatever the pastor preached to us on Sunday. Most people did not have much money to spend and there was an atmosphere of threat and insecurity. Their daily existence was the thing that kept people occupied. In this world, I grew up in a traditional Catholic family. Sundays, High Mass and Praise were obligatory. The same went for some other days also. We had to attend Praise on Wednesday evening and were obliged to go to church every first Friday of the month. In May and October (the months devoted to Mother Mary), we visited church every night for the rosary prayer. I grew up with themes like the Ten Commandments, and getting indulgence, which we could earn by lighting a candle and reciting, six times, the prayers of Our Father and Hail Mary. After that, we would leave the church for a moment and all would start over again. Every time we followed this routine, we deserved an indulgence on behalf of a deceased person. All devout Catholic persons followed this scheme, because they followed their leaders and believed what the Church taught them.

All devout Catholic persons followed this scheme, because they followed their leaders and believed what the Church taught them. One can compare this to a sect, for the members were brainwashed by their leaders and had their minds turned around. People accepted delusions and fabrications without further investigation. I can still hear my father say, “The pope is infallible in his declarations.” It is clear to me that this morbid comedy has been playing for ages. It was most successful during times when common people did not know how to read or write. In September 1942, my mother took me to school for the first time and I was not exactly eager to go. I was an early pupil, only six years old. With the war raging, there was no such thing as nursery school. During that first year in school, I experienced my First Holy Communion. It was common practice to place the word “holy” before other words, whether it was justified or not. Did this really add any value? Now I know that the Catholic Church wanted this word to convey some sort of elevation, but apart from this woolly, unrealistic theological thinking, the basic meaning of the word holy is simply: “complete.” When I grew up it was common practice for the entire first class of a Roman Catholic primary school to be prepared for First Communion. It was not a matter of choice and we simply went with it. Nowadays, parents and child together make the decision whether or not to take First Communion. That is why few children take their First Communion these days. The question arises: who ever came up with this? However, in those days the Church was still the dominant center of society, where people adored the pastor or chaplain of their religious community. It was what people were used to and they were, in a manner of speaking, blind, because nobody noticed the degree of manipulation of this institution called “the Church.” Part of the preparation for First Communion consisted of learning several songs. One of them stuck in my mind. It clearly made a big impression. The first part of the song was, “My Jesus, Beloved Lord, lives behind the golden door of the altar.” I remember while I was singing this, it filled me with loathing, but I did not understand why. During visits to the church, the atmosphere of candle light, incense, song and music, was very soothing for me and I would usually drift away into daydreams.

During visits to the church, the atmosphere of candle light, incense, song and music, was very soothing for me and I would usually drift away into daydreams. Looking at it from my current viewpoint, I think I would have revolted if I had had the capacity to reflect on it, at that time. Utter nonsense of course, Jesus living behind the golden altar door. In my mind, I see the famous Dutch comedian Toon Hermans, telling the public he was knocking on the little door, but nobody ever answered. This is a playful remark, but in fact, it is appalling that even adults did not question this nonsense! Another example is the Catechism, from which it is clear to what degree we were brainwashed. When I go back in my memory, I still feel anger surging inside me. Looking at it objectively, it is a stupid game of question and answer, which may be appropriate for children, but certainly not for adults. I even wonder if the authors were perhaps children themselves, or if they were simply senile? How many people are still aware of the Catechism? Not many, I presume. This is why I decided to look more closely at this paradigm of the Catholic theological teachings. Quoting some questions and answers: The teacher taught us also biblical history and about the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) and the confession of faith, which is the Creed of the Catholic Church. Looking back, I now realize the genius of these lessons. The friar knew, acting from his personal religious experience, how to open the hearts of children, in an emotional and almost theatrical way, and then spread the seeds of the Catholic faith. He must have felt great satisfaction, knowing he had fulfilled his task in a splendid manner. The entire class was mesmerized listening to his story and the children looked at the beautiful illustrations of biblical stories that the teacher showed. These friars must have been trained to present their story in a very lively manner. Another example of acting were the preachers, mostly Franciscans or Augustinians, who would often shamelessly conduct the meditations of suffering from the pulpit. They were complete little plays, theatrical to the core. The friar told us about the Emperor Constantine, who, during one of his hunting parties had seen a deer carrying a shining cross between his antlers. He showed us a beautiful illustration of this occurrence.

He showed us a beautiful illustration of this occurrence. As a child, I was very susceptible to this kind of story, but I also experienced a feeling of resistance, of doubt about what I was told. During my quest, I concluded that, indeed, many of those beautiful stories they told us were not accurate at all. The subject of the Catholic Church had become an important issue to me in another way: I used it to search for the truth. My curiosity was aroused while reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, written by Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln. The book was a revelation to me and at the same time, it confirmed what I already knew. Having conducted research for many years these scientists uncovered secrets that form the basis of our Western civilization. From the first chapter the book intrigued me, and I could not stop reading. My research consisted, largely, of reading books that discussed in detail the history of the Catholic Church, the papacy and the Bible. However, what I read did not surprise me at all. In most cases, I received images within myself that confirmed what I was reading and formed a supplement to it. My journeys through France and to Rome also supplied me with important information and insights on these subjects. Thus, I discovered that the Roman Catholic Church came into being during a period of great confusion. During the first two centuries C.E., Rome was the center of the European world – a melting pot with people of many nationalities. There were various cults and hundreds of different gods, originating from all kinds of places. The disorder was such that a need began to arise in many minds for a religion centering around one God. In the Bible, we read that Jesus was the son of a poor carpenter, born of a virgin, immaculately conceived, and referred to as the Son of God. All very vague and questionable information. All along, it was clear to me that this nonsense simply could not be the truth. Therefore, my quest started with the questions: What is the origin of all this? Moreover, what is the real truth? Despite the fact that the Roman Church destroyed many writings, in order to delete all traces of their deception and malpractice, in 1945 a farmer in Nag Hammadi (Upper Egypt) found a jug. It contained writings dating from the first centuries of Christianity. Scientific research on these texts has shown us that the story of Jesus, as officially presented, is a big lie.

It contained writings dating from the first centuries of Christianity. Scientific research on these texts has shown us that the story of Jesus, as officially presented, is a big lie. Of course, this is sensitive information. I simply feel we should not ignore the truth that finally came to the surface after so many centuries hidden. Not long after, in 1947, a shepherd found another jug with some very ancient manuscripts, in the caves near Chirbet Qumran, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea. These writings give us a lot of insight into the time when Jesus was born. Several texts show us that Jesus was a rebel. He took exception to the authority of the Roman occupation, but he also did not agree with the orthodox leaders of the Jewish faith. Both sources confirm that Jesus was a pretender to the throne of David, descended from the old bloodline, and his parents were far from poor. One can draw this conclusion from texts that show his mother associated with other women of importance and fortune. Therefore, Joseph was definitely not a poor carpenter. These documents shed a new light on the origin of Christianity. They give information about the old world, but also about the person of Jesus. They make it easier to understand why the Roman Empire sometimes persecuted the followers of Jesus. To me, the main point is that they show how the Christian faith as we know it today, is based on falsehood. The fact that these texts were found was a miscalculation by the Catholic Church. In my view, the Bible, especially the New Testament, is no more than a form of literature. It is meant specifically to achieve certain aims by spreading this invented message. Carefully selected texts were combined as if they belonged together. A new sort of theological Christianity had arisen, in which the scholars (exclusively men) played an important part, as “Fathers of the Church.” At the end of the second century C.E., Church Father Irenaeus (bishop of Lyon), selected some evangelical texts from the more than thirty that were current at the time. He chose four, for the simple reason that there were four quarters on a compass. These scriptures were anonymous. It was later on that the names of Mark, Luke, Matthew and John were attached to them. His choices were very sexist: all references to the status of women had to be banished. Writings that did not fit in with his selection were confiscated and burned. There must have been hundreds.

Their contents will always remain unknown, but we know they were mostly Gnostic writings, describing the life of Jesus, his marriage to Mary Magdalene and his offspring. The truth had to be disguised. Irenaeus condemned the followers of Jesus in Nazareth, because they claimed Jesus had been born as a human being and was not of divine descent. Irenaeus proclaimed Jesus had preached the wrong religious teachings and was mistaken in his religious convictions. The Church did everything in its power to reform the life of Jesus in order to make it fit in with the story they claimed was true. The four gospels as we know them from the New Testament are contradictory. There is the story of Jesus being born in a stable, which we have always been told. It may sound romantic when recited before an open fire and it may have some sentimental value, but it simply cannot be true. Let us look at it with discernment. Matthew and Luke both wrote about the birth and descent of Jesus, but their versions are very different, as well as their time-frames. Mention of a census during the reign of the first Emperor, Augustus, cannot be found anywhere in historical texts. In all probability, if a census of this stature had taken place, historians would have recorded it. According to Luke this census took place in the year 6 C.E., during the reign of Quirinus, and according to Matthew, Herod died in the year 4 B.C. Obviously, this information is contradictory, because there is a gap of at least nine years. Luke, who pretended to be a historian, wanted to lend credibility to his story by adding the name of Emperor Augustus. This was usual in those days. However, there was no census in those days: there was a registration in the tax register, which was a regional matter. This was the conclusion of scientific research led by Emil Schürer in 1885. It appeared that the registration was for two different sorts of taxes: personal taxes and property taxes. These contradictions could never have been solved without the communal archives of the Essenes, as written down in the Dead Sea Scrolls. From them we learn that there were two sorts of birth: first the physical birth (as recounted by Matthew) and then birth into the community, which entailed a ritual rebirth (as noted by Luke). There is a gap of twelve years between the two births. A child then", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:14:308617ab906b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 934, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "two different sorts of taxes: personal taxes and property taxes.

There is a gap of twelve years between the two births. A child then became a member of the Jewish community at the age of thirteen. Luke 2:41-50 says that Jesus, at twelve years old, was detained in the temple and said to his parents, “Didn’t you know that I have to be in the house of my Father?” In fact, this refers to twelve years after he became a member of the Jewish community. He was 24 years old and had to discuss his status with the teachers of the temple. Here his “Father” refers to his religious father, the high priest, the “father” of the Jewish community. The occurrence on Jesus’ 24^(th) birthday in the temple gives us the exact month of his birth. Luke states it was during Easter. Jews celebrate Easter in March, which is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. According to the Essene dating system the term for every first day of the month was this day, or “today.” Luke 2:11 says, “Today a savior was born in the city of David.” Judging from the difference between the Hebrew and Roman calendars, Jesus was born on March 1, in the year 7 B.C. So, where did he actually live? Joseph came from Bethlehem and lived there, so it seems logical that Jesus lived there too. This is the most obvious conclusion, because Bethlehem was the town of King David, of whom Jesus was a direct descendant. Why would the Romans make a registration of Joseph in the tax register, if he did not live in Bethlehem and was not affluent? Because of this, the story of the inn must be false as well. If a person owns a home in Bethlehem, why not sleep there in comfort, rather than stay at an inn, instead? The mention of a “carpenter,” walking beside a donkey on which his heavily pregnant wife was seated has to be taken in the symbolic sense. It is a fabricated story.

Research shows that Jesus was the son of wealthy parents, both of whom were of royal blood: Joseph was born into the House of David and Mary belonged to an Armenian dynasty. The Catholic Church wants us to believe that the conception of Jesus happened by divine intervention, a visiting angel. This too is complete nonsense. Of course, Joseph and Mary conceived the child in the natural way. From Essene writings, it is known that the “coming in of the soul” was viewed as supernatural. Luke describes it as the Holy Spirit. In the Bible, we read that Jesus was standing on the shore of the lake of Galilee and said to the fishermen Peter and Andrew, “Come, and follow me.” This text wants us to believe that a following of twelve apostles came into being in this manner. It’s another lie, because these apostles were no fishermen. It is very naïve to believe this, because when somebody tells someone else to “come and follow me,” would they miraculously turn away from their profession and family, just like that? Nice fabrication, but not very realistic. In the Essene writings, we find that there were indeed twelve apostles, but they were more like political representatives of Jesus. Their task was to recruit followers for their cause. When a number of people wished to join them, they were invited to the joining ceremony. This can be compared to joining a political party and the taking of the oath that follows. The ceremony consisted of all new members immersing themselves in the water, after which, they were literally fished up in nets by the apostles. After that, these non-Jews were included in the Jewish traditions. Therefore, the apostles were “fishers of people.” They were not poor, illiterate, professional fishermen, as the Church would like us to believe. The procedure the Messiah followed was part of the Jewish law. Among the apostles were his brothers James, Thomas, and Judas, as well as Simon-Lazarus, Peter and Philip. The Bible tells us that Jesus performed miracles, made the lame walk, made the blind see and so on. But were they really miracles? Jesus was a healer, trained by the Essenes, who knew a lot about natural healing. He supplied the ailing with energy and power, in order to stimulate their energetic circulation. This is more or less the same kind of medicine the Greeks practiced around 400 B.C. Hippocrates of Cos and his followers applied their hands to people’s bodies to incite healing and made use of medicinal herbs. This practice is still in sway and there is no need of miracles!

I think back on my own practice, where I would treat people who were bent-over by sciatica. I helped the energy flow and distracted them, in order to break through the mental spiral they were in. Afterwards they would walk upright again, free of pain. The medical world would look upon a recovery like this as a miraculous event, but it is certainly no miracle in the sense meant by the Church. The gospels tell us about the Last Supper. This is false too! Having the status of Messiah, Jesus was obliged to host a Messianic Banquet at least once a year, with the twelve representatives. This event was twisted, and the biblical version of the Last Supper came into being. The mythical images of bread and wine were added later. In one of these, the gospel of Philip, we read that Jesus mostly held company with three women: his mother Mary, his sister Sarah-Salome and Mary Magdalene, his companion. Jesus loved Mary Magdalene in a different way. He used to kiss her on the mouth in the presence of disciples. The others witnessed his love for Mary and asked him, “Why do you love her more than any of us?” Jesus answered, “Why I do not love you, the way I love her? Well, if a blind person and a person with sight are in the dark together, there is no difference between them. But when the light emerges, the person with sight will see the light and the blind person has to remain in the dark.” The fact that Jesus kissed her on the mouth means there was intimacy between them. Jesus treated Mary Magdalene like a partner, in a physically loving way. According to the Nag Hammadi library, Mary Magdalene acted as an intermediary between Jesus and his disciples, who did not always understand what he intended to convey. Despite the fact that it was unusual for a woman, in those days, to come to the fore, Jesus encouraged her to speak. He praised her abundantly and openly. This was hard to take in for the apostles, being used to a male-dominated culture. Some disciples called her “the woman who knows the All.” This means either Jesus informed Mary Magdalene about the cosmic laws, or perhaps she was wise in her own right.

In the Gospel of the Roman Church, there is reference to Jesus expelling seven demons from Mary Magdalene. They mean seven evil spirits. This is a lie, a distortion of the truth. The Nag Hammadi library makes it clear that she received seven initiations from Jesus. Mary Magdalene, as a woman, lived in the near vicinity of Jesus and this would only be possible if she were a near relative, like a cousin, or even a wife. In the orthodox Jewish tradition, the man is considered superior. The woman lost her status of being equal to the man, which she had in the Essene tradition. Peter was not fond of women and the fact that Mary Magdalene was the wife of Jesus, was mostly repressed. In the Bible, Paul proclaimed that women were not allowed to speak in church. They could not claim their part in whatever function men held. In the beginning, Christianity was largely a movement following Jewish ways. The first Christians were usually from Jewish origin and held onto many traditional viewpoints. During the second century, a process of separation came about in the Church: the men were responsible for the ritual side and the women revered in silence. Quintus Tertullianus, a Church father with the style of Paul, took measures at the end of the second century to ensure that women were no longer involved in the Church. They were not allowed to officially engage in religious practice and if they did so anyway, they were called a whore or a witch. In the Gnostic tradition, Mary Magdalene was surrounded by wisdom. In Greek, “sophia” was symbolized as the sun, the moon and a shining wreath of stars. It was also referred to as “the complete spirit.” This is very different from the Holy Spirit, the translation propagated by the Church. Later on, they connected this shining wreath of stars to Jesus’ mother, the other Mary. With the fabrication of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit (the so-called Divine Trinity), everything was taken completely out of context in order to fit in with the new dogma of the Apostolic Church of Peter, whose viewpoints are clearly brought forward in the Gospel of Thomas, in which he seriously objects to the presence of Mary Magdalene in Jesus’ following. In the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, Peter doubts her relationship to Jesus. “Would he really have spoken intimately with a woman, and not with us?

In the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, Peter doubts her relationship to Jesus. “Would he really have spoken intimately with a woman, and not with us? Why should we change our minds and listen to her?” This was the reason Jesus’ mission against the Roman rule in Judah and the uprising he instigated failed. The sectarian Jews were divided amongst themselves and he received support only from the Nazarenes and the Essene community. Out of self-interest, the Hebrew faction and the Sanhedrin (Council of Elders) withheld their support. They were content with their important positions within the Roman administration. In this manner, the Romans could restrain this troublesome part of their empire without much effort. They corrupted the religious leaders with power and money. This made it much more difficult for the people to revolt; tend to use an obscure system of control. Historian Flavius Josephus wrote in the year 70 that there were, among the Jews, several philosophical factions. The cultures of these communities differed greatly in many aspects. The Essenes were liberal and affectionate. They pursued mysticism and gnosis, believed in the Messiah and followed the teachings of the prophet Elijah. Their community bore a resemblance to a monastery. They practiced Egyptian healing and were therefore referred to as Therapeutae. The Nazarene community formed a subsect to the Essenes. Paul became one of their foremost leaders. When I read that Jesus had survived the crucifixion because of a scheme made up by James, and that his wounds were healed by Simon the Zealot (a magician), this agreed totally with a text I had read elsewhere. The text dealt with several discoveries made in southeastern France about the history of the Cathars. This text, and what I discovered during my trips to this region and the images that came to me there, confirm this scheme. More about this later. The Gospel of Mark was written in a period when the Jews revolted against the rule of the Roman Empire in 66 C.E. The Romans did not hesitate to kill rebels. Emperor Nero was unreliable and it is with good reason that he is often referred to as a cruel lunatic. Two years prior to this, Herod of Chalcis captured Peter and he was taken to Rome. Paul also fell into disgrace and was captured too. The Emperor Nero executed both. Peter was crucified upside down, according to his own wishes, because he wanted to show how the arrival of Jesus turned all relations upside down. At the same time, Paul was decapitated.

Many Catholics see Peter as the first pope, but this is complete nonsense. In the year 64, there was no such thing as a hierarchical Church. I am not surprised that people think like this. It just shows again that leaders of the Church misinformed their believers in many ways. During the 2nd century, Church Father Clemens of Alexandria confirmed these Roman cruelties. This meant that Mark had to express himself in a certain way, to make sure he would not come into conflict with the occupying forces. In order to survive he had no other option than to twist the truth! That led to the myth that Jesus lived in poverty and, for example, we are not told that he was fiercely against the Roman occupier. If Mark had written a truthful story, he would not have survived! The Gospel of Mark holds elements that are missing completely from the old Greek texts. When the New Testament was compiled, during the 4th century, this Gospel ended with chapter 16:8. This we can conclude from the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Sinaiticus, kept in the archives of the Vatican. The verses that have been added to chapter 16 are completely different in literary style. Mark 16:9 repeats the text of Luke 8:2 in a subtle way. The reader is reminded of the seven demons of Mary Magdalene and in this way the Church degrades her status of “apostle to the apostles’ once again. Mark 16:15 speaks of the apostles being sent to all corners of the world to spread the good news everywhere. This was a strategy meant to sideline Mary Magdalene and other women. In 1958 Morton Smith drew up a catalogue of the monastery in Mar Saba near Qumran. In a book written by Ignatius of Antioch from the first century, he discovered a letter that Church father, Clemens of Alexandria, had sent to his colleague Theodore. This letter contained a short version taken from the Gospel of Mark, which had been omitted since then from verse 16:9. This letter commissions Theodore to remove this part of the gospel and to keep silent about it, because it was not consistent with the course that had been agreed. These agreements had to do with the status of Mary Magdalene and with women in general.

The letter noted, If someone speaks the truth, we should not agree, because the truth, we now know from this faith, is the only truth. If it becomes known that things have been falsified, we should never admit that it is about the secret Gospel of Mark. It is better to deny this under oath, because not all that is true should be divulged to the people. The missing part of the gospel recounts that Roman governor Pontius Pilate had used state funds for his own purposes. He was charged in 32 C.E., but his soldiers killed the accusers. What followed was an armed revolt, led by Simon the Zealot. The revolt went amiss, and King Herod-Agrippa declared Simon an outlaw. According to Jewish law, this was much the same as a death sentence. The castaway would be undressed, placed in a shroud and confined to a crypt. Mary and Martha knew that if he was not pardoned (resurrected) within three days, then on the fourth day, the sentence would be executed, his soul cursed forever. Therefore, they sent the message to Jesus that Simon was ill. Jesus did not know what to do. He was powerless, because only a priest could perform a resurrection. Jesus then decided that he would take the role of a priest upon him and liberated Simon. During this period, dissension arose between Herod-Agrippa and the Roman authorities. Herod-Agrippa was forced to pass his legal power on to his uncle Herod-Antipas, who annulled Simon’s status of outlaw, for the simple reason that he had supported the revolt of the Zealots. Jesus had violated the rules, but Herod-Antipas forced the high priest to accept this fait accompli. People saw this as a miracle, because normally Jesus should have been put to death, following Jewish law. The high priest and the Pharisees did not accept that this breach of the rules went unpunished. From that moment on they consulted with each other, devising a way to kill Jesus. The difference between John and Mark is in the behavior of Mary Magdalene. John says, “When Mary Magdalene heard that Jesus was on the way, she went out to meet him.” The missing part of Mark states that Mary stayed at home, until Martha came to tell her that Jesus was asking for her. At that moment, she left her home and went to meet Jesus. From this text, it also becomes clear that Lazarus, friend of Jesus and subject of the story we know from the Bible, was the same person as Simon the Zealot, also known as Simon the Pharisee.

At that moment, she left her home and went to meet Jesus. From this text, it also becomes clear that Lazarus, friend of Jesus and subject of the story we know from the Bible, was the same person as Simon the Zealot, also known as Simon the Pharisee. According to Mark and Matthew, Mary Magdalene anointed Jesus in Bethania, in the home of Simon the Leper, former Pharisee. John mentions “in the home of Lazarus.” In this period, people commonly had several names or titles. This caused mix-ups later on, and the omitting of parts of the text in order to hide the truth only added to the confusion. In this way, it is clear that objectivity is nowhere to be found and that the current gospels cannot be considered reliable. Therefore, it is remarkable that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke elaborate on the Gospel of Mark, written by John Mark (a colleague of Paul) in 66 C.E. The Gospel of Luke originated in 80C.E . in Antioch and five years later, the Gospel of Matthew was drawn up in Corinth. It starts with, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” “The Word” referred to Jesus. In Acts 8:14 it says that the inhabitants of Samaria had accepted the Word of God, meaning that Jesus was at that time in Samaria. Acts 6:7 says, “So the Word of God spread,” meaning that more and more people listened to what Jesus had to say. Oddly enough, the wedding of Cana, where Jesus performed his first miracle by changing water into wine, can only be found in the Gospel of John. Jesus had no sympathy whatsoever for the strict religious beliefs of the Pharisees and he knew that the people of Judah could not be liberated from the Roman oppression unless they let go of their obstinate fanaticism. He also realized that they had been waiting for their prophesied holy man for a long time; a Messiah, who would deliver them from the Romans and herald a new era of liberation. As the heir of the House of King David, he definitely qualified for this and it would not have surprised anybody if he had claimed this role. He had revolutionary ideas and wanted to distance himself from the orthodox habits. Miracles are not necessarily paranormal events, but of course, they do count as special and unprecedented. It is confusing when you often encounter words that, purposely or not, have been translated wrongly. Knowing that biblical texts were subject to much falsification, to me it is safe to conclude that this was no accident.

In this case the word “dunameis” was mistranslated into “a miracle,” even though it refers to “an action of power,” which is sometimes equal to surprise. At the wedding of Cana, when Jesus had the opportunity to openly break with the convention for the first time, he hesitated and said, “My time has not come yet.” His mother brushed aside his lack of authority and told the servants “Do whatever he tells you to do, no matter what.” When the wine had nearly run out, Mary told her son about the shortage. Then it appears he changed water into wine. According to the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was the custom that serving wine was reserved for the priest in charge. Jesus had no priestly authority, so his dealing with the wine situation would mean a violation of this rule. Only fully initiated Levites were allowed to drink ceremonial wine. All others present were seen as uninitiated and could only do a ritual cleansing with water. Others included married men, converts, non-Jews and all non-priestly Jews. John 2:6 says, “Now there were six stone water jars for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.” Jesus broke with the tradition by ignoring the cleansing water and allowing the uninitiated guests to drink the holy wine. The master of ceremonies did not know where the wine came from, but he did not speak of a miracle. He made a remark about the good wine being served to the guests at that late stage of the party. Mary declared, this showed the greatness of Jesus, and his disciples believed in him. Cana was not about a wedding ceremony; in fact, it was an engagement meal. Some disciples attended and there were all kinds of guests. The official host, as the master of ceremonies, was in charge of the procedure and second in command were the groom and his mother. No guest ever had the right to give orders. Because of the fact that Jesus and his mother both gave orders to the servants, many theologians feel this proves that Jesus and the groom were the same person. How comes it Mary Magdalene was considered the most important of this group of women (the apostle to the apostles), her name always being mentioned first, if she is not Jesus’ wife? Why does this woman have the right to claim the body of Jesus (John20:15) if she is not related to him?

Why does this woman have the right to claim the body of Jesus (John20:15) if she is not related to him? Why would she take upon herself the task of anointing the body of Jesus, the task of a wife, if she is not his wife? From certain texts, we can conclude that the wedding in Cana was dated in June of the year 30 C.E. This dating is fitting for a dynastic engagement celebration, being three months before the first marriage in September. In September of this same year, Mary Magdalene anointed Jesus (the marriage ceremony) in the home of Simon. In this same period, she was also said to have wept for her husband (Luke 7:38), before being separated from him until November, according to the law. After that, she was referred to as “a crippled woman,” the term used for “a young woman who is engaged.” The only biblical reference to this can be found in the Gospel of John. At the crucifixion, Jesus appointed this “Beloved Disciple” as the one to take care of his mother. In this text, Mary Magdalene cannot be the subject, for it speaks of a man. In the text about the resurrection, on the way to the crypt, this same disciple appears together with Peter. Again, this excludes Mary Magdalene, for she spoke to this disciple. It is strange that the author of the Gospel of John was not clear about something so important. Yet, one passage shows that Jesus was very fond of one of his male disciples in particular, noted at the resurrection of Lazarus, “Jesus loved Mary, her sister Martha, and Lazarus very much.” After the resurrection, the Jews present said, “He loved him so much.” The author of the Book of Revelation is introduced as John the Apostle; however, the text is anonymous, not from the same hand as Revelation and was not written by the author of the Epistles of John. The author of the gospel knew many details, was informed about many priestly customs, and had a close relationship to Jesus. At the end, it says that the source of all this information is “the disciple Jesus loved, although he is not the author.” In John 21:24 it says: “This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.” Therefore, this is not the testimony of John, but that of Simon the Zealot, who first supplied the information to the author of this gospel.

The story itself provides some information as to the identity of the author. In all four Gospels Mary Magdalene is present at Jesus’ crypt. She was the only one who had to be there, in order to anoint her husband. Contrary to the other gospels, this document states that she was alone at the crypt. It also describes the personal conversation between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Apart from these two, nobody else was present, so one of them must be the author. Therefore, Mary Magdalene has to be the author of this gospel, unless it was Jesus himself. During the 4th century, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, following his own judgment, selected writings that, in his opinion, matched very well. A short while after this, Pope Damasus I commissioned the Roman Church scholar Jerome to check these texts, written in Latin, and to make sure they were consistent. This resulted in Jerome making more than 3500 alterations in the texts of the Old and New Testaments. He also commissioned monks to write new material, to fill up the gaps. After this forgery, the texts were submitted to the Council of Hippo in 393 and that of Carthage in 397. Everything had been prepared in detail. Because of the strategy that was taken, approval by both councils was no more than a formality. In fact, they laid the foundation for the Bible as we know it, the so-called infallible Word of God. It is important to know if they indeed crucified Jesus, and if so, whether he died while on the cross. I can imagine Jesus being crucified, but I have always had my doubts about him dying on the cross. Especially when I found out that documents had been discovered in France, which contain direct evidence that Jesus lived in France and died there. This confirmed my suspicions and took away my doubts. Based on the existing story from the New Testament, the only possible conclusion is that it is a deceit. In the Gospels, Jesus was depicted as a non-political person.

In the Gospels, Jesus was depicted as a non-political person. The only possible reason for the Romans to put him to death is if he conducted a crime against them, but the evangelists tell us that he abided by the law as decreed by the occupying forces. We know the orthodox Jews were ill-disposed toward him, but if he was condemned according to Jewish law, he could only be stoned. The details of the crucifixion, for example, had to be described as the Old Testament had predicted them. Church Father Jerome took care of this, let there be no doubt about that. The forgers omitted certain details and twisted texts around in order to make the story consistent. In those days, the great majority did not speak up for themselves (without risking terrible consequences) and were illiterate, so it was easy to make them believe anything. Scientists are clearly divided about the crucifixion. It has been ascertained, from the many investigations into his historical character, that Jesus was indeed crucified by the Romans because he spoke against their dominion. This sort of resistance, organized meetings, and outright rebellion were punished with flogging and/or crucifixion. The Gospel of John gives a detailed report of the crucifixion – and therefore it seems more reliable than the other three. It says for example that Jesus had thirst and was offered a sponge drenched in vinegar, which was brought to his mouth on a pike. Vinegar, among its many qualities, was used medicinally to revive people who had fainted. However, Jesus reacted in a completely different manner. He spoke some last words and seemed to pass away. The fact that they wanted to break Jesus’ legs was a sign of impatience – he had a pedestal under his feet. If he had hung only by his wrists, he would have suffocated in minutes. Joseph of Arimathea, however, enjoyed great privileges from the Romans. Because the crucifixion took place on his own terrain, he intervened and prevented the breaking of Jesus’ legs. What was really soaked into that sponge? In those days, anesthetic drugs like belladonna and opium were readily available. Joseph of Arimathea may have chosen one of these to make the Romans believe Jesus was dead, and get permission to take him from the cross, all facilitated by the fact that the crucifixion took place on his own land. The apostles, it seems, were not in on the caper. They, too, believed that Jesus was dead – and it saved his life. Joseph of Arimathea helped fulfill the old scriptures, in the same way Church Father Jerome has done. Jesus had to rise from death after three days. It is obvious that the crucifixion did not take place on Golgotha, for this is a bare hill shaped like a skull, to the northeast of Jerusalem.

It is obvious that the crucifixion did not take place on Golgotha, for this is a bare hill shaped like a skull, to the northeast of Jerusalem. The Gospel of John states that the site of the crucifixion was a garden of olive trees. By adding the name Golgotha and twisting some words, the story becomes completely different. The Book of Revelation 11:8 states that Jesus was crucified in “the great city that is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt.” The Therapeutae called Qumran “Egypt” and this place was geographically associated with the town of Sodom. In the Gospel of Mark, we find that he was “a prominent councilor (a member of the Sanhedrin), who also expected the arrival of the Kingdom of God.” According to John he was “a secret disciple of Jesus, for he feared the Jews.” Yet his connection to Jesus was not surprising to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. He granted Joseph permission, without question, to take Jesus’ body down from the cross and place it in the family crypt. Aside from that, Jesus’ mother, his sisters Mary and Sarah-Salome and Mary Magdalene all agreed to the way Joseph took care of things. Jesus was successor to the throne in the line of David, so he was referred to as “the David.” The title “the Joseph” was assigned to the successor who was then next in line to the throne. When a dynastic son from the House of Judah became the David (king) , his oldest son became “the Joseph.” If at this time he had no son, or if his son was younger than sixteen, the eldest brother of the David was given the title of Joseph, which he would then pass on when the son had reached the required age. James was the oldest of Jesus’ younger brothers and this is why he became the Joseph ha Rama Theo, which was transposed into Joseph of Arimathea. Simon the Zealot, who was after all a magician, had installed himself inside the crypt to take care of Jesus. John 19:39 states that Nicodemus arrived next, with “a mixture of myrrh and aloe, some hundred litra.” Extract of myrrh helps to calm a person down and aloe juice is a fast-working purging agent. This was exactly what Simon needed in order to dispel the poison from Jesus’ body. It is important to note that the day after the crucifixion was the Sabbath.

The timing of Jesus’ revival depended on the exact time in which the Sabbath started. In those days, there were twelve hours in the day and twelve hours in the night, but time had to be adjusted when the days/ nights became longer or shorter. That Friday, time had to be adjusted by three hours (ahead). This makes for a discrepancy between the reports of Mark and John. Mark follows the solar system and John uses the lunar system. The key is in these three missing hours – the daytime hours were turned into nighttime hours. The Samaritan wise men used an astronomical timetable and changed the time three hours later. In this way, Simon had three full hours at his disposal to care for Jesus, without having to violate the rules that prohibited working on the Sabbath. What kind of woman would not immediately want to kiss and hold her husband, seeing him alive when she thought he was dead? However, Jesus ordered her not to embrace him. This meant that Mary Magdalene was pregnant, because physical contact between husband and wife during pregnancy was not allowed at that time. After the conviction of Jesus, the Romans managed to regain control over the rebellious province of Judah. The Roman emperor had done all within his power to bend the religious leaders of the Jews to his will. He made sure they felt important by offering them positions of authority, for instance, as “Councillor to the King of Jerusalem.” During the reign of King Herod-Agrippa I in the year 43, his councillors decided that all followers of Jesus were revolutionaries. They misled the king by warning him that this movement was dangerous and that the group intended to overthrow the priests of the temple, who acted as the legal authorities. This was the cause for the first persecutions of Jesus’ followers. The king took severe action and captured and punished many people. Simon’s assault had everything to do with an uprising he had conducted in the year 32, against Pontius Pilate. Because of this, Herod-Agrippa I declared him an outlaw. The members of the Sanhedrin and the Roman authorities, both having played an important role in the prosecution and conviction of Jesus, searched for Simon and held suspicions with regard to his kindred spirits.

She was a relative of Simon as well as a fellow believer and was suspected of having joined the Zealots. Mary Magdalene, who was married to Jesus, had to give birth to a family heir in order to maintain the line of descent of David. She was successful, for her second child was a son. After this birth and the prescribed period of separation, Jesus and Mary continued their marriage in December of 43 AD. She fell pregnant for the third time and soon after, in the spring of 44, Jesus left for Galatia (a Roman province in Asia Minor). He left because the Jewish tradition prescribed married people to live apart during pregnancy and for a certain period following the birth. The important proselyte (someone who is converted to Judaism) John Mark travelled with him. Since Peter was Jesus’ right-hand man, he would have to act as protector of Mary Magdalene during the time of their separation. Despite the fact that Peter himself was married, he despised women and was not prepared to wait hand and foot on a priestess who challenged his authority. He prevented Mary Magdalene from reaching a position of any importance in Antioch. Herod-Agrippa II (a former pupil of Paul) protected Mary and this is how they arranged their passage to Herod’s country estate near Vienne, north of Marseille. Simon the Zealot led the company that, among others, consisted of the pregnant Mary Magdalene and her two children, Sarah-Tamar and Jesus, and some wealthy ladies we could call ladies-in-waiting. This company arrived in Gaul and the Queen of Marseille welcomed them. In 1526, Pera Matas splendidly captured this event in a painting. In the Provence, one can find many religious works of art, depicting the boat journey of Mary Magdalene, as well as her speaking to the local residents. Imperial documents, stemming from the time before the Roman Church originated, mention the Greek word “Desposyni,” a word that was reserved only for those who were related to Jesus. Father Malachi Martin, a Jesuit, who worked in the Vatican at the beginning of the 20th century, confirmed this later. During his studies there, he discovered the many lies by the Church after which he left the Society of Jesus in 1964 and turned his back on the Church completely.

Nevertheless, despite the confusion that arose around the crucifixion of Jesus and the persecution by the Romans, more and more people embraced Jesus’ teachings, which resulted in a large group of followers. They organized meetings in Rome and kept their faith alive in the catacombs. In Rome, and throughout the Empire, they formed groups and conducted their ceremonies in secret. The apostles and their pupils, who had known Jesus in person, took the lead. They organized and maintained the contacts between the different groups. Due to their stubborn intransigence, the Romans sometimes persecuted the christiani ruthlessly and committed many atrocities. Many followers were executed, forced to fight the gladiators in the Roman Colosseum, or were literally thrown to the lions, gruesome atrocities that were unprecedented in religious matters. In these early days, we find all kinds of symbols and allegories. (An allegory is a symbol that hides its true meaning.) They were metaphors, used to protect the early Christians from the Romans. The vine, for instance, was used as a symbol of life and growth, but also of the family tree. The vine brought forth the grape. In the Bible, this is a metaphor for “go forth and multiply.” Jesus stated that he was the true vine and continued the line of David, because he was the successor to the throne. From his youth Constantine learned about Christianity, in which he showed more and more interest. This interest does not justify the conclusion that he identified with the Christian belief system, because he did not organize his own baptism until he was on his deathbed. Nevertheless, he credited his victories to the god of the christiani. In October 312, Constantine defeated his rival Maxentius in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, which lay to the north of Rome. This conquest made him the unrivalled ruler of the West. Four months later, he declared his “Edict of Tolerance” in Milan, which gave the christiani, among others, total freedom to practice their religion. He was a political genius. The new emperor understood that the empire would be wrecked by the endless struggle against the followers of Jesus. From that moment on, the persecution and punishing of the christiani ended. The new emperor did not capitulate to Christianity, he provided freedom to the Christians only in order to abuse this situation later on. Therefore, he had to maintain strict control.

The emperor garlanded the bishops with gold and upgraded their function enormously. By doing this, he made them dependent and submissive. The bishops looked up to the emperor and felt very flattered. The church authorities of those days embraced the freedom and wealth they received from Constantine. Sylvester followed Constantine’s directions and did not develop any initiatives of his own. Of course, the emperor welcomed this situation, because he was determined to turn Christianity into a valuable political instrument. Constantine left religious problems to the courts of the Church, to which he gave the same authority as the civilian courts. Sylvester had no say in certain important matters. This became clear when a Desposyni delegation came to Rome to pay a visit to the bishop. Their spokesman, Joseph, explained to Sylvester that Jerusalem was the center of the Church, not Rome. On top of that, Bishop Clemens of Alexandria had announced that in the second century, James (brother of Jesus), the Nazarene Bishop of Jerusalem, should be seen as “the Lord of the Holy Church” and that he was the “bishop of all bishops.” In addition, the bishops of Antioch, Ephesus and Alexandria also had to be a real heritable Desposyni. This Jewish-Christian movement had more authority than an invented Roman side-branch originating from Peter. He was simply an apostle of Jesus, not a family member. Sylvester responded that he was not authorized to repeal the imperial orders of Constantine. By order of the emperor, the teachings of Jesus had been replaced by a doctrine. He thought this was better for the common people and of course, it suited his own purposes much better. In his view, it was he who had liberated the people, not Jesus. The truth of the matter is, however, that Sylvester was never present at important meetings. Not even when the emperor called together all bishops for the first grand ecumenical council in Nicaea in 325. Sylvester had just two priests delegated to this council, which was a wonderful spectacle. About 300 bishops participated, all transported by state carriages. Constantine himself presided over the meeting, but he limited himself to maintaining control. He had based the monopoly of the state on the Christian faith and it was therefore not in his interest that they were divided amongst themselves.

The discord had, however, already started in Alexandria and concerned the dogma of the Trinity. Priest Arius was an ascetic man with grey hair who stood in high regard at the caste of the “Virgins.” His vision on the Trinity was, “contrary to the Father and the Spirit, Jesus was no God, but an ordinary human being, who had been born from the union between a man and a woman.” This view spread from 313 and many bishops in the Eastern Church shared it. As a result, two factions emerged, the followers of Arius, and the supporters of traditional dogma. The priests issued this Creed to their followers and everybody simply had to obey. The text of the Creed is much longer than I describe here, but the core of it is, “I believe in one God, the almighty Father, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God of God, light of light, true God of true God, begotten, not made.” Constantine was an inventive man who claimed to have seen an illuminated cross. Later on, he even said that Jesus was to blame for the fact that his followers were now in a vulnerable position. Because he had given them freedom, Constantine was their true Savior, not Jesus. He simply pushed the Son of God aside! The emperor claimed the title “Messiah of the Christians” and did all within his power to be regarded as such. Since Jesus was no longer alive, the emperor could even claim the title of “Born again Messiah,” as he knew that the Christians awaited the miraculous return of their messiah, Jesus. In this way, Constantine created a new concept, a myth, with his own messianic message. Emperor Constantine managed to place himself above the relatives of Jesus because the bishops executed his wishes faultlessly. They made sure the new policy was seen as the one and only true religion, given to Constantine by God himself, and claimed that what the Desposyni and the Nazarene brotherhood taught was impure, objectionable and heretic. In the end, the Nazarene brotherhood was crushed by the new, official state religion of Rome. This new reality became irreversible.

Since the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Roman emperors saw themselves as Gods on Earth and Constantine went the extra mile. He knew better than anyone, that in order to gain even more power and status, he had to make the people believe in something that was out of reach. That is why he made Jesus “Son of God.” We now know this is a distortion of the facts. From old writings, especially the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is apparent that any person who lived according to God’s law, was considered a “Son of the Divine Principle.” I wonder how Jesus would have felt, if he knew he was the only one to be called “Son of God.” I think he would have hated that, for it is the opposite of his teachings and doctrines. The term “Son of God” is a metaphor stemming from the antique world, used to confirm the bond between God and the human being. The powerful elite of this earth made use of this title and people held them in high esteem in accordance with their rank. The idea of “Son of God” was good in the general sense. This tradition goes far back in history; for instance, to Egypt, where every pharaoh was the son of their god Osiris. The way people thought in antiquity has been the subject of much research. The Egyptians were familiar with the idea of resurrection and life after death. That was one of the focuses of their religious beliefs. Death brings forth new life, just as spring does in nature. They believed that the deceased had to appear before “the tribunal of the last judgment.” He or she would stand in front of the door that led to the hall of the absolute truth, where Osiris sat on his throne. Osiris lived on earth as a god in human form and taught the people how they should serve and worship God. He brought civilization, but his opponents (evil) killed him. After that, he was resurrected and ascended to heaven, where he would perform the last judgment. The Egyptians believed that Osiris was visible in the sky as the star of Orion. People saw all other stars as the souls of the deceased and Orion guarded them as a good shepherd. This was not the only mythical image that preceded and was adapted in the later concepts of Christianity. Dionysos was literally transformed into “Son of God” and “Saviour of all People.” He was depicted as a divine child, resting on his mother’s lap, in the same way", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:33:43f8e7d507eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 953, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "Egyptians believed that Osiris was visible in the sky as the star of Orion.

Dionysos was literally transformed into “Son of God” and “Saviour of all People.” He was depicted as a divine child, resting on his mother’s lap, in the same way Jesus was depicted on Mary’s lap. And the parallels continue! Dionysos was worshipped with bread and wine, in remembrance of his sacrificial death on a rough wooden stake. He was resurrected and ascended to heaven, just like Osiris. In the documentary The Son of God, broadcast by Discovery Channel in 2003, scientists show that the Church of San Clemente in Rome was built on the foundations of a heathen temple. According to the Roman Church, the heathen ceremonies and rituals that took place there were so appalling to the followers of Jesus, that they erased all their traces. But it is quite remarkable that even in this old temple a savior was worshipped, called Mithras, who, like Jesus, was born from a virgin mother on December 25 and was called “Son of God.” He ascended to heaven and would return, in order to judge the living as well as the dead. On the images, heathen priests symbolically celebrate with bread and wine, to honor their savior. The teachings that were attributed to him were as follows, “Whomever does not drink my blood, will not receive salvation!” Jesus was elevated to a divinity and, in the biblical stories, they described him challenging the religious leaders and performing miracles such as changing water into wine. They said he was born from a virgin, died on the cross and rose from the dead at Easter before ascending to heaven. Then the Holy Spirit was poured out over humanity and Jesus’ sacrifice brought about the salvation of everybody who adhered to the Christian dogma. The writers that took the story literally, spoke of “imitation by the devil, who had deceived the Egyptian, Greek and Roman people.” By putting the blame on the convenient devil, a foundation was made for the idea that he had brought the peoples of the Earth into confusion. The authorities of the Roman Church made sure everything was in accordance with their mythical story. In the 4th century, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote about the life of Anthony the Hermit. In his book, he mentions that Anthony battled with the astral forces in his soul. Rome disapproved of this because it was not consistent with their view – Athanasius should have mentioned that Anthony battled with the devil! That would have placed these experiences outside reality, when in fact they had to do with the human struggle of Anthony.

That would have placed these experiences outside reality, when in fact they had to do with the human struggle of Anthony. On top of that, certain Greek words were falsely translated. For instance, the Hebrew word Chahenna was translated as hell, but some research shows that Chahenna was simply the name of the dumping ground outside the city walls of Jerusalem, the place where waste burns and lepers live. Even now, a part of that town bears the name Chahenna. The word virgin is also mis-translated. Although there is no proof they did this on purpose, this mistake was repeated so often that it makes us think. In the Greek translation (the Septuagint) of the Jewish Bible, they translated “almah” (young woman) as virgin. In Hebrew, a virgin is “bethulah,” a very different word. A virgin and a young woman are not necessarily the same. From the 4th century onward, writers had no choice but to support what Constantine had established. The Christians, who believed this fabrication, literally celebrated their victory by claiming the heathen concepts had become uninteresting and inferior, with the aim to make Constantine’s Official State Christianity victorious. On the other hand, people kept their old religious concepts alive and were not prepared to give these up easily. They called everybody who was not a Christian a heathen. The Christians originally used this as a term of abuse, not unlike “clodhopper.” They labeled Greek playwrights like Euripides and Sophocles, and the philosophers of the ancient world, as primitive and superstitious farmers. However, when you study these so-called farmers, you will find out that the core of their spiritual thinking contained a rich, mystical philosophy which formed the foundations of the best elements of our Western culture. We cannot dismiss this spirituality as a primitive form of idolatry or dim thinking. On the contrary, the ancient Greek way of thinking was highly evolved. The questions that occupied their minds were “Who am I? What is my purpose? What is the deeper meaning of my existence?” Plato, for instance, saw the human being as a mental prisoner within his physical existence. They depicted Emperor Constantine as an atrocious persecutor of the Christians. He had become a leper and sought to be cured by the gods.

They depicted Emperor Constantine as an atrocious persecutor of the Christians. He had become a leper and sought to be cured by the gods. Their advice to him was to bathe himself in the blood of newborn babies, but when he was about to kill a baby, the desperate mother managed to hold him back. During the following night, Peter and Paul appeared to him in a dream. In order to find healing, he had to apply to the Bishop of Rome. Voila! Sylvester instructed him in the catechesis, and, after he was immersed in the baptismal water, he came out completely healed. In 598, the Council of Toledo introduced the concept that the Holy Spirit is “from the Father and from the Son.” This theological point of discussion divided Christianity into two factions. Because there was no more Western emperor in power at this time, an alternative East-Roman Church developed from its Byzantine base. This Church held to the belief that the Holy Spirit stems “from the Father through the Son.” From the beginning, the Church fathers were endemically afraid of women, and in particular of Mary Magdalene. This is why they produced a false document, the Apostolic Church Order, a fictional discussion amongst the apostles. It stated that Mary and Martha were present during the Last Supper, but Jesus did not offer the bread and cup to them, because Mary was laughing. This is why the first apostles decided women could not become priests: they were frivolous, not to be considered seriously! The Church adopted this lie as official dogma and they described Mary Magdalene as unfaithful and disobedient. The Church made diligent use of Paul, portraying him as a man who apparently had an aversion to women. The quotes were chosen very carefully and taken out of context. There is a contradiction in Paul’s comments. Sometimes he draws individual attention to his female assistants and praises them for their work, but in other cases, he prohibits them from holding religious office and even attending a service. It is obvious that the Church Fathers chose the fragments that best fitted their interests and ignored the rest. Since the original letters no longer exist, we will never know the literal texts, or whether Paul was even the author. After the 4th century, the appreciation of women reached a historic nadir, which went on for centuries. During the Middle Ages, Church Fathers Albertus Magnus and Thomas of Aquino adapted the teachings in a most peculiar and even more sanctioned way. They felt that woman was a monstrosity, a failure.

He could not care less how his male disciples felt about this. Peter’s envy of his female fellow-thinker runs parallel to how men saw women in later ages. Albertus Magnus writes at one point that women are less rational than men are. According to him, a woman consists of relatively more fluid. Fluid moves easily, which makes women unstable and curious. He stated that a woman show no loyalty, because when she has sexual intercourse with a man, she wants to be with another man at the same time. Every woman, in his opinion, is a failed man and has a flawed nature, which makes them insecure. What they did to women in general, through the ages, is truly horrible. The Church’s fear of women was so strong, that any who were seen as a threat were condemned as witches, ostracized, tortured, and often burnt on pyres. Shamelessly, the Church Fathers used intimidation, manipulation and narcissism in order to destroy the self-esteem of women. This is why, as a psychological therapist, I regularly meet women who still suffer this trauma. As long as academics, from their cognitive knowledge, do not want to open up and see that a person goes through several life processes, the suppression of women will never cease. It is not just the burden that a woman carries. In this way, men will never recognize the origin of the engrained viewpoints that they carry with them. In the early years of Christianity, sects came into being that banned sexuality. They experienced a dualism between the body and the mind and felt continence was the answer. In the 2nd century an elite group of “virginal adherents” came into being. In the 3rd century, a number of priests tended to cease all sexual intercourse with their wives. In the 4th century, during the Council of Elvira in Spain, the bishops accepted the first legal obligation concerning sexual continence. Bishop Paphnuce found this approach was too rigorous. He felt this would open the door to the loss of moral values, because when nature is constrained it will look for compensation. That is why, in his opinion, marital life is always preferable to secret relationships. Within the Roman Church, it took a long time before the clergymen generally accepted this rule of celibacy.

It was not until the 11th century that priests were obliged to send their wives away. In Rome, they went even further: the pope took wives away from their husbands to work for him as slaves in the Lateran Palace! Despite the prescribed celibacy, most popes and bishops felt free to be flexible with this rule. They enjoyed sexually extravagant lifestyles in the privacy of their halls of power, apparently unashamed. The Vatican became a meeting place where clergy could come together with male prostitutes and courtesans (high-class prostitutes). The pope and bishops kept these women as their mistresses. Because they moved in the highest circles, they were extremely wealthy and lived lives of great luxury. The women associated themselves with the biblical Mary Magdalene (whom the Church, after all, called a whore) and had themselves painted as a repentant Mary Magdalene. The pope and bishops permitted themselves to make use of these women and, conveniently, this was no problem, as long as both the clergy and the courtesans showed repentance repeatedly about their actions. To donate by a repentant Mary Magdalene, the sinners gained absolution. An “Official” absolution was born, and the sinners adorned lavishly many churches and chapels. From the earliest monastic times, there was a constant rivalry and enmity between the monks and the orthodox clergy. The lavish lifestyle of the worldly lords was in sharp contrast with the harsh and ascetic, monastic lifestyle. The monks also showed great discipline in their work, for instance in preserving, assembling and copying historical documents. They would not allow themselves to be influenced by political propaganda or ecclesiastical dogma. In 1622, Pope Gregory XV introduced the Sacra Congregatio Propaganda Fide (Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), in which he imposed the doctrines as obligatory dogma. The pope founded this “College of Cardinals devoted to the spreading of the faith” with its task to ruthlessly enforce obedience to the Church dogma. Teachers and officially approved historians duly hammered the propaganda home, especially when it was inconsistent with the traditional lore or documented facts. The acceptance of an authority that cannot be mistaken in matters of faith and tradition is dangerous and misleading but, nevertheless, a logical keystone of the structure of the Roman Catholic Church. So far, they have applied the new dogma of infallibility only once, in 1950, and it concerned an aspect of Mariology.

[Six years later, the Vatican Council reconfirmed this third element], Whoever claims that the dogma of the Church could ever be enlightened by science in a way that our religion would have to be amended: anathema sit. If God does exist, he, she, it, or all of the above, is no human being, but a spiritual, all-embracing energy that is seemingly inexhaustible. This is consistent with science, because life is built up from various forms of energy. That makes complete nonsense of the idea that an inexhaustible force must rest on the seventh day. In Genesis, we read that Adam and Eve were the first human beings, and Cain and Abel were their sons. Genesis 4 adds a third son, called Seth. So, how did Cain, who, after killing Abel over the somewhat trivial matter of whose sacrifice had more favor with God, went to live in the Land of Nod, have intercourse with his wife and beget children? Where did she suddenly come from? There is no mention anywhere that Adam and Eve had a daughter. It became more and more clear to me that Revelation was in fact a chronological continuation of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. A number of Epistles of Paul and Peter have been placed in between and they are quite dominant, for the simple reason that the Roman Church is based upon their dogma. The Church was not based on Jesus’ teachings, contrary to the original “Christianism.” This scripture is exactly what it claims to be, a revelation concerning the exile of Mary Magdalene and the imperial persecution of her offspring. John explains, how a woman who wore the crown of Sophia (the crown of twelve stars), fled into the wilderness to get away from the imperial dragon, who wanted to “battle against the rest of her offspring, together with all those who keep God’s commandments and stayed truthful to the testimony of Jesus.” He mentions the woman was pregnant when she fled: “she was pregnant and cried out in her contractions and labor pains.” Mary Magdalene was indeed pregnant when she and other family members took flight to Gaul. In the Christian tradition of that time, Mary Magdalene represented Sophia (the Greek goddess of wisdom). In the medieval tradition of France and Flanders, Mary Magdalene was called “Notre Dame de Lumière” (Our Lady of the Light) and she was sometimes depicted with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:39:e20b14a13125", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 959, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "Jesus.” He mentions the woman was pregnant when she fled: “she was pregnant and cried out in her contractions and labor pains.” Mary Magdalene was indeed pregnant when she and other family members took flight to Gaul. In the Christian tradition of that time, Mary Magdalene represented Sophia (the Greek goddess of wisdom). In the medieval tradition of France and Flanders, Mary Magdalene was called “Notre Dame de Lumière” (Our Lady of the Light) and she was sometimes depicted with a halo of twelve stars. He further relates that the liberation of the Desposyni, the offspring of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, meant they could maintain their bloodline, despite the persecutions they had to face. “Because the persecutor of our brothers and sisters, who kept complaining about them to God, has been brought down. They have overcome him, thanks to the blood of the lamb and thanks to their testimonies.” According to the dogma of the Church, the consecutive weddings in Revelation refer to the wedding of Jesus Christ with the Christian Church. However, there was still no Church when the Apostle John wrote this! The facts were twisted. Here we have a report of an esoteric nature of the family history of the Messiah. Daughter Tamar (Damaris in Greek) married Paul in 53, in Athens. By this marriage, Paul became Jesus’ son in law. Church Fathers turned Paul into another character in order to prevent this connection from being known. That is why it is not strange that the later theologians never knew what to make of Paul as the Bible portrayed him. They used to call him “l’enfant terrible” (annoying young person), because his statements and how he is described, do not correspond to the other texts. His son, Jesus III, was born in 77 AD and became later “the Alfa and the Omega.” This was a Sadducean title of the House of Herod, which was transferred to the House of David in 102, when the power of this dynasty came to an end. He married in 113, with the words: “I am the descendant of David, his offspring, the radiant Morning Star” (Revelation 22:16). Revelation 16:16 predicts that the great deciding battle between light and darkness (good and evil) will take place in Armageddon (Har Megiddo) meaning Mount of Megiddo, an important Palestinian battlefield, where a military fort was located. It guarded the Plain of Jezreel, south of the hills of Galilee. In the War Scroll (part of the Dead Sea Scrolls), we find a detailed report of the battle that was predicted between the children of the light and the sons of darkness, in the great battle of Har Megiddo. On one side were the tribes of Israel and on the other side the Romans and several heathen parties.

On one side were the tribes of Israel and on the other side the Romans and several heathen parties. It was a fierce battle, fought between the light, symbolized by Israel and the darkness of the Roman Empire. The Roman Church took over and adapted this old concept. The battle of Har Megiddo was disengaged from its specific location and adapted to a worldwide scale. Rome took symbolic possession of “the light” for its own use from the day on which Emperor Constantine appointed himself as the leader of Christianity. A decree was issued, saying that the Day of Judgment had not yet arrived, and the bishops approved this decree. The faithful, accepting the revised Principle, were promised entrance to the Heavenly Kingdom. They gave the former hill fort of Har Megiddo a supernatural dimension and Armageddon got a frightening connotation. It implied the horrific end of everything – and the only sure way of deliverance was absolute obedience to the Church of Rome. This turned out to be one of the most cunning maneuvers in history, until the truth about Armageddon became known, in 1947. From this perspective, it became very clear to me, that also in this case the pitcher goes so often to the well that it comes home broken at last. In the Catholic Church, there has always been criticism from within. For instance, the Reformation came about because Luther took a position against the existing dogmas and corrupt practices. In the whole of Church history, we see that if somebody made critical comments, they were regarded as a heretic and silenced by intimidation or pitiless punishment. Even within monasteries and abbeys, opinions were divided. During the time of Luther, Rome was the religious stock exchange. Simony (selling religious goods and functions) and nepotism (the practice of favoring relatives or friends by giving them positions) were common practice within the churchly hierarchy. When Pope Julius II (called “il terribile” with reason) ruled, the Vatican was the center of sexual extravagance and the whole town was a market selling devotional items. In Rome, Luther went piously on pilgrimage from one church to the other, earning indulgences everywhere and looking at the relics in awe. However, this complete disorder and blatant spiritual fraud disgusted him, and he openly condemned these practices. He also objected to the “community of saints”; the whole “hocus-pocus,” which is now no longer in existence. Hocus-pocus is an expression that exists in all European countries; derived from the Latin consecration text, Jesus is supposed to have spoken these words during the Last Supper: “Hoc est corpus (This is my body).” When", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:41:13f1a21aaaa0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 961, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "earning indulgences everywhere and looking at the relics in awe.

Hocus-pocus is an expression that exists in all European countries; derived from the Latin consecration text, Jesus is supposed to have spoken these words during the Last Supper: “Hoc est corpus (This is my body).” When spoken quickly it sounds like hocus-pocus and is usually accompanied by the additional words “Pilatus pas,” the next words of the Creed. Luther wanted to return to simplicity, using biblical texts as his basis, and be delivered from the Roman Catholic dogmas. Alas, Luther did not realize these texts were not even based on true history. It all started with the French Revolutionaries, who chastised the Church for its lies, superstitions and intrigues, and its unholy league with the French Court. Apart from that, great thinkers like Spinoza, Newton and Voltaire put pressure on the Church by challenging the dogma it proclaimed and brilliantly articulating their doubts. These and others are the founders of The Enlightenment and the freedom of thought that followed. From all of this, it is obvious that the Catholic Church has theologically and willfully abused the wealth of Jesus’ legacy and nullified it, simply out of self-interest. History shows that people in power have systematically destroyed the inner truth of spiritual revelations. They replace it with an invented religion, with rules and laws and many limitations, designed to perpetuate their dominion; when in fact the most important thing is inner knowledge, an inexhaustible source of great wisdom. This is what Jesus wanted to teach us. Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church has been an organization in which one man pulls all the strings. Ever since the Congregations of Cardinals was introduced, (the Roman Curia, the administrative office of the pope) this authority has been more widely spread; nevertheless, the Church is still a closed and non-transparent fortress. Its secret service, “Opus Dei” has at its disposal great international networks that extend to all layers of society. These networks not only consist of representatives and ambassadors, but also of groups that are less distinguished. The Church never hesitated to engage itself with criminal organizations like the Mafia. In this respect, it bears close resemblance to a worldly dictatorship. Its position of power was acquired by fraudulent actions, intimidation and threats, even towards the worldly authorities. The Church wanted at a certain moment to increase its status and reached this by blending the name of Jesus with their institute. They fabricated false illustrations and documents with regard to former emperors and popes. For example, it was recorded that Emperor Constantine had received the privilege of calling himself the “Savior of all people,” from Jesus himself.

For example, it was recorded that Emperor Constantine had received the privilege of calling himself the “Savior of all people,” from Jesus himself. The Christian community started to take the legend of Sylvester seriously. It turned out to be one of the greatest deceptions of the last thousand years of church history. In the eighth century, Pope Zachary had a completely fabricated document made up, allegedly in the handwriting of Emperor Constantine and signed by him: “The Donation of Constantine.” In this supposedly four-hundred-year-old document, it was recorded that Jesus himself appointed the pope and assigned him as his replacement on earth. In this way, the pope built a strong foundation to support all previous illustrations and documents. It was a master forgery, which later popes also used to support their authority and augment their worldly possessions. They completely lost sight of the fact that Jesus had said, “My Kingdom is not of this world.” On the basis of this falsification, the popes started to act like rulers. They even felt that kings were inferior to them, because The Donation of Constantine conveniently stated that God had transferred the power and authority of all dynasties to the pope. This changed the structure of the monarchy. From then on, the pope crowned the European sovereigns and thus they were not only kings but also servants of the Church, instead of servants of the people. This is the origin of the dictatorship within this Catholic institution, which managed to abuse its power for centuries. The first initiative that Pope Zachary took was to dethrone the Merovingian royal family in France. The Merovingians were direct descendants of Jesus and his relatives. For 300 years, this dynasty had ruled Gaul. In accordance with their descent, these sovereigns wore their hair long and organized their principality and court according to the example of King Solomon. In 480, King Clovis had made a peace treaty with the Roman Church, but this was rendered useless after 751. The kings of the Desposyni dynasties in England and France lived as fathers and servants of the people, and never as their rulers. They were the protectors of the people and their citizens were called sons and daughters of the king. This is in strong contrast to the territorial kingship, a feudal and imperialistic concept that stemmed from the fraudulent document of Pope Zachary. The monarchy of the Merovingians was exclusively dynastic. The hereditary succession was looked upon as an automatic and holy right. The Church had no say in this.

Nevertheless, this pure tradition was abolished when Rome took the opportunity to create kings by means of a fake papal law. People were abused on a grand scale, because they were powerless and illiterate. The Church used the military arm of the privileged class, and cleared the road for indoctrination, intimidation and manipulation. The Roman Church is guilty of all three. The faithful believed the threat that, if they did not abide by the dogma, they would spend hundreds or thousands of years in purgatory after death. In severe cases, they would even burn in hell forever. This evil came to be in the ages when Church and State were interwoven. Let us hope that these two powers will never come together again, because history taught us that, when Church and state are not separated, fanaticism reigns and negative forces come forth which we cannot fathom. Even today, we see this result in the endless Middle Eastern conflicts. In the Early and Late Middle Ages, people had few choices in life. The class structure was rigid. Faith and ethics were established in a system of dogma and regulations, and all opinions that differed were considered to be heretic. A heretic was by definition an enemy of the Church. Because Church and State were one, the religious heretic was also an enemy of society. Disobedience had great consequences; so many people simply did as was expected of them. By this fear, we forget to listen to our inner voice and thereby be ourselves. The churchly institute was dictatorial and did not shy away from the use of violence. Its authorities were arrogant and hypocritical. When somebody refused to accept the faith and subject themselves to the ecclesiastical dogma, the consequence was torture, often ending in death. They practiced this abuse of power for over a thousand years. Despite the fact that the Roman Church no longer has any worldly power, these conservative forces are still very much present. Simply look at the fact that the authorities in Rome still want to determine how people should deal with their sexuality. The Roman Catholic Church still decides, be it from the background, how over a billion people think about life and death. The pope and bishops still raise their moralizing finger when confronted with active or passive euthanasia.

I have vivid memories of a newspaper article in 2002, in which a Dutch bishop made a statement about active euthanasia. He literally said, “When somebody chooses this form, he cannot receive the sacrament of the ill and he can also not be buried with official Catholic rituals. This is only possible when the priest in office is not informed.” In other words, let us pretend we did not notice! This hypocritical uttering is a typical example of Catholic obscurity and manipulation. This Church itself committed torture, rape and murder. Popes were guilty of promoting genocide and discrimination against large groups of native people around the world; but kept silent about their own polygamy and other rancid excesses. This Church should keep quiet, admit its sins, and give up all forms of authority. Even during the last few centuries, those who resisted were ruined completely. Priests personally took care of this. My mother told me that during her youth everybody followed Church orders without independent thinking. Whether you were a manager, teacher, laborer or mayor, it made no difference; it was common practice. When somebody protested, punishment by shame and ostracism immediately followed and in such a way, that the sinner could serve as an example to others. In these cases, it was very clear to people, the Church did not tolerate this kind of behavior and when you did it anyway, it only led to your own demise. That was a bleak prospect and therefore people held themselves strict to the rules. In the 20th century, the church was critical of regimes that hid and denied their criminal behavior, while at the same time making deals with men like Hitler and Mussolini. The Church itself had sown the seeds and now they forgot to organize their own affairs. The Church has always abused human emotions and spread fear, thus taking away people’s free choice. Children were infected in their early stage of development and, in a subtle way, emotionally driven in one direction. I only have to recall my own youth, and how I was indoctrinated by people who said things like, “I bet you will become a priest as well, right?

Seeing how the Church, in this case a bishop, apologized on a television show, is food for thought. The apology was spoken deliberately, in a cold and businesslike manner, without any form of compassion or empathy for the victims. No emotion was expressed, which is astonishing considering that tens of thousands of people have fallen victim to abuse and rape within the Church. The crusades took place between 1095 and 1271. They were military endeclared purpose of these crusades was to liberate the Holy Land from the Muslims, but they degenerated into huge massacres and depredations that were unequalled. Time and again, the crusades left a trail of blood and destruction in Europe and the Middle East. Wherever the crusades arrived, people were forced to convert to the one true religion. Those that refused were slaughtered by “Holy Warriors” commissioned by the pope in Rome. The participants were mostly noblemen and knights, who joined up with their own interests at heart. For instance, with the purpose of acquiring land or money in exchange. Many had lost their land because of redistribution, as a consequence of the feudal system. There was the added benefit of automatic forgiveness for all their sins. Traders also went along, because they were interested in developing trade between the Middle East and Western Europe. There was great poverty and discontent in Europe, causing enormous social problems. The people were desperate and furious because of the absurd wealth of the pope and the Holy Church. Because the churchly authorities were afraid there would be derailment and aggression, peasants, vandals, mercenaries who plagued the land with looting, rape and murderer were also allowed to join in. They were given a free hand to rob, kill and plunder somewhere else; and so, there was no shortage of volunteers. This way they could relieve their own poverty and give full vent to their aggression; moreover it solved a big problem for the popes and kings. During the Council of Clermont (November 26, 1095) Pope Urban II incited the first crusade. Byzantine Emperor Alexius I had asked for military assistance against the Seljuk Turks.

Here was a chance for adventure, wealth, and forgiveness for all your sins, even the sins you commit while on crusade. Men reacted to this unleashing of greed and religious fanaticism with great enthusiasm! Altogether, there were nine crusades. The last one ended in 1272. The horrible massacres that took place during these so-called Holy Wars, would now be judged as crimes against humanity. Later on, Romanticism embraced and glorified this churchly military endeavor. In this way, the crime and genocide instigated by the Roman Catholic Church was downplayed and pushed into the background. The Order of the Knights Templar consisted of knights who had joined laid down the monk’s vow for the Archbishop of Jerusalem and swore to protect the holy sites. They were accommodated in a wing of the palace of King Baudouin II, that bordered the former Al-Aqsa Mosque. Before long, they had the whole Temple Mountain at their disposal. On this hill, King Solomon had built his temple, around 1000 BC. But thereof was nothing more to be found, after it was destroyed in 70 CE by the Roman empire. A part of the treasure of Jerusalem had been hidden before the invasion by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in 586 BC; another part was hidden in the 1st century, during the Jewish Rebellion against the Roman occupation. Almost immediately after their profession, the group started to call itself the “Order of the Temple.” Their patron was Bernard of Clairvaux, Church Pastor and founder of the Cistercian Order. He appointed Hugh de Payens as Grand Master of the Knights Templar. During the famous Council of Troyes in 1129, Bernard recorded the rules and regulations of the order. He set the requirement that they live in complete obedience to the teachings of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and that they would protect those of the Desposyni who were still alive. The Temple Order was independent of the Church and monarchy. It fell under the personal authority of the Pope of Rome. The Knights Templar could ordain their own priests and were exempted from churchly taxes. The regular clergy had a hard time accepting the Knights’ privileged position, even though other monastic orders knew similar privileges. The Temple Order fought in the Holy Wars against Islam, protected the pilgrims and safeguarded the routes along which they travelled to the Holy Land.

They were allowed to kill Muslims, but any who killed a Christian were evicted from the order. The Knights Templar were infamous for their religious fanaticism and military character. They were fierce fighters against the enemies of their faith. On the other hand, they were also a traditional monastic order. They had to renounce worldly matters, in order to serve God and save their souls. They knew the common monk’s vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In their daily lives, the monks were required to pray, to do penance and to share with the poor. They had their meals in communal halls, in complete silence, listening to someone reading from the Bible. The crown of their heads was shaved and they grew beards. The knights wore a white shirt and the common soldiers a brown or black shirt. On the front was embroidered the famous Templar’s Red Cross, the symbol of Christ’s suffering. During the chapter meetings, all who were present had to confess their sins. The members were absolutely forbidden to own money or goods. Gambling and excessive drinking were prohibited, and the company of women was not allowed. The order became very rich, very fast. They owned many large estates in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in Europe. When noblemen joined the order, they abided by the vow of poverty and donated all of their worldly possessions to the order. On top of that, the order was exempted from paying taxes. Because of this, but also because, according to popular belief, they were in possession of the treasures of Solomon that they had retrieved, the Knights Templar became the most successful financial organization in history. They served as financial advisors and bankers of monarchies in all of Europe. The Temple Order grew to be the most powerful and prestigious brotherhood of the Middle Ages. During the building of the basilica of La Sainte Baume (The Holy Balm) in France, a church devoted to Mary Magdalene, Pope Boniface VIII entrusted the relics of Mary Magdalene to the Knights Templar. He did this because of their high status and capacity to safeguard things. King Philip IV (“the Fair”) was jealous and furious about this, more so because he owed the Temple Order a fortune in loans. He also feared their political and esoteric power, which far exceeded his own.

He was convinced they had brought the treasures of Solomon, as well as the Ark of the Covenant, from Jerusalem to France. He started a hate campaign against the Knights Templar and Pope Boniface. The test for young knights consisted of preparing them for possible capture by the Muslims. During this test they had to worship an idol in the form of a cat, called Baphomet. This Knights Templar “jest” was seen as heresy by their enemies. Anyway, Baphomet is a code that was used quite often by the Knights Templar, and it could be translated as Sophia, signifying the goddess of wisdom, Mary Magdalene. The Knights Templar felt very strongly about wisdom, so this “jest” must have had a deeper meaning. The one-atomic gold powder was called the “philosopher’s stone” by chemical analysts like Nicolas Flamel and it was used in the fabrication of the dazzling stained glass windows which were designed by Persian philosophers of the school of Omar Khayyám. Nicolas claimed that in order to make glass following their special procedure, they made use of the Spiritus Mundi, the cosmic breath of the universe. The Knights Templar called this part of their activities “Ormus.” A few decades ago, this science was rediscovered and the specific gold powder was called “Ormes.” The Knights Templar found the alluvial gold they needed for the production of the exotic Ormus material in Bézu (Languedoc, south-eastern France). Surrounding Bézu were old mines, rich in gold close to the surface. Bertrand de Blanchefort was the owner of this country estate. Later on, he became a Grand Master of the Knights Templar. From 1296, the activities were concentrated in one main building; the workshop in the nearby Campagne-sur-Aude. Knights were imported from Aragon in order to constantly watch the building from observation posts. The area was under the authority of the Spanish King of Aragon. King Philip suspected that the treasures, as well as the Ark of the Covenant and the relics of Mary Magdalene, were kept there. However, since the Knights Templar were autonomous within their own region and only had to bow down to the pope, he could not attack Bézu directly. That is why he wanted a pope whom he could manipulate, to grant him the necessary freedom. King Philip had Boniface VIII killed, and his successor, Benedict XI, was poisoned by Philip’s chancellor, Guillaume de Nogaret.

Philip had complete control over the new pope and, in this way, he could isolate the brotherhood in Bézu, so they could get no one’s support anymore. Then, his accomplices struck on Friday October 13th, 1307. The larger part of the treasure was hidden in the vaults of their Chapter Hall in Paris – the background for the famous painting of 1147 of the Knights Templar with the Ark of the Covenant. It is now exhibited in the Château de Versailles. He had the treasure of Paris transported by a fleet of galleys, from La Rochelle to Scotland and Portugal. One claim was that the Knights owned a human skull which they revered in a ceremony. Guillaume de Nogaret had the Knights Templar questioned with the use of torture, but nevertheless, Philip did not find out where the skull of Mary Magdalene was kept. On March 18, 1314, the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, died on a pyre in Paris. He had always kept silent during his trial. The accusations of heresy, homosexuality and adoration of Baphomet were unprecedented in those days. While on the pyre, De Molay cursed the king as well as the pope. Both died within a year. In 2001 Professor Barbara Frale found by accident the “Chinon Parchment” in the Vatican Secret Archives. This document dates from 1308-1314 but was found in the archive dedicated to the 17th century. It gives a description of the interrogations of 79 Knights Templar, held in the castle of Chinon. It also contains notes made by Pope Clemens V, directed at Bishop Jacques Fournier, who later became Pope Benedict XII. They show that in 1314, Clemens acquitted the Knights Templar of heresy, lent them papal absolution and even asked for their forgiveness. He had disbanded the Temple Order only under political pressure by King Philip IV. On October 25, 2007, the Vatican published the book Processus contra Templarios and declared the Knights Templar no longer to be heretics. This publication was based on the “Chinon Parchment.” Many of these Merovingians went into hiding and by reunification in the Languedoc they were able to hold on. They called themselves the Albigensians and turned this area into the most prosperous region of Western Europe. Later, they were referred to as Cathars, because the pope accused them of heresy.

They abided by the Gnostic teaching of Jesus and not by the Church dogma. In those days, the city of Albi was an important center. In the old language of Provence, the word albi also referred to a female fairy. Originally, this word came from the Old Testament and was a title for the head of a Royal family (elef). The name albi was a tribute to the royal heritage of the Davidian dynasty. The word Cathar literally means “the pure one.” They were very spiritual people and believed that an individual is a pure spirit that transcends the physical. Contrary to the greedy practices of Rome, they were open and transparent in their convictions. But the fear of the Pope for the Cathars was caused by something much more threatening. They were the guardians of a great treasure, that had to do with an esoteric wisdom, called Sapientia, which eclipsed Roman Christianity. Jesus had left this wisdom in the care of Mary Magdalene and their offspring. They were of course the royal heirs of Jesus and posed a great threat to the Pope of Rome. They were living proof that the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church was a tissue of half-truths, fantasies and outright lies. Contrary to the bigotry of the Roman Church and popular hatred, the Cathars took a tolerant stance towards the Jewish and Muslim cultures. Moreover, they maintained equality of the sexes. These were the reasons they were condemned by the Catholic Inquisition. They were also accused of blasphemy and perversion. These false accusations were contradicted by witnesses who later testified to the harmonious way the Cathars lived together, to their charity and their unbending devotion to the teachings of Jesus. They believed in God and had an exemplary society with good social care, like schools for the poor and hospitals. They lived in peace with others of different faith. They let everybody share in their prosperity and never imposed their convictions or views on anyone. They were non-conformist, preaching without permit, and had no need for specially appointed priests or richly adorned churches. Bernard of Clairvaux, a church teacher as well as a dreaded opponent of the pope, openly declared that no preaching was as Christian as theirs, and that their moral principles were pure.

The Albigensian society was tolerant and cosmopolitan, contrary to the rest of Western Europe. It was the center of poetry, troubadours and the courtly love culture. They taught classical languages, literature, philosophy and mathematics. The area was prosperous and economically stable, but that came to a truly apocalyptic end beginning in 1209. In 1208, the Cathars were handed a severe warning by Pope Innocent III for their supposed unchristian behavior. The Pope and the King of France joined forces because both had an interest in eliminating the Cathars. They were looking for an opportunity to influence public opinion in their interest and they were successful. One of the Pope’s representatives in the Languedoc, Pierre de Castelnau, was killed by anti-Church rebels. Rome did not hesitate to seize the opportunity to blame the Cathars. In 1209, a papal army of 30, 000 men , headed by Simon de Montfort, departed to the Cathar region. The fighters were disguised as Knights of the Cross and had a holy mission: to eliminate the Albigensian community. It is therefore called the “Albigensian Crusade.” The massacres lasted, all together, for 35 years and many tens of thousands of Cathars were killed. There was one day in which 20,000 people were burned alive, when the town of Béziers was laid in ashes. According to the Pope, it was no problem that orthodox Catholic citizens were also within the town walls during the burning, because “in the afterlife the Lord would recognize His own people.” Standing before the gates of heaven, the Catholics would be separated from the heretics! (Kill ‘em all and let God sort ‘em out). On March 16, 1244, the holy mission reached its climax in a horrendous massacre. The great and historic Montségur, the last fortress of the Cathars that remained standing, fell after a siege of ten months. The Cathars, to the end, bravely refused to repent – and this is why more than two hundred hostages were burned alive on the final pyre. Seen from a historical perspective, this massacre by the Roman Church is completely incomprehensible, because the Cathars formed no threat. The fact that they were linked to a very special old science was not new. After all, Guilhèm of Toulouse had founded his Jewish Academy 400 years before. But Innocent III and his bishops feared that the Desposyni among them would expose and overthrow the church dogma, as this was not based on any real foundation.

But Innocent III and his bishops feared that the Desposyni among them would expose and overthrow the church dogma, as this was not based on any real foundation. That’s why this fanatical and criminal regime saw only one solution: the order to “kill all Cathars and their supporters.” This sentence also applied to those who sympathized with the Cathars, and they were many. With this tyrannical and bloodthirsty action, Pope Innocent III gave a strong impetus to the recently organized Inquisition. It is important to note that most who were labeled as heretics were striving to regain the true Christianity of the time of the apostles and the early Church. This is an understandable desire, seen from a viewpoint of confrontation with the Roman Church, which by her riches and her greed for worldly power had little to do with what the New Testament said about what it means to be a Christian. In 1211, Simon de Montfort called together the “parliament” in Pamiers. He was the worldly leader of the crusade against the Cathars. A problem had arisen because the papal legate, the Cistercian Arnaud Amaury, was supposed to have said: “Although I wish for the death of the enemies of Christ, as a monk and priest, I cannot kill them.” A solution was sought and found: the Churchly Inquisition would point out the heretics and dictate an appropriate punishment, which worldly powers would execute. A churlish way to pretend their hands were clean of blood. There were a number of other rules laid down, the most influential being the one that said monks and priests, who were assigned to implement the Inquisition on behalf of the Church, were placed in a position above that of the worldly power. Therefore, they too did not have to account for their actions. From this point on, the Inquisition, under direct supervision of the Pope, became an inviolable, criminally-empowered tyranny over people who had no way of defending themselves. A power, not only of the Church in relation to the people, but also within the Church itself. This can be concluded from the following. To the monks, the ideal of poverty, as practiced by the sanctified Francis of Assisi, was the only road to God. But the Spirituals (followers of Francis) were condemned in great numbers as heretics and punished accordingly. Poverty, indeed! Fine for peasants and minor priests, but the Church Fathers had bigger (and tastier) fish to fry. The way the Church proceeded was often very subtle.

A delegation of inquisitors would arrive in a village and the priest would be asked to assemble the whole community in the church. Everybody would come, because it would be very suspicious not to attend. Then the inquisitors would speak to those present and exhort them to repent their sins. The severe cases were marked down on a list and a long waiting period was given between summons and presentation. The idea behind this was to give the suspect ample time to think about the questions they would ask him. Even during questioning, the suspected recusant was kept in the dark as to what he was accused with, meaning that he had no idea what he was up against. After a long interrogation that left the suspect terrified and totally confused, he was charged with some form of heretical behavior. Often it was then too late, and the defendant would be confronted with his own earlier statements. It was impossible for the accused to confront the prosecutor. The charge could be given anonymously and if there was no charge it could simply be made up.Prosecutor and judge were often one and the same person; the judge could investigate and formulate the charge himself. The suspect could be detained indefinitely until the prosecution was ready to proceed.The accused did not have the right to be informed of the charge until he or she was already, for all intents and purposes, condemned.Torture was allowed (practically compulsory) during interrogation and, from 1570, the safeguards that were initially incorporated in the system were abolished.The suspect was not allowed an attorney.The suspect could not call on witnesses. The coercion during these trials was not meekly applied. Confessions were enforced by means of threats and torture. People were tied and racked, burned with red hot pokers, hung in agonizing positions – whatever the interrogator’s fertile imagination could conceive. After the victim had confessed to whatever insane fantasy they had cooked up, if he repented he was decapitated or hanged; if not, he was sentenced to burn on the pyre at an always-popular Auto-da-Fé. But, whether he died during the interrogation or after the conviction was of no concern to the inquisitors, because the result was the same for them: The Church had been liberated from another heretic.

After 1400, when the French and Italian Inquisition had lost their strength, the violence raged again in Spain. The Spanish Inquisition was largely focused on Jews and Muslims, but gradually spread out over all of Europe. The character was the same and it was just as harsh. The screaming and the flames lasted until 1834. After 1520, absolutist sovereigns tried to centralize the legislation in a way that suited their purposes. The traditional jurisdiction, in which a person was accused and defended, was replaced by the Inquisition. This dominant form of jurisdiction was, under the influence of the Church, initiated in most of Europe, with England the only exception. n times when superstition was prominent, the churchly authorities I feared the intuitive side of women, because they could see through their intrigue and other falsehoods. Women engaged in all kinds of “heathen rituals,” such as traditional healing, and they posed a great threat to the male rulers’ hegemony. They were considered inferior, but because Dominic (the founder and religious leader of the Dominican Order of friars) was opposed to women, they became the focus of the inquisitors. After 1380, women were actively persecuted, because, according to the Inquisition, they had supernatural powers at their disposal. This is why they were called witches. The inquisitors abused their position of power on a grand scale and behaved like barbarians. Occasionally, an inquisitor would visit the accused women in the dungeons, seek one out and then take her away for interrogation. With a great show of power and under threat, she would then be sexually abused by this inquisitor. After that, he would have her tortured and killed, because this malicious woman had obviously tried to seduce him, a monk. In many ways, these battles were fought simply to keep women subdued and to control their imaginary powers of corruption. Churchly and governmental rules, like the introduction of mandatory marriage, were supposed to contribute, but, like any rule which directly opposes human nature, did not work out. This amendment of law coincided with the high degree of fear people had of sin, hell and the devil. As from 1450, women who did not live a life of chastity, and obedience to the authority of their husbands, were accused of being witches who had made a pact with the devil. They were accused of having voluntary sex with the devil on Witches’ Sabbath.

During the interrogations, under the most atrocious methods of torture, women were forced to name other participants in the Witches Sabbath; these women were arrested as well and went through the same ordeal. And so, from 1580 onwards, the infamous mass trials came into being, during which tens of thousands of women were killed. The Inquisition placed a severe strain on humanity. People criticized this “Mea Culpa,” because forgiveness was asked solely for acts committed by individual believers, not for the malignant policies implemented by several popes and other churchly authorities, which made this cultural genocide possible. Even during World War II, the Catholic Church did not have clean hands. Just remember the dubious role of Pope Pius XII, with regard to extradition of Jews, socialists, gypsies, homosexuals, et alia, to the Nazis’ new and improved version of Hell on earth. The Catholic Church did not oppose the mass murder of Jews and justified it by issuing the old favorite canard that they were guilty of the death of their Jesus Christ. It is absurd that this institution is still able to keep its balance and does not have to answer for all its crimes. In our Dutch democracy, ministers are called to account by parliament and even heads of state are liable when they are found guilty of genocide or overriding human rights. Especially because of this, it is unbelievable that Vatican City, a miniature state that does not amount to much, is still being shielded by fanatical Christian governments and exempted from all democratic responsibilities. It is easy to imagine why a virtuous man like the Patriarch of Venice, Pope John Paul I, wanted to end the impure practices that went on within Vatican City. Alas, his pontificate did not last very long, because he was eliminated by his opponents. But whether it concerns John Paul I, or anyone else, like the current Pope Francis, true honesty, justice, and atonement will not be tolerated within the closed circuit of the Church. I have no intention of making a list of all popes of the past. There have only been a few virtuous and intellectual popes. The overwhelming majority were power-hungry fanatics, mostly bent on enriching themselves and their families. Many popes lived licentious lives. Some were perverted, others were psychotic and paranoid by nature. From the beginning, there was a power struggle about the bishops’ choice of Rome, especially after Constantine had applied some structure.

The inhabitants of Rome had been given the right to choose their new bishop. The rich and noble families had interest to get their candidate elected, so they opposed one another and thereby no stone was left unturned. Bribery, threats and even murder were the order of the day. Within the Eastern Church, the bishops made use of the title “Pope” when referring to colleagues. Later on, this use of the term was adopted by Archdeacon Leo, who became Bishop of Rome in 440. He believed that he had the sole right to the title. After all, from the beginning, the Church had propagated the lie that Peter was tied to the episcopal throne of Rome. Illustrious Emperor, there are two sorts of power which rule the world: the holy authority of bishops and the authority of kings. The authority of bishops is superior to that of kings because bishops have to give account before the divine court for all people, even for kings. Your pious Majesty will decide henceforth, that nobody will ever, and under any human pretext, resist the unique function of the one that was placed above all others, following Christ’s orders, and is seen as the leader by the Holy Church. Human audacity can attack what is based on this firm divine right, but wherever the attack might come from, this legitimacy cannot be overruled. Felix IV, the son of a priest, became pope in 526. He fell ill soon after. He knew his days were numbered and appointed Archdeacon Boniface as his successor. The clergy did not agree with this and appointed Dioscorus as successor, shortly before the death of Felix. Boniface, of course, did not agree with this, and made sure the newly chosen pope would not survive. Three weeks later, Dioscorus died. Silverius was the son of Pope Hormisdas and was consecrated as pope in 536. Empress Theodora, in Constantinople, felt that this pope had to disappear and that one of her protégés, Vigilius, had to be the new pope. She hatched a plan and managed to bribe Antonina, wife of the Byzantine general Belisarius. In March of 537, Pope Silverius fell victim to Antonina and husband Belisarius, who locked the Pope in a small room. The clergy was informed that Silverius had admitted he was guilty of treason. On March 19th, Vigilius became the new pope. Emperor Justinian filed a lawsuit at the request of the Bishop of Lycia. This bishop was convinced of Silverius’ innocence.

But Vigilius devised a ruse by asking permission from the emperor to take the imprisoned pope under his protection. Silverius was handed over to his arch-rival, who banished him to the island of Sponza. There, Pope Silverius gave up his office “voluntarily” in favor of Vigilius, who promptly had his predecessor starved to death. Gregory was a brilliant lawyer and an important magistrate of Rome. He was the great- grandson of Pope Felix III and when his father died he inherited estates all over Italy. He sold them all and founded a Benedictine monastery on Sicily, to which he retreated. Pope Pelagius II appointed him as Deacon and arranged for him to be his representative at the imperial court in Byzantine. Emperor Maurice wanted him to be the successor. Gregory refused and tried to flee. Against his will, he was forced to accept the office of pope in 590. Despite everything, this pope enjoyed enormous popularity and went into history as Gregory the Great. After a few Greek and Syrian popes, the power struggle between Rome and Byzantium flared up again. Bishop Gregory was inaugurated as pope and Emperor Leo III made plans for his assassination. But the attempt was thwarted because the pope had supporters from several sides. Pope Gregory II focused on the German states and urged the English Benedictine Winifred (Bishop Boniface), to speed up the conversion of the Franks and the Germans. During the regime of his successor, Pope Hadrian I, King Charlemagne (Charles the Great) seized power in 774, by bringing to an end the two-hundred-year-old rule of the Longobards. He refused the pope any temporal authority or to cede territory to him. He had given himself the title “King of the Longobards” and in 781 he appointed his son Hadrian as King of Italy. The next pope, Leo III, approached King Charlemagne with exaggerated humility, which greatly annoyed the noblemen. Their dislike was such, that his eyes were put out during a procession in 799, whereby he was nearly killed. Charlemagne took him under his wing and had him brought to Rome under safe guidance. He restored the order and the culprits were punished. The blind Pope Leo had found out that the Imperial throne in Byzantium was unoccupied.

Under the pontificate of Sergius II (844-847), simony surfaced again. The trade in churchly titles and services brought in a lot of money. Sergius appointed, among others, his own brother, who was known to be corrupt, for the simple reason that he had sufficient wealth to pay the right price for his title. The Church immediately brought forward the “Decretals” of the famous Church Father, Isidore of Seville. These documents can be compared to the “Donation of Constantine,” except for the fact that this time, the forgers had been a lot smarter and practical. This fiat was supposed to demonstrate the supremacy of papal authority. The Decretals contained “evidence” that the spiritual power of the Pope of Rome was superior to worldly power and that this had been the case from the beginning of the primacy. Many popes demanded absolute power based on this decree, which was proven to be a forgery in the 14th century. Pope John VIII was more of a soldier than a priest. He was revengeful and violent. In December 882, he himself was killed by members of his own family in an atrocious way because he had denied them the privileges to which they thought they had a right. When the cup of poison was not effective quickly enough, they crushed his skull with a hammer. In May 896, Stephen VI became Pope. He was the son of a priest, and Pope Formosus (891- 896) had consecrated him as Bishop of Anagni. As a member of the Spoletians, he hated his predecessor for having the count of Spoleto removed from function. This psychopathic pope had the rotting corpse of Formosus dug up nine months after his death. He placed the corpse on a throne, vested it in papal robes and staged a macabre trial, the so-called “Cadaver Synod.” The pope cut the fingers off the right hand of the corpse, the one that had been used to bless the crowds. Then he had the remains cast into a grave that held the corpses of foreigners. But this vengeful man was still not satisfied. He had the body dug up again, had the limbs removed and finally thrown into the Tiber. In July 903, Leo V was ordained, but then imprisoned by September of that same year.

Christopher then took Leo’s place, but Sergius killed him with his own hands in January 904, after a fake trial, and was ordained Sergius III on January 29th. He had been the main instigator of the “Cadaver Synod.” In the beginning of the 10th century, the counts of Tusculum were able to impose their will on Rome. Godfather Theophylactus was a senator and the most prominent judge of the city. He was a powerful man, but his wife Theodora was even more powerful than he. They had two daughters, Theodora and Marozia, who very often frequented the Lateran Palace. Ten years before this, Theodora had taken notice of a public prosecutor for the Archbishop of Ravenna. Unable to resist, shortly after their first meeting he ended up in her bed – a great way to start a career in the Church! But Ravenna was too remote for the insatiable Theodora and that is why she made him Pope John X. After her mother’s death, Marozia took over her dominion. In May 928, she had the pope imprisoned and killed. Her current protégé and lover became Pope Leo VI, but after six months she had him bumped off too, to make way for her new lover, Stephen VII. He was then assassinated in February 931 and succeeded by her own son, Sergius ( John XI). Marozia had one ultimate dream: she wanted to become Queen or Empress. She was widowed now, and Hugo of Arles, the King of Italy, had also lost his wife. Because he was the brother of her second husband, however, a marriage between the two was legally impossible. Hugo devised a ruse and declared that both of his brothers were not of his bloodline. His brother Lambert did not accept this and therefore was murdered. The new pope consecrated his mother’s marriage, but the wedding turned out to be a dramatic event. Alberic junior, the son of her first husband, caused a scene and started to stir up the people against his new father-in-law. Hugo managed to escape and fled from Rome, but Marozia was chained and cast into a dungeon. The pope was not allowed to interfere. He was only permitted to offer quick prayers for his mother and was closely guarded. In this way, the female dominion in Rome that had lasted for thirty years came to an end.

A wealthy Roman businessman came home earlier than expected one day and found a stranger in his bed, next to his wife. The lover retreated under the bed-covers, but was beaten repeatedly with a poker. When no more sounds came from beneath the covers, the husband pulled them away and threw the battered body out the window. This was how His Holiness Pope John XII died, on May 14th, 964. In one of the his actions, Boniface VII, a man with a criminal temper, strangled his predecessor with his own hands. The Roman people revolted and he fled to Constantinople, taking with him the treasures of Saint Peter’s Basilica. Thirteen years later, when the emperor died, Boniface VII returned to Rome. With the support of Crescent junior, the current pope was killed, and he placed himself on the papal throne once more; but a year later, in that seemingly endless cycle, it was his turn. From the Papal Annals it appears that he ascended the throne three times: in December 1032, February 1045, and November 1047. The citizens of Rome had already enough of him in 1036 and wanted to take his life, which was one of horror and scandal. When the Archbishop of Milan denounced the papal morals, he was banished by Benedict IX. In 1044 the people revolted. The Pope was chased away and the tiara was sold to the highest bidder. Sylvester III became pope in January 1045, but in February Benedict returned and was officially re-elected in April. A problem arose when he wanted to marry the daughter of Gerard of Galeria, the captain of the insurgents who had expelled him. An ingenious and irreproachable priest, John Graziano, gave him the valuable advice to sell his Papal Office. By way of an official deed of sale, he sold his office for 1500 silver pounds, with the guarantee of a large annual allowance as well as the hand of Gerald’s daughter. John Graziano then became Pope Gregory VI. The abbot of Cluny and the holy hermit, Gunther of Niedertach, called on King Henri II of France to take responsibility and consecrate a pope who would bring honor to the office. A synod was held, where the fate of the squabbling popes was sealed: Benedict IX was expelled, Sylvester III was sent back to his diocese, and Gregory VI was banished to Cologne.

For centuries, the relations between the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople had been disturbed by theological differences of opinion that were hard to reconcile. Besides that, there were differences in language, tradition and cultural sensitivities. The new patriarch, Michael Cerularius, accused the Western Christians of heresy and wanted to have the Latin churches and monasteries shut down. Pope Leo IX strongly protested and sent a delegation to Constantinople. They received a very cold welcome there, with the result that the patriarch was excommunicated by the pope. The patriarch, in turn, then banished the pope. This caused a definitive break between the Western and Eastern Churches. The cardinalate was instituted, and the omnipotent Cardinal Hildebrand made sure that henceforth, the pope would be elected by and from the group of cardinals. The people, the lower clergy and the emperor himself were relegated to the role of giving their consent after the fact. The papal power had grown stronger. Pope Alexander II died on April 21, 1073, and Hildebrand hesitated not a moment to grab power and had himself “elected” by the people. He was ordained on the same day as the cardinals’ Pope Gregory VII. His collaborators called this pope “the Holy Satan.” He turned the papacy into a world dictatorship. He did not try to hide his feelings of vengeance towards the emperor’s son, because the last one had taken such a strong stance against simony under Gregory VI. This pope himself did not recoil from anything, not even letting the city of Rome burn to the ground. In a fanatic way, he wanted to give the power and glory back to the papacy that was dishonored and placed under guardianship. 2. Only the Bishop of Rome can call himself ecumenical. 3. Only he can consecrate or depose Bishops or grant mercy. 4. All Princes must kiss the Pope’s feet. 5. The Pope has the right to dethrone Emperors. 6. Nobody can invalidate his decisions; he alone can nullify sentences. 7. Nobody can judge him. 22.The Roman Church has never made mistakes and, according to the testimony of the Bible, also cannot make mistakes.

The Archbishop of Ravenna became the Anti-pope Clemens III. The king besieged the city of Rome, but Gregory refused to leave. However, in June 1083, Godfrey of Bouillon took the Papal Guard by surprise, after which Gregorius fled. In 1154, the first and only English pope was ordained as Hadrian IV. He was the son of a priest, who had fled to the monastery in order to escape his temporal fatherly duties. As a result, he had to go begging early in his life in order to survive. He embarked for France and did manual labor for the monks of Saint Raf. There he became a monk, then a prior and finally abbot. He wanted to reorganize the abbey and wrote a letter to the pope, who summoned him and ordained him as a cardinal. The clergy eliminated any form of municipal freedom and the people hated them for it. The Pope was no longer allowed to enter the Lateran Palace and had to settle with normal lodgment. When a cardinal was stabbed in the middle of a busy street, the Pope intervened. He enunciated the “Interdict” which was the first time a pope made use of this extreme means. Mass was no longer celebrated, bells were no longer tolled, there was no baptism, not even blessing, and there were no wedding ceremonies. At first, the Romans remained undisturbed, but no Holy Mass was celebrated at Easter. Four days after Easter, the senators went down on their knees and begged the pope to lift this unbearable sanction. Hadrian agreed, under the condition that they would hand over to him the leader of the progressionists who had led the revolt of the people. The people sacrificed their leader and the pope came back to his Lateran Palace. At the end of the 12th century, people were already becoming more aware and started to fight for freedom: democracy versus monarchy, Church versus empire, popular religion versus papacy. Italy became the birthplace of municipal freedom, republics were born, and Rome blossomed, economically as well as artistically. Outside the city, the pope could design the world according to his wishes, but inside Rome his power was no longer tolerated. For his coronation, Innocent III organized a prestigious procession, with pomp and circumstance which marched from Saint Peter’s to the Lateran Palace. The procession consisted of churchly sovereigns, lawyers, and judges. They were all on horseback, but only the pope rode a white horse.

The procession consisted of churchly sovereigns, lawyers, and judges. They were all on horseback, but only the pope rode a white horse. The procession was cheered by the people, while all of the church bells in Rome produced a deafening thunder. After Innocent III politics predominated, and actual religion moved more into the background. This brought nothing but disillusionment. All leaders were divided among themselves and the fifth crusade, instigated by the successor, Pope Honorius III, was a failure. There was now resistance among the Christians themselves, because they generally disapproved of the crusade against their fellow Christians, the Albigensians, that had been conducted with so much cruelty. On June 25, 1243, Innocent IV was chosen. He had absolutist ideas, was stubborn and unscrupulous. In 1244, the pope was warned of a fleet of ships nearing the coast, with 300 knights on board. They were coming to depose and imprison him. He dressed himself as a soldier, fled to Lyon and sought protection from the French king. Frederic II was dethroned, and his Kingdom of Sicily was taken over. Frederic pointed out the great danger of the popes to the world with these words: “I am neither the first nor the last that was dethroned by priestly abuse of power. If you obey these hypocrites, to whom all the water in the Jordan would not be enough to quench their thirst for power, you are an accomplice to their wrongdoings.” In 1277, Nicholas III was elected as the new pope. He was the son of a violent senator and distinguished himself by always letting his personal interests prevail. He was a real Roman, who measured “greatness” by the amount of acquired treasure. His family was immensely privileged, for his nepotism was without boundaries. Dante included this pope in Hell for his simony and nepotism. In the beginning of 1292, Rome experienced complete anarchy. There was pillaging, church possessions were stolen, and pilgrims were murdered. It was time to elect a new pope, but the cardinals could not come to an agreement. On August 24, 1294, Celestine V, totally unqualified for the task, was crowned as the new pope. He was a hermit, who had lived in complete seclusion for thirty years. Without any choice, he was forced to become pope – otherwise he would not have survived. Pope Celestine was weak, mentally unstable and not able to handle the power-hungry hordes of the Vatican.

Unfortunately, the incompetent was replaced by yet another Pontiff with an insatiable hunger for power and personal wealth. He made many enemies and, in 1297, was warned to withdraw himself. He reacted by banishing two cardinals, demolishing their birthplaces completely and confiscating all their goods. His successor, Innocent VI, tried to end the corruption and abuses. He asked the Roman Curia to live more soberly and limit its expenses. Apparently, though, nepotism missed the list on his reform agenda; he did not hesitate to favor his own family with rich rewards. His successor, Urban V, got permission to return to Rome, but when he arrived there in 1367 the city was in ruins and had been burned to the ground. His Vatican palace was so austere that, after three years of relatively Spartan conditions, he returned to the luxury of Avignon. A female beggar predicted that he would soon die if he left Rome and, indeed, he did a few months later. In 1378, the Neapolitan, Prignano, was elected as Pope Urban VI. Another arrogant despot, he treated his cardinals in an aggressive and presumptuous way. He scolded them and had no intention of letting them return to Avignon. The French cardinals hated him and finally fled. In cooperation with the current Anti-pope Gregory XI, who held residence in a fortified castle in Anagni, they drew up a manifesto that annulled the election of Urban VI. They elected Clemens VII, and he took his residence in Avignon. During the 52 years that followed there was a great schism. The battling popes in Rome and Avignon kept banishing one another, like children on a playground. “Am too!” Are Not!” Etc., etc. None of them was reliable and in the end, all of Western Christianity was excommunicated. Confusion reigned supreme over all reason. Urban VI was an extremely wasteful man, who mismanaged his affairs. He became unacceptable for his social environment, started drinking to extreme excess and went completely insane. He had cardinals tortured. Some were put in a bag that was sewn up and thrown into the sea, and others were buried alive. His successor Boniface IX made good use of Urban’s proclamation that 1390 was a Holy Year. He motivated people with the terrors of everlasting Hell in order to make them come to Rome for the Jubilee, where they could avoid damnation by buying an indulgence at the highest possible price.

This old reliable smoke-and-mirrors routine worked like a charm and the proceeds of the Jubilee enabled him to turn the Vatican into a stronghold of power. This is the origin of the expression: “Sometimes one has to pay a high price for something.” In 1409, during the Council of Pisa, both Pope Benedict XIII and Gregory XII were accused of schismatic behavior, perjury, heresy, and ordered to abdicate office, which they ignored. The council then elected the Anti-pope Alexander V and, hey presto, there were suddenly three popes! Alexander died only a few months later – probably by poisoning – and then there were two. On May 17, 1410, Balthasar Cossa was elected as Anti-pope John XXIII. He was known as a dangerous man, because he was an infamous murderer, who had already poisoned two popes. Although Balthasar was of noble descent, he led a lawless life enriching himself as a pirate in the Mediterranean. He became archbishop thanks to his influential family and discovered that the trade in indulgences and usury yielded even more loot than piracy, without the risks. He therefore bought his cardinalship and thus ascended to the papacy. He called a council in order to strengthen his position, but the result was disastrous. In 1414, the Council of Constance decided that Popes Gregory XII and Benedict XIII should abdicate. John XXIII was himself accused of simony and convicted for the scandalous life he had led prior to his election. John tried to flee, but he was imprisoned and deprived of his rights. It took months until Gregory was prepared to doff the tiara. Only Benedict kept resisting, because he wanted to die as a pope. He promised to withdraw to his fortified castle on the Peniscola peninsula. Until his death in 1423, he was the conductor of something resembling an operetta-version of the papacy. On November 11, 1417, the great Western Schism was finally over, when Martin V was elected as sole pope. Immediately, a new conflict was born – the battle between the council and a pope who no longer accepted that the council surpassed him. But the council had become aware of its power and wasn’t keen to give it up. The struggle between the council and the pope continued during the pontificate of his successor, Eugenius IV, and it was not until 1449 at the Council of Basel that Pope Nicholas V achieved victory; the Papacy was freed from all forms of examination and, in the following years, it appeared impossible to re-introduce", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:66:8d0ace6fca1d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 986, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "a pope who no longer accepted that the council surpassed him.

The characters of the men seated on the papal throne continued to fall short of spiritual purity. They abused their power when and wherever they pleased, and led bizarre lives. Between these two councils reigned popes who, by abuse of their power, caused irreparable tragedies. They were responsible for the first opening of the Great Schism that splintered Western Christianity. An era dawned of great inner and outer discord and disorder – an era in which nepotism became an institution. The popes lived in extreme luxury; their moral authority was a transparent mockery, and the worship of Mammon became their only true religion. To pay for this ever-mounting avarice, the trade in indulgences was intensified, while they were busy indulging themselves with women, orgies, intrigue, crime, sadism and dirty politics. Preceding the papal election, shameless vote-trading took place in titles, palaces, and incomes. The wealthy and noble courtesans used sex and influence to play the cardinals off against each other. They knew how to flatter them, seduce them and extract their secrets, which, in exchange for large sums of money, they swapped with other cardinals in between the sheets. There was blackmail, thievery and murder. The age-old stew of iniquity. This pope was also guilty of one of the great atrocities in history. He gave vent to his sadistic hatred of women by accusing them of having sex with the devil – they were witches. As a result, they underwent violent torture and were sometimes burned alive. There are not enough words to describe how the clergy treated women in those days. They were used and then murdered. After the death of Innocent VIII in July 1492, the Holy See of Saint Peter was auctioned in order to raise money. Rodrigo Borgia was the highest bidder. With his huge wealth, he managed to bribe five of the twenty-three other cardinals, which put him over the top. As Pope Alexander VI, he literally opened the Gates of Hell. He had three children by an unknown mother. He attracted women like a magnet, until Vannozza dei Cattanei managed to tie him down. He married her off to three subsequent husbands, who covered up for him and were rewarded with a position in the Roman Curia.

When Alexander VI became pope, Vannozza declared he was the father of her four surviving children. Giovanni de Medici received his first ordinations shortly before he was consecrated as pope. Under the name of Leo X, he was crowned on April 11, 1513. During this celebration, Rome was transformed to a grand exposition of heathen gods. This pope adored Mars, Venus and Pallas Athena. He loved the theatrical aspect of it all. His position as head of the Medici family seemed more important to him than his function as sovereign of the Church. Under his reign, aggressive nepotism reached new heights. He deposed dukes and offered their thrones to his family members. He had huge palaces built for his family and, to finance these, he ordered in 1514 the sale of indulgences for souls in purgatory, all over Europe. A Dominican named Tetzel was the star promoter of this trade. The maxim that resounded everywhere was: “When the florin reaches the bottom of the money box, the soul jumps straight from purgatory to heaven.” The sparring went on until, on December 10, 1520, Luther publicly burned the letter of excommunication he had received, and the wars of the Reformation were kindled. During the term of Pope Clemens VII (1523-1534), the schism soon resulted in Henry VIII’s declaration of independence for the English Church (albeit mainly for personal reasons). Pius took a fanatical stance toward any person who refused to accept Rome’s dogma. His battle against heretics was ruthless. His expression was: “No pity! No more reconciliations! Exterminate those who subject themselves as well as those who resist. Persecute them to the utmost, kill and burn them, set everything on fire and avenge the Lord.” In his theological holocaust prostitutes and adulterous women were also arrested and killed. Their father had held his family captive for years in a fortress in Rieti. He tortured his wife and abused his daughters. One day, the girls managed to kill their father and so put an end to the hell in which they lived, but the pope remained inflexible: the girls had murdered their father and therefore they deserved capital punishment. The people lynched the officially blameless executioner, because they could not vent their anger on the pope. During the pontificate of Innocent X, there was a female crypto-pope: Olimpia Maidalchini.

Overbearing and loud in nature, with an insatiable thirst for wealth, she was the widow of the pope’s brother and firmly took charge. Innocent had no authority and feared her. Olimpia instituted a provocative law in 1645: “During important ceremonies, whores were granted permission to be carried in a state-carriage. Because of the gifts she received from them, Donna Olimpia had decided to take them under her care and she even allowed them to adorn their carriage with her own insignia….” There was, as usual, much ostentation and scandalous intrigue. The lust for power, money and loose behavior seems to have been injected as a virus into the DNA of Europe’s ruling class, and there was never an end to it. From 1790, the Roman Church gradually lost more of its former monopoly on power. The bishops in Germany distanced themselves from the papal dominion. In revolutionary France, the state seized all churchly goods, took away the clergy’s established rights and dissolved all monastic orders. In 1792, 300 priests were executed and about 40,000 clergymen fled abroad. In February 1798, the French general Berthier conquered the city of Rome. He took away all worldly power from Pope Pius VI and proclaimed the Italian Republic. The pope was imprisoned, banished from Italy, and died in 1799. Napoleon needed 500 carriages to transport the treasures he seized to Paris. All cardinals fled to Venice, where they elected a new pope: Pius VII. Because the majority of the French people were Catholic, Napoleon needed the cooperation of the clergy and the pope to restore unity. He claimed the right to manage all churchly possessions. He sent soldiers to Rome and took five provinces out of the Papal State, which he then added to Italy. Napoleon made clear in a letter to Pius VII that he should be grateful to have no more worldly power. Therefore, he could dedicate himself much better to his true calling, the pastoral service. Pius replied by excommunicating all “villains” who had robbed the “inheritance of Peter.” This pope was also captured and taken to France. After Napoleon’s return from his ill-advised Russian campaign, his empire crumbled and Pius returned to Rome in 1814. Leo XII, who succeeded him, turned the clock back to the Middle Ages. He immediately eliminated the progressive Cardinal Consalvi, who advocated tolerance and freedom. The Inquisition and the witch-hunt were revived and proponents of a unified Italy were eliminated.

They were forced to listen to endless sermons, ostensibly to open their minds to the Roman Catholic truth, but really more a form of brainwashing, which had no effect except to instill fear of punishment. He prohibited inoculation against smallpox, because he felt this to be an invention of the devil. In 1870, the Churchly State disappeared, because Rome was overrun by the Piedmontese. The pope continuously excommunicated all sorts of people, but to no avail. He proclaimed himself to be a prisoner of the Vatican. The Catholics saw him as a martyr and conservative movements appeared in several countries which offered him support. The papal encyclical “Quanta Curia” of 1856, condemned all modern ideas. A yawning gap appeared between contemporaries and the Church became divided. This defeat was hard to accept, and their failing grasp on worldly power incited the Church to proclaim papal infallibility during the Vatican Council in 1869, in an attempt to gain back some status. It was an arrogant proclamation which bore witness to the fact that the pope did not like to lose face. At the council, 57 members planned to vote against the proclamation, but the vote was cancelled when the Franco-Prussian War broke out and many had to return to France and Germany. The greater part of the remaining opponents were Italians – they were poor and financially dependent upon the pope. The pope informed them that if they voted against infallibility, they would no longer receive basic necessities. Only two members present voted against the proclamation, and so this ridiculous dogma became official Church policy. Pope Pius XI was elected in 1922, the same year Mussolini’s “Black Shirts” undertook the march to Rome. A concordat was reached on February 11, 1929, in which the papacy acknowledged the Kingdom of Italy, with Rome as its capital. For renouncing its former State, the Church received 1,750,000,000 lire and an enclave of about 110 acres (Vatican City). As a result, the Church could officially engage in diplomatic relations with other states. His successor, Pius XII, became known as ascetic and “silent.” His silence with regard to the atrocities of the Second World War was certainly remarkable. With the knowledge of this craven puppet-pope, hundreds of thousands fell victim to a quick or slow death, for their nationality, politics, religion, or race.

In 1978, 65-year-old Venetian patriarch Albino Luciani was elected as Pope John Paul I. He was the kind of man one could compare to Gandhi or Martin Luther King. Contrary to many previous popes, who exercised their power over a significant part of the world population, John Paul I with his loving appearance, was not directly the epitome of such power. Alas, his life did not last long. Vultures and power-crazed elitists like Bishop (and Vatican Bank director) Paul Marcinkus, and Cardinal Jean Villot, did not want their monopoly broken by this upstart pope, whom they perversely saw as a bigot. So, this honest man had to be removed. They carried out a plot, devised by the Vatican medical service and Cardinal Villot. John Paul I died under very suspicious circumstances, and to this day no death certificate has been made public, despite repeated requests. After a cursory visual examination it took the Vatican physician only a few minutes to announce the cause of death as a heart attack. No other doctor could be found willing to take responsibility for this diagnosis; no autopsy was performed, and all subsequent requests were refused. Cardinal Villot had his reasons. Afterwards, the cause of death was completely contradicted by other experts. Of all texts I came across during my search for the truth, the books describing the old knowledge, Gnosticism, intrigued pel, comes to mind, as well as author Jacob Slavenburg. While I was reading their books, one surprise followed another. It was all so logical that I immediately felt, “Yes, this is how it works.” The pieces of the puzzle kept falling into place. Gradually, I discovered the elements which the early Catholic Church used to implement their distortions of the historical truth. I also discovered that the historical figure of Jesus was the greatest Gnostic of all times. He was a seer, a human being of high sensitivity, a light-worker, who carried all knowledge and wisdom within himself. He wanted to make the people conscious and learn that we are connected to the Father, the all-embracing Light, the All. We are all part of the All, because our spirit is part of this Light. The word gnosis means knowledge from within, knowledge from the heart and teaches us that all is one, that the Divine is present in everything and in every person.

Everybody is, so to speak, like a spark of the great whole. The best philosophical minds we know were in fact Gnostics, because they were aware of this. The Church was of no concern to the Gnostic, because he did not need a priest or a saint to act as intermediary between man and the Divine. He forms the All-embracing in himself! Gnosis is a universal knowledge and is not connected to any form of organized religion. It is something that has always been and always will be, because it is a part of human nature. Religion, however, has been artificially created by us, and it replaces the inner experience with the external form. The religious movement called Catholicism has regarded Gnosticism as hostile from the start, because it confronted them with their own falsehoods. Religion is impure, because it is connected to the human ego. Light and darkness are opposites, but at the same time they can go hand in hand – if they are connected by balance. Gnosticism is quite clear about that. If you wish to reach this stage, it is important to open up to your feelings. This means that you have to open up to your higher self. From this, automatically flows the recognition that there is a source of Life, which is also a source of guidance. Jesus of Sirach, an important philosopher, was the author of a Gnostic writing which was omitted from the Bible. I quote: “He gave them knowledge and they inherited the law of life.” He refers to the All. When we have been given knowledge (gnosis) and we have gained insight, we come to realize that we have to act from this richness deep within ourselves. These inspiring words of Jesus of Sirach have the power to awaken echoes in our deepest being. We can use the insight we have gained in order to penetrate deeper into our hearts. That is where one finds the Source and we can experience and love it. We start to realize that nothing in the world is more important. As a result, you peel off the ego still further and then let go of it, in order to get closer to the Source. In this way, we become aware of the fact that we are, ourselves, part of the Light and that is our heritage! This is how we receive the law of life. We get to know the meaning of all, which the Source expresses in a loving creation. It is an everlasting treaty which has been made with each living being.

To create means to form a bond with that which is created. All of us are probably familiar with the expression, having seen the light, but we speak these words without realizing them. It actually does not refer to having seen the light with our physical eyes. It means, to gain insight. It is like shutters have been opened and suddenly we can see the real essence of some life aspects. Consider A Christmas Carol, Dickens’ much-beloved story of Ebenezer Scrooge. After a life of misery and avarice, on Christmas Eve he takes a harrowing dream-journey through the denials and mistakes of his past, his present isolated unhappiness, and the dire consequences coming in the future. His eyes open to the truth, and on Christmas morning he wakes to a new and joyous consciousness. The light within him has been relit and good will has prevailed. The light that is being referred to here, is the basic principle of our existence. When you become conscious of this inner beacon, it will change the direction of your life. For the Gnostic, darkness equals the world of limited thinking, without enlightenment. It is a world filled with illusions, uncertainties, false promises, tiredness and compulsive behavior. It is characterized by pain and misery. In short, this is the world we are all familiar with. The Gnostic knows very well that this world is not his original home. We could say that the Gnostic wakes up by his insight, while others remain asleep. Because when we keep placing our trust in our intellect and see our surroundings as the only real existence, our lives will stay limited to the material aspect. Some time ago, the late Pieter de Boer (professor emeritus of philosophy in Leiden) remarked during an interview: “Wisdom and imagination are more important than knowledge and information.” An interesting statement, because it is true that the inner knowing is far more important. I think everyone, at a certain point in time, must let go of denial of the inner experience and duality, which arises from being. Because only then, can the inner light to which the Gnostic refers can be ignited. The fact that every human being is part of the Life Principle is anchored in gnosis.

From the point of view that this insight is the foundation of reality, light is shed over a large spectrum, which would remain closed if we kept seeing the material as the only purpose. In the eyes of the Gnostic, a birth is the incarnation of a soul that starts a new path of development. When we keep considering the outside world as reality, we will always be confronted with disappointment, pain and sorrow. We live in a world filled with structures and material truths, invented by people and blown up like castles in the air. It is great to have a good life and to enjoy it; there is nothing wrong with that, but the essence is about the way you deal with it! We can get attached to our material possessions, but we can also view them as no more than utensils. Sometimes, one wonders how it is possible that certain Christian factions have the nerve to use words like the “ones who are lost.” It is not only arrogant and shameful, but also humiliating. So, if a person does not belong to their religious faction, he is lost! But there are no such things as heaven, hell and purgatory. Nobody gets lost, because every soul is part of the Light and will eventually return there. The Western world is governed by the fear of death. After all, we do not know what will happen to us after we die, and since the Holy Church has employed indoctrination and threats on us for centuries, we never know if we have lived our life in a (sufficiently) good manner! This fear is so strong, that people even have trouble surrendering to death. Everybody knows our physical existence is finite, but at the same time people do not like to ponder this subject. Our existence is founded on great wisdom, which has been completely suppressed by our rational thinking. It is good to realize that we depend on a Source that controls our lives. Everybody can experience this, but it can be hard to accept when we think about it. Many people have trouble dealing with this and avoid it, even when they regularly experience that certain things develop along different and unexpected pathways from what they thought they wanted.

The Gnostic views his inner knowledge as a personal good, which he has earned by learning processes in previous lives. This inner knowledge lives on, recorded in the deeper layers of his consciousness. By allowing self-knowledge to play a part in daily life, the Gnostic acknowledges the Christ within himself. The result is an attitude to life that is more positive and balanced. This knowledge was dangerous to the Roman Catholic Church. By being untouchable and furthermore by weaving a spell of mystery which defied understanding by the average citizen, the Church turned its ideas into myths. This was easier, because the ideas were well protected and not negotiable. People kept hearing sayings like “you have to believe this, because it is the Word of God,” and this was the reason the human soul kept moving away from its eventual goal: enlightenment. But the Church had misjudged! Gnosticism was kept alive during all the centuries. Even theological and philosophical science could not ignore it. This was most obvious during the Renaissance. The term gnosis was avoided, because it was not accepted within Catholic Christian thinking in those days. It was therefore called Neo-Platonism, because Plato taught us that outside the sensory-perceptible cosmos, there is a world that is eternal and imperishable that could only be observed from a contemplative perspective. To Plato, everything was a gift from higher realms and he was very aware of the fact that we are connected to everything around us. Aside from that, people were, during this period, very interested in the thought of revelation – a philosophical body of ideas based on the idea of reincarnation. By using the Church as a means to find deliverance, we automatically identify ourselves with the specific interests of this organization and support its right to exist. This institution of the Church has always been the cause of ideological conflict, resulting in groups of people fighting each other. Fortunately, we are now in the privileged position of having freedom of religion and freedom of opinion. Therefore, we can rightfully question things like writings inspired by God, the Word of God, Papal Infallibility and dogma. In the last half-century, people’s interest in spirituality has grown enormously. We can conclude this from the many books published in this field and from the rise of esoteric centers and shops.

People are not only looking for answers, they also feel the need for profundity and conduct their own search for the essence of existence. Apart from that, people remain curious and want to find out what the future might bring. Current spirituality leads us back to personal experience. It allows people the space to find the Light by way of a personal quest, because this is what modern man needs – without interference of the Church and its authorities. Gnosis makes us discover that we are immortal and that the physical body is not the most essential thing in our existence. Because of our greed, we lost sight of this essential theme. Spirituality brings the unique characteristics of people to the surface and enables us to experience a transformation within our consciousness. Contrary to the made-up story about Eden, the earthly Paradise, in which the man came first, the woman was seen as the first in the old cultures. Also, for the Cathars, woman was the goddess of life. The soul incarnates through a woman and she reveals. The man is there to assist her. That is why Jesus gave his wife, Mary Magdalene, the place she deserved. The Gnostic writing Pistis Sophia, which resurfaced in the 18th century, tells us about Sophia, the female part of an androgynous emanation of Light, who took creative action. She formed a creature called Demiurge (half work). Because this creature originated outside the masculine part of the emanation, it was incomplete and not connected to the Light. Therefore, it disappeared into the chaos. Pain and sorrow are elements in our karmic life that help us grow. It is a good thing that we encounter all kinds of problems in our lives, because this enables us to learn and grow wiser. Problems are there to be solved and left behind. Many people have problems with letting go. Gnosticism teaches us that everyone is responsible for his own personal life. As long as people get stuck in their own problems, do not cut the knots, do not make decisions and can’t let go, everything remains as it is, and things continue to repeat themselves, until we finally wake up. Life means to be there in Love and Light, for our fellow beings, helping where we can and supporting people when they are lonely. Making contact, carrying a bag filled with joy and love.

They had a just and harmonious society, which grew to be the most prosperous community in Europe. We often say “so long” to somebody, because we want to be polite, or we say it out of habit, when often we do not have the intention of coming back. Nevertheless, it is special to say this to a dying person. The deeper meaning was explained as follows: the phrase “au revoir” expressed the longing to see the soul of the dying person again in another life. It would be better if all of us recognized that everything depends on love, peace and mutual solidarity. Our world would be a totally different place! It should start with the governments which represent the peoples, but in order to do this they should let go of their arrogance and their focus on the ego. It’s all about equality and fraternity. Governments should serve the people and not the other way around, as is mostly the case presently. Let’s stop eroding society by enlarging the gap between the rich and the poor. Gnosis confronts us with standards and values we are all familiar with, but which have fallen into the background. For Gnostics, it was of the utmost importance that all people are ethereally connected and evolve together, without necessarily being aware of it. According to their view, evolution happens outside the human field of perception and everything is so intricately interwoven that an encounter or even a smile have their effect on human karma. They felt that “greatness” was expressed in a person’s attitude to life, for instance by giving up an aspect of oneself in the interest of the other. Are you prepared to accept and respect others the way they are? Gnosticism teaches us that nobody is perfect, that everything belongs to everyone and that nobody can afford to place himself above someone else. Gnostics highlighted the fact that we are cosmically connected to one another, because we are all part of one big energy of life. According to the Cathars, this energy of life is all around us. Nowadays, we call it the aura. The Cathars had no trouble accepting death – they chose the pyre above a forced conversion to Catholicism. They realized that death is no more than letting go of the physical body, and that we live on in the great universe. They knew there are three cosmic dimensions: the spirit, the soul and the body.

These three dimensions together make up human existence. The body is our earthly vehicle. The soul or astral body is the vehicle in which we continue after death. The spirit is our entity, or who we truly are, and that is a part of the all-embracing primordial Principle of Life – the Light. Most remarkable is the energetic connection between mankind and the cosmos. By way of our energy body, we are connected to other cosmic fields, but science totally ignores this. The Gnostics called it Pleroma, the Fullness of the original Emptiness. It forms itself within our brain and from there it gets divided into receiving and sending. This is of the utmost importance, because it is the way to get in touch with other human beings. The ether is constantly filled with all kinds of information, which we can receive. Our spirit has unlimited power. After all, we are connected to the collective unconscious, as noted in the writings of Carl Gustav Jung. In my view, he was not a “thinker,” but got his inspiration from a deep wisdom we could call soul-knowledge. Jung and Einstein were not scientists who just worked from cognitive knowledge; they were more inspired from their inner knowledge. The same goes for plenty of others, but they may not be aware of this and would probably not be open to this view. Fortunately, there are also those that are aware of it. Mankind wishes to break through a certain paradox in order to capture the Nothing, but we cannot fathom the greatness of the cosmos. To compensate, theological science has created a divine being of the Primordial Principle and expressed in a human form, the Creator, which is worshipped by the Churches as their God. They do not worship the All, the Father, but the Demiurge. The chaos and gloom in this world, that were created by the Demiurge, has been simple-mindedly explained by the Church: Blame the Devil (which they invented). They used ruthless force, manufactured history and dreamed up clever rhetorical illusions that seemed to give a firm foundation for their great castles in the sky. By accepting the World of Light, we experience the birth of the insight that “the Nothing is the All.” For the World of Light is in fact, the situation in which we find ourselves after our death.

It is the situation to which we belong. Time, space and limitation are parts of the material world. These concepts have no existence in the World of Light, and the same goes for Good and Evil. Long ago, I was walking along the seashore and I realized I was the only one on the beach. Suddenly, I felt tiny and insignificant. At that moment I realized that man, compared to the cosmos, is less than a grain of sand. Silence welled up from inside and I knew I could approach the Nothing from this silence. I felt a deep respect inside myself come up. Then it became clear to me that life fluctuates. There is a time for rising, a time for descending, and it is important to keep the balance. When one component keeps tearing down the other, we have to rediscover that which was lost. Suddenly, I remembered a theory of Einstein’s, in which he states that an object which moves forward by the speed of light loses its mass and is transformed into energy. During this process time slows down, gravity loses its grip and the zero point is reached, after which, time and gravity disappear completely. There are people who, by way of their strength of mind, can transform themselves and reach the same point. This form of manifestation is also found with the historical person Jesus. Because of his development, he had control over the material as well as the immaterial side of life, but the people around him had problems understanding his conduct, because of their lower consciousness. Hence, people saw his actions as supernatural – fully in line with the invented image of God by the Roman Catholic Church. Many apocryphal texts state that if we want the light within us to remain radiant, we should not look for the dark, for then we will always fail. In this case, I think of one of Jesus’ statements in an apocryphal writing of his brother James: “Do not turn the Kingdom of Heaven into a desert inside yourselves. Do not be proud of the Light that enlightens you, but be proud of yourselves, as I am proud of you. I have placed myself under the flesh, in order for you to be saved.” This text strikes me as very special.

Be kind to yourself, as I am to you. I want to pass this on to you, so you can become aware of it. Gnosticism teaches us that all is in a constant flow of change (Panta rhei). It has to be so, because otherwise we would stagnate and not be able to grow. Gnosis shows us what we are doing and how we interact with others. We have to guide our children in this. This is very important, because in our society we encounter more and more children with high sensitivity. They have trouble dealing with injustice, unfairness and authoritarian behavior, which does not hold them in consideration. This is a great responsibility for the parents and for the educational system. Spiritual growth, as a process of increasing awareness, is very resilient and gives us a clear direction. It makes us stronger and lends us more self-confidence. We gain insight into how and why certain processes take place. This helps us in dealing with them. It helps us to see the relativity of problems, leads us to inner peace and a more intensely engaged way of living. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. People generally assume that the Grail is somehow connected to Jesus. And it is! According to some traditions, it was the cup from which Jesus and his disciples drank during the Last Supper. Or, it was the cup in which Joseph of Arimathea caught the blood of Jesus as he hung from the cross. Sometimes it was both. However, we must ask ourselves whether the Grail was a cup at all. Inquisition was in full operation and people had to be very careful about exercising their mouths. The Roman Catholic Church was a theological dictatorship, and, in most practical terms, the Church was the State.

To escape the censorship and terror exercised by the Church, people were very inventive and used several forms of art in spreading their messages. Painters made use of symbols and authors used coded language, to communicate their heresies in cryptic ways discernible by those who had occult knowledge. Percival, knight of the Grail, by Wolfram von Eschenbach is the most well-known book about the Grail. The author based his novel on information from someone he refers to as Kyot de Provence. There are no other references to this Kyot, but researchers managed to identify him. His true name appears to be Guiot de Provins, a troubadour from Provence. He was a monk and a spokesman for the Knights Templar. Von Eschenbach tells the following story: Percival is a prince who is unaware of the fact that his father, who has passed away, was a knight. As a young man he meets some knights by accident, who impress him mightily. This motivates him to search for King Arthur, the only one who can grant him knighthood. After a long journey with many adventures he finally reaches the Grail fortress of King Arthur, who then knights him. This novel is filled with symbolism we can recognize from the Gnostic teachings. Percival’s search for the Grail can be seen as an awakening, a growth process of the soul. In the self-interest of the Roman Catholic Church, the facts about the Priest Kings and the Grail family had to be suppressed. After the 7th century, they systematically destroyed thousands of documents, and therefore, there is little or no detailed history known about certain periods. During one period, common people were even expressly forbidden from learning to read and write; only the clergy were allowed to do this. But what is this Grail, shrouded in mystery through the ages, in fact? A few centuries after the Grail romances appeared, suddenly the word holy was connected to it. The term “Holy Grail” was used for the first time by the Englishman Sir Thomas Malory, who edited the French Saint Grail in the 15th century, in Le Morte d’Arthur. “Grail” was derived from the French word Sangraal. We just used the word Saint Grail, but it was a slip of the tongue or a misspelling, which was quite normal for that time. “Sangraal” is derived from Sang Real – “Sang” means blood and “Real”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242363_cleaned.txt:81:4e7631d02547", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1001, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242363_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242363", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242363_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "holy was connected to it.

It is like a word game. This is how coded language was used: concepts were hidden in a way that was only understandable to insiders. The question arises, “How is this related to France?” After the crucifixion, the pregnant Mary Magdalene fled from Palestine with some family members. They traveled, by boat, to the south of France, where they were safe within the large Jewish population.The “holy royal blood” originated from Mary Magdalene – a bowl or cup became the symbol of her womb.

Thus, in the end, it wasn’t entirely clear what the point of it all had been. Thankfully, “Project Blackjack” was harmless fiction and subsequently relegated to the dustbin of conspiracy-theory history – although, periodically,s someone with nothing better to do dredges it up and attempts to breathe new life into it by pinning the plot to an upcoming date, with the predictable result being that these occasions, too, invariably come and go without consequence. here’s terrorism, which has essentially been with us in one form or another 1 since the Dawn of Man, and false-flag terrorism, which emerged nearly simultaneously with the first forms of government: Destroy something, blame it on those you dislike and unleash holy hell on them. More recently, the specter of nuclear terrorism has emerged, and, with it, the prospect of nuclear false flag terrorism. he horrendous reality of nuclear war has plagued the earth since Hiroshima T and Nagasaki, and has been the subject of countless works of fiction and nonfiction, television programs and motion pictures. The possibility of state- or “shadow-government”-sponsored terrorism involving nuclear weapons is a fear that has manifested more recently and been dealt with in the media and popular culture to a lesser extent. I wrote a fictitious scenario involving the latter in “Black Christmas: A Work of Predictive Fiction” (contained in The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual, published in 2012), which dealt with a Yuletide nuclear terror attack on Phoenix, Arizona, orchestrated by the global elite but, as on 9/11, carried out by and blamed on Muslim patsies.

The entire affair started off rather modestly with a small bunch of fruitcakes proclaiming that the end of the world was nigh, and by the time it was over everybody and their dog had jumped on the Bandwagon of Doom, including (not surprisingly) Hollywood and (only slightly surprisingly) the History Channel. A plethora of books, websites and documentaries – and a major motion picture – asserted that this was it, the Big One … for real. December 21^(st) , 2012 was purported to be the end of the Mayan calendar and, according to ancient Mayan prophecy, the End of the World. But it was neither, and in fact the Mayans never said it would be. Their calendar did not end, and, obviously, neither did the world. In fact, as it turned out, that particular date was probably one of the slowest news days in modern history. (I don’t think there was even a murder in Chicago that day.) On this day, U.S. Senator and Skull & Bones member John Kerry was nominated by President Obama as the next Secretary of State, and the funeral service for long-time Democratic U.S. Senator from Hawaii Daniel Inouye was held at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. For a variety of reasons I’ve speculated about elsewhere 2^(nd) book, Chapter 50), I suspect that Inouye’s timely passing and winter-solstice funeral constituted some sort of ritual-sacrifice-of-the-tribal-elder thing, but Γm not going to rehash that here. Earlier in December 2012, a social media vira-marketing campaign was launched claiming that, according to one of Nostradamus’ prophecies, Psy was in fact one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and that once his “Gangnam Style” YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would come to an end. The campaign was a success, the goal was reached and everyone lived happily ever after. Everyone, that is, except for reality television star couple Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, who, it was later revealed, had somewhat hastily spent most of their $10 million in accumulated earnings by 2010 because they actually believed the fictitious “Mayan Apocalypse prophecy” that the world would end in 2012.

The Mayans, however, never said that this event would herald the destruction of the planet. No asteroids. No solar kill strike. No geomagnetic pole reversal. No alien invasion. The idea of the year 2012 as the End of All Things slowly gained momentum in the years preceding, and by the time the thing gained a full head of steam, it had turned into the biggest steaming pile of unsubstantiated pseudoscientific horse manure the world has ever seen. Hordes of the undiscerning jumped on board, zealously peddling boatloads of nonsensical conjecture regarding global cataclysmic effects that would result from this, that and the other, and proselytizing anybody who would listen. It seemed for a time that practically everybody outside the mainstream scientific community had bought into the modern myth to some degree or another, and a genuine Apocalyptic fervor gripped large swaths of the planet. During the very finite window of time leading up to 2012, proponents and practitioners of almost every ethnic group and religion on earth breathlessly purported that, indeed, their prophecies, scriptures, elders and priests, too, spoke of this time in human history as being The End. Don’t tell us it’s the bleeping end of the world, we knew it all along. Galactic Alignment is a purely visual phenomenon occurring from the perspective of the surface of the earth. Due to the wobble in the earth’s axis and the resulting “precession of the equinoxes,” every 26,000 years or so the sun, from our vantage point, lines up with the galactic equator near galactic center – more precisely in a region known as “the dark rift.” In reality, this visual alignment didn’t occur only on December 21^(st) , 2012, but has taken place over a roughly 40-year period, beginning around 1976.

Big whoop. You mean to tell me all the fuss over 2012 was basically because some old South American shamans in antiquity stayed up way too late way too often drinking way too much DMT-laden ayahuasca and centuries later a handful of half-educated Western dipnuts mis-interpreted their glyphs as prophesying the End of Time…and half the population of the planet bought in? he U.S. Capitol building. The Washington Monument. The Lincoln T Memorial. The White House. The incredible architecture and monuments of our nation’s capital became everyday sights for me when I worked in Washington, DC, from 1995-2001. They never fail to impress when you look at them, but those who live and work there notice them less and less over time. N ot long after I arrived in DC, leader of the Nation of Islam Louis Farrakhanorganized “The Million Man March,” and in his address to the attendees in the capital that day, he made multiple references to symbols he claimed were incorporated in the layout of Washington, DC, and to related numerology. The whole event was somewhat of a spectacle, but the occult references in particular amused a number of the journalists at the then-newly-launched neoconservative Weekly Standard magazine where I served as art director. There, in the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555 feet high. But if we put a 1 in front of that 555 feet, we get 1555, the year that our first fathers landed on the shores of Jamestown, Virginia as slaves. In the background is the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial, each one of these monuments is 19 feet high. Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president. Thomas Jefferson, the third president, and 16 and 3 make 19 again. What is so deep about this number 19? Why are we standing on the Capitol steps today? That number 19! When you have a nine, you have a womb that is pregnant.

This is all placed and based in a secret Masonic ritual. And at the core of the secret of that ritual is the Black man. Not far from here is the White House. And the first president of this land, George Washington, who was a grand master of the Masonic order, laid the foundation, the cornerstone of this capitol building where we stand. George was a slave owner. George was a slave owner. Now, the President spoke today and he wanted to heal the great divide. But I respectfully suggest to the President, you did not dig deep enough at the malady that divides Black and White in order to affect a solution to the problem. And so, today, we have to deal with the root so that perhaps a healing can take place. Now, this obelisk at the Washington Monument is Egyptian, and this whole layout is reminiscent of our great historic past, Egypt. And, if you look at the original Seal of the United States, published by the Department of State in 1909. Gaylord Hunt wrote that late in the afternoon of July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress resolved that Dr. Benjamin Franklin, Mr. John Adams, and Mr. Thomas Jefferson be a committee to prepare a device for a Seal of the United States of America. … For the back of the Seal, the committee suggested a picture of Pharaoh sitting in an open chariot with a crown on his head and a sword in his hand, passing through the divided waters of the Red Sea, in pursuit of the Israelites. And, hovering over the sea was to be shown a pillar of fire in a cloud, expressive of the divine presence and command. Ultimately, whatever “secret that has to be unfolded” Farrakhan was referring to remained hidden as nobody could figure out what in the hell he was talking about. Most members of the mainstream media simply ignored his occult references or considered them as essentially the ramblings of a race-baiting demagogue. t the time, I paid no attention to Farrakhan’s cryptic references, nor was I in the least interested in conspiracy theories or alternative history.

I suppose then that it is somewhat ironic that, over a decade later in 2012, the first of two books on conspiracy theories I authored was published. The first, as mentioned previously, is entitled The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual, and the second, Most Dangerous: A True Story, published in 2015, in part concern a series of unfortunate events that befell me and my family as a direct result of my authoring the first book. The story of my transition from the mainstream media world to the bizarre conspiracy-theory alternate universe is not as interesting, or as tragic, as that of my transition from working in one of the most influential political magazines in the most powerful city in the world to becoming unemployed and living in a mobile home in my in-laws backyard in rural northeast Mississippi – but both of those subjects are a story for another time (if ever). lthough the 2012 Doomsday was a huge non-happening, Galactic Alignment was, in a sense, very real. It did not involve forces of nature or the supernatural run amok, and presented no physical danger to humanity. It did, however, involve the alignment of heavenly bodies and other features in the night sky ( if only from our vantage point), which is to say the stuff that astrology is made of. If there ever was a genuine metaphysical science that the modern superstition of astrology might have descended from, as some current followers of the ancient Vedic tradition contend, that particular brand of wisdom is lost to the sands of time, because what we’re left with today is pure hocus pocus. Nonetheless, astrology remains an integral aspect of the contemporary occult mindset. o, although Galactic Alignment itself presented no existential threat to $\\textgreater$ humanity, there are those very powerful practitioners of the occult for whom this celestial phenomenon would have been quite significant – a once-in-a-26,000-year occasion.

And among those practitioners are the super-elite psychopaths who rule the planet and control all its resources and peoples. For those who have not read my first book, such was the case with the attacks of September 11^(th) , 2001: this date was selected with intentionality and great purpose, and is of great importance to worshipers of the Dog Star, Sirius, the Blazing Star of the Freemasons and the celestial abode of Lucifer. As I detailed in 9/11 as Mass Ritual, the dazzling elaborate hugely-expensive opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 London 30^(th) (XXX) Olympics were globally-televised mass rituals (minus the human sacrifice) marking the grand celestial alignment, esoterically symbolized by the Triple Cross (XXX)… mere months from the 12/21/12 Mayan Doomsday date. We should, then, be thankful the psychopathic Luciferian global elite chose, for whatever reason(s), not to include the mass-human-sacrifice element in their in-plain-sight observance of the momentous 2012 Galactic Alignment, and that the danger presented by this Mother of All Auspicious Occasions is fully past… although, come to think of it, if you’ll recall, Galactic Alignment was not confined to the year 2012… S peaking of dangers that have (hopefully) fully past, the ever-elusive 9/11boogeyman Osama bin Laden, despite having the world’s top intelligence agencies and elite military units tracking him for the better part of a decade, managed to single-handedly further traumatize and terrorize the United States populace from half a world away with threats of an “American Hiroshima” – a supposed planned attack on one or more major American cities using a nuclear device or radiological “dirty bomb.” F or decades we’ve faced the threat of annihilation from global thermonuclear war – Mutually Assured Destruction (or aliens) seems to have kept that at bay. Rogue nation states such as Iran and North Korea also present an everpresent danger with regards to a nuclear attack and nuclear proliferation, although these bad geopolitical actors have also thus far been contained. Nuclear terrorism, on the other hand, a “kook with a nuke,” has emerged as an amorphous threat of which the global public lives in perpetual fear. Effective deterrents for nuclear terror are far more complex and elusive. As we all know from watching the historical documentary Zero Dark Thirty, the CIA-created former mujahideen warrior bin Laden was killed by Seal Team 6¹ in Pakistan, so there’s no longer any need to worry about his American Hiroshima.

E xactly how much time, though, should we spend worrying about nuclear war with Russia or China, or a more limited nuclear attack by Iran or North Korea, or an American-Hiroshima-style terror attack? These are all among the unsettling possible realities of modern life. Should we worry about these eventualities any more than, say, a global pandemic? Some scholars maintain that we remain as close, or have come even closer, to “nuclear midnight” than we were during the Cold War, but is this actually the case? There are obvious and powerful deterrents to attacks by other nations, and technologies for the detection of nuclear weapons and radiological materials such as might be utilized by terrorist groups have improved and proliferated dramatically in the last decade. ndeed, it would be wise to ask ourselves whether the most pressing threat of nuclear terrorism might instead be posed by those with the proven ability to manipulate the intelligence services and militaries of the world’s most powerful countries, as occurred on 9/11 – those whom have demonstrated the capacity and willingness to slaughter innocent civilians to advance their own nefarious causes? Keep in mind that false-flag attacks are not necessarily carried out by governments themselves, but frequently by shadow forces operating deep within its structure, manipulating it unseen. Sorry all you Bush haters…if you still think W. had the sense to pull off 9/11 by himself, you need to do your homework. To fully understand the strong interest in this astronomical phenomenon requires a great deal of background research and if, unlike myself, you have not devoted a considerable (and perhaps questionable) amount of time to this task and aren’t fully versed in the subject matter, I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. Fully accounting for the near-universal presence of the Zodiac dating back millennia in the many diverse cultures of the world, separated by vast amounts of time and geography, is a considerable task. The Zodiac plays an integral role in the identities and myth-making of a broad range of civilizations across eons. Why would this be so? The Zodiac has since time immemorial aided man in tracking the path of the sun through the sky on its annual circuit through the heavens. It has also performed a much less well-known purpose, one that was/is at the core of many mystery religions, and this esoteric knowledge was among the most closely guarded secrets of these hidden wisdom traditions.

In addition to its annual ‘timekeeping’ function, the Zodiac is also a Precessional Clock that allows us to track the passage of long stretches of time. As the earth wobbles slowly on its axis, the axis traces out a circle in the heavens, passing through all the signs of the Zodiac before returning to its starting position. This process of the great “Wheel in the Sky” going through one full rotation takes approximately 26,000 years. The Eternal Wisdom regards this “Great Age” and the beginning and ending of this repeating grand cycle. The end of one cycle marks the start of the next: that moment in time is the Alpha and the Omega. Was the end of the Mayan Fifth Age also the end of the Great Age, and how do we know when the Precessional Clock starts and stops? Recall from an earlier chapter that during Galactic Alignment “the sun, from our vantage point, lines up with the galactic equator near galactic center,” and that this occurs once every 26,000 years. Yes and no. Galactic Alignment is the marker for the end of the Great Age, but it was not completed on 12/21/12. Recall from earlier discussion that the alignment is a transition that occurs over a roughly 40-year period beginning around 1976,1 which means that it is not technically over until 2020-2021. Interesting. 4. The planetary power structure is primed for, and an extensive amount of groundwork has been laid for, an exponential leap forward into a full-blown technofascist global dictatorship – the true New World Order. We are one mass terror attack/mass sacrifice away from being plunged into the depths of tyranny. How to Create a Prison Planet in One Easy Step. Really, if you think about it, what better way could you come up with to greet the New Great Age and properly commemorate this once-in-a-26,000-year event than to slaughter countless innocent men, women and children in a mass sacrificial nuclear holocaust in honor of your Dark Lord – thereby dedicating the new cosmic cycle as the New Great Age of Satan while simultaneously shifting the machinery of global tyranny into overdrive?

They are centers of a mighty force, figures pregnant with an awful power, which, when properly fashioned, loose fiery whirlwinds upon the earth.” One not only has to learn the meaning behind the individual components of the language, but also the grammar and syntax. 9/11 as Mass Ritual deals with the “occult signature” of the event, the numbers and symbols employed that day, including the twin towers, the pentagon and the flight numbers of the planes involved. The book also discusses the astrology and numerology associated with this globally-televised black mass. But if you want any more background than that on those subjects, I’d invite you to read the book, because: a.) I don’t feel like repeating it all here; b.) we really have too much to cover to get into a lot of detail on all that right now; and, c.) I’m really a visual artist (art director, graphic designer), not a writer, and I’d rather show than tell. In fact, it would be better if you thought of me as your tour guide. I know a little about a lot of things – I can show you the major attractions and tell you the basic facts, but if you want a lot of details, read up afterwards. It’s far more important that we look at the big picture here and not get lost in the weeds. We’re going to look rather briefly at each individual landmark, and then move on to the next one. B efore we start scanning the environment and combing the landscape for clues, we need to have some idea what we’re looking for, and this relates directly to the question, When? When, by the reckoning of the Cryptocracy (because their opinion is truly the only one that matters), is The End, and, by extension, The Beginning? n order to have an idea what to look for, we also need to further understand the symbology associated with Galactic Alignment. I’ve already mentioned the XXX London Olympics and the Triple Cross – the three symbolic crosses formed by: 1.) the plane of the ecliptic (path of the sun through the sky) and the galactic equator (the centerline of the visible band of the Milky Way), known as the Great Cross, and, 2.) the rotational axes and equators of the earth and sun – all three crosses align during Galactic Alignment.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242523_cleaned.txt:9:83bf2f7bf721", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1012, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242523_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242523", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242523_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "need to further understand the symbology associated with Galactic Alignment.

As the Gospels record, two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on either side, thus the three crosses often associated with Christianity. Astronomically, in addition to the Great Cross, there is: Cygnus (the Latinized Hellenic Greek word for swan), lying on the plane of the Milky Way, which contains the Northern Cross; and, Crux (Latin for cross), with contains the Southern Cross – both of which are in close proximity to Galactic Center and lay on either side of the Great Cross. Compellingly, the Mayans also recognized two cross-shaped constellations in this same region (although they are not identical with Cygnus and Crux): “Xic,” the Hawk (hawk, swan, whatever) and The Thieves’ Cross (criminals, thieves, whatever) – both of which figured into Mayan myths focused on telling the unfolding story of the heavens, past, present and future. Other associated symbols include the Zodiacal signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius, located on either side of Galactic Center. Scorpio’s stinger and Sagittarius’ arrow both point directly at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which is often symbolized as a womb, as in the Womb of Creation, or skull (or skull cap); also, as a cosmic mountain or the throne of god. M any ancient cultures mapped the heavens onto the local landscape. Their great cities and monuments were built in a manner that reflected celestial features and the relationships of heavenly bodies. Kings were often viewed as manifestations or representatives of god, and often ruled from the City of God, A very interesting related question is this: If the elements and symbols associated with “precessional cosmology” are encoded in the historic and contemporary landscapes and built environments, might not knowledge of the cycle of precession, and perhaps even Galactic Alignment, be found there, as well? It was not uncommon to find a river flowing through these Cities of God that represented the Milky Way. Womb or birth imagery, symbolizing galactic center, was frequently utilized in various cultures. Myth-making often involved the use of precessional symbols and creatively told the unfolding story of the heavens and the turning of the Great Wheel in the Sky, which is completing yet another full turn in our era. ittle did I know it when I worked there, but Washington, DC, as I have L since come to learn, is filled with esoteric imagery – as well as celestial alignments in the street layout and architecture –", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242523_cleaned.txt:10:4e9a9430c295", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1013, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242523_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242523", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242523_cleaned", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "frequently utilized in various cultures.

Louis Farrakhan was on to something, after all (this is not to imply by any means that the conclusions he drew in his Million Man March speech were correct). As I researched and wrote about the attacks of 9/11 and related occult symbolism, the DC I knew so well took on an entirely new level of meaning. The Pentagon was of course one of the targets of the attacks, and the pentagon itself a powerful occult symbol – but, as it turns out, just one of many in the landscape of our nation’s capital. As I was to learn, the Washington Monument and Capitol Dome represent the phallus of Osiris and womb of Isis, but there is much, much more than I ever imagined in this place I thought I knew so well, including, as David Ovason points out in his book, The Secret Architecture of Our Nation’s Capital, over twenty complete zodiacs. N ow, I could provide a ton of additional detail here, and on other relatedsubjects throughout this book, but the truth is that you’re either going to believe the case I’m making or you’re not. Depending on your level of knowledge in the associated topics discussed herein, you’re either going to have an existing knowledge base that will assist you in assessing my claims, or you’re going to have to do additional reading – either way, you’re still going to have to decide for yourself.

December 21^(st) is, of course, the winter solstice, and in 2012, the precise time of the solstice, I wrote, “as listed on the U.S. Naval Observatory’s website for years in advance, was 11:11 Universal Time.” Thus, according to the faulty contemporary mythology, or urban legend, the exact moment of Galactic Alignment was 11:11 on 12/21/12. (We’ve been over the fact that Galactic Alignment has been occurring over the past 40 some odd years – and, in reality, the year in which the visual alignment was most precise was way back in 1998. More on that later.) As I observed in the book, “New Agers and spiritualists went absolutely bonkers over this seeming super-synchronistic Message from the Matrix… the Universe was speaking to us. Entire books were written on the subject and there were more 11:11 YouTube videos than you could shake a stick at.” Continuing, Nobody stopped to consider the alternative explanation: that, as opposed to being a loving message from the Creator indicating the impending ascension of mankind, this was yet another indicator of the exact depth of the tyranny humanity was now living under – a tyranny so pervasive that it extended into every aspect of our lives, of our existence, including time itself. Winter solstice: December 21^(st) . 12/21. 11:11. If that looks strangely like a code to you, your instincts are correct… Do you not think that, being the insane control freaks they have repeatedly shown themselves to be, the Illuminati had some ingenious scheme for counting up (or counting down) to this most momentous of occasions…? I referred to 25641 as the Illuminati SuperNumber and as “a mathematical alchemical formulation capable of transmuting its very nature, much like the mythical phoenix. It is 777 and 33, the number of God and the number of Christ, and simultaneously 77 and 333, the number of Satan and the number of [the demon] Choronzon.” Even more pertinently, however, is that this number is very close to the approximate 26,000 years of the Great Age. While it is certainly true that any number of educated folk have speculated on the exact length of the Great Year, there is no widely-accepted answer – even if there was, how the hell would you know when to start the clock?

What I was not aware of at the time I wrote about the end-of-days code in 2011 is that famed occultist Dr. John “the Original 007” Dee (1527-1608), Queen Elizabeth I’s court advisor and astrologer (and the foremost scientific genius of the 16^(th) century) at one time had proposed an official calendar based on sets of 33 years. Although this idea didn’t originate with Dee, the calendar had certain advantages and theological-occult implications, but was officially rejected at the time. Was it, or some form of it, adopted by the Cryptocracy? From an occult perspective, the attractiveness of a 33-based time-keeping system cannot be overstated. But consider this, as well. Here we have a system that tracks 21 sets of 1221 – with 12/21 corresponding to December 21^(st) , the winter solstice, the day that the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, the annual symbolic “death” of the sun. (This is also the traditional date when the position of the sun against the backdrop of the Zodiac and Milky Way is measured and recorded for posterity – for the purposes of tracking its progress through the heavens and determining what time it is on the Precessional Clock.) KABOOM! But hold on, this won’t necessarily be the date of the aforementioned hypothetical global nuclear false flag attack (although it’d sure seem like the opportune moment, but there’s more to consider on this point). The real bombshell here is that on December 21^(st) , 2021, the date itself encodes the numbers of the cycle, and the Number of Completion – and that this of icially marks the End of the Great Age. Above is the ancient “Magic Square of the Sun,” and I could explain it in detail, but you can look at the diagram and glean the important points: every row, and both diagonals, adds to 111, and the sum of the rows both vertically and horizontally is 666, which is thus closely associated with pagan sun worship (and is, of course, the number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation).

A couple of days (or weeks, or months, or even years) here or there over the course of 26 millennia … pphht, who cares? Our rulers are insanely creative and they do not perform on cue. Whatever we think they might do, they almost certainly will not. They are infinitely smarter than us – who are we to think that we can figure out their incredibly well-laid and Satan-kissed plans in advance? But, if I had to guess… I’d rule out December 22^(nd) , 23^(rd) and 24^(th). , although the ancient Roman Saturnalia festival did run from December 17 to the 23^(rd) . I’d also rule out Christmas Day as the official start of the New Great Age, although a massive nuclear false flag attack on this day would most certainly desecrate this highest of Christian holidays for all eternity. Even at that, it still seems a little too obvious. M ost are unaware that our New Year begins when Sirius reaches its zenithin mid-heaven at mid-night. And I believe it is much more likely that the Cryptocracy would greet the first zenith attainment of Sirius in the New Great Age and use this as its Official Welcome, rather than greeting the first rising of the reborn sun on Christmas Day in the dawning Great Year. Our masters do not worship the sun. They worship Sirius. Also note that there may be no attacks on NYE-NYD 2021-2022. Even if I’m entirely correct about the significance of these dates to the Cryptocracy, that doesn’t automatically mean that they’ll stage a false flag then. Attempting to predict their intentions or actions with any degree of accuracy is a futile exercise, a fact that I’ve learned repeatedly over the years. Similarly, as we will see, a specific geographic location can be considered to represent not just the physical center of heaven, the City of God, but also the center of time. The Alpha and the Omega. The beginning and the end. The completion of one cycle concurrent with the initiation of the next. One full revolution of the wheel. One full circuitous journey through the signs of the Zodiac. This Celestial City was designed in the ancient tradition. Like Stonehenge and innumerable sites and cities since, it is aligned with the summer and winter solstices, and DC’s streets and architecture encode various other astronomical features and alignments.

R ecall that Dr. John Dee’s Illuminati Precessionaltracking of blocks of 111 years. Counting up, that’ s 21 x 11 x 111 = 25641 e. Counting down, on the other hand, by sets of 111 to the end of the Great Age as marked by the year of most-precise Galactic Alignment, 1998, the final set of 111 would begin in 1887. Ah ha! But what does that mean? The year 1887 saw the first Groundhog Day observed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, and the first Glenfiddich single-malt Scotch whisky produced. Much more significantly, it was also the year of the founding of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, of which famed occultist Aleister Crowley was a member. However, this last item could have merely been coincidence (although anyone familiar with Crowley would have to wonder), and thus the year 1887 might well signify absolutely nothing. No, what we want to do is back up another 111 years, which puts us at, yes, 1776 – which would mean that the founding of America was timed to coincide with the initiation of the last two cycles of 111 on the long count down to the End of All Things. Seventeen seventy six: 222 years to Galactic Alignment, and counting. Y es, but… 1998 was not the end of all things, of course, and nothing even happened that year that could have been part of a celebration or commemoration by the Cryptocracy to mark the occasion… right? I’m fairly certain (positive, actually) that you’ll want to withhold judgment on that last point until later on, but remember this: we aren’t necessarily looking for a single countdown to a single date or year. We are talking about the end of the Great Age, a once-in-a-26,000-year occasion. The elite may well have established multiple countdowns, marking the opening of the Galactic Alignment window (which, by the way, was 1976),1 the “precise” moment of Galactic Alignment itself in 1998, and the closing of the window in 2021-2022.

As fate would have it, Mr. Olson was born on September 11, 1940, and, as fate would also have it, Olson’s third wife, Barbara, just happened to be a passenger on hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 – which, on September 11, 2001, crashed into the Pentagon, for which the groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 11, 1941. George Washington, before he became known much more recently through insanely-liberal revisionist history as primarily a slave-owning honky possessed of copious quantities of white privilege, was formerly widely recognized as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and as the nation’s first Washington was also a Master Mason and shortly before becoming our first president was elected the first Worshipful Master of Alexandria Lodge No. 22. In taking the presidential oath of office, Washington used the Bible of the St. John’s Masonic Lodge No. 1 of New York, and prominent Mason and Chancellor of New York Robert Livingston administered the oath. R emember, the grand alignment doesn’t take place at the precise center of the Milky Way’s nuclear bulge, but about 6 degrees to one side along the Galactic Equator (GE) where it is intersected by the plane of the ecliptic (sun’s path through the sky, PE), which forms the Great Cross. (Note that this is not necessarily a vertical, perpendicular cross: the GE and PE do not meet at a right angle.) Where to look for a symbolic representation of the Great Cross? Well, obviously there are more intersecting streets in DC than you can shake a stick at. Let’s narrow it down a bit, and look for a major thoroughfare representing the Galactic Equator, originating at or passing through the U.S. Capitol (Galactic Center) and intersected by a street representing the plane of the ecliptic. Maryland Avenue Southwest originates directly in front of the Capitol, and is intersected by exactly zero major thoroughfares before terminating near the Tidal Basin (okay, technically it ends in a roundabout). Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest likewise originates at the Capitol and runs almost directly into the White House grounds. If extended to the White House itself, it would be intersected there by New York Avenue Northwest if it, too, were extended a short distance to the White House.

Yes, more or less. And by extension, I am proposing that the White House and its immediate grounds represent the 40-year window of Galactic Alignment. Laughable? As a matter of fact, it is, but I’ll warn you – if you get too literal with all this, you’re gonna be frustrated and disappointed. (I knoooow that there’s only a small section of NY Ave to the west of the White House.) I’m not asking you to suspend your rational faculties, I’m telling you not to be anal-retentive. All of this, you have to keep in mind, is a damn joke on some profound level. Our sun has travelled northwest up NY Ave, has already moved largely off of the Great White House Cross and is about to clear the imaginary Galactic Equator (represented by the non-existent section of Pennsylvania Avenue running diagonally through the White House). It will be completely beyond the equator of the Milky Way by the close of 2021, and thus by the beginning of 2022 the alignment will be officially over and the New Great Age will be set to So, if I’m correct about all this, what do you think that the zip code of the block immediately to the east of the White House – 1500 Pennsylvania Ave NW, home to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, towards which the rapidly setting imaginary sun of our current Great Year is headed – would be? 20220. Zip-a-dee Doo-Dah. Thank you very much. The White House is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If 16^(th) Street NW didn’t dead end into Lafayette Square, which sits to the immediate north of the White House, it would run directly through it.

The entire 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue represents the window of Galactic Alignment, which spans 40 years, give or take a little: 25, 600 + 41= 25,641. Pretty simple, and pretty plain, don’t you think? (If you wanna haggle over plus-or-minus one year across the span of almost 26 centuries, be my guest. But keep this in mind: 25,641 can also be expressed as 4²x40²+40+1 …very Biblical.) But is not the Omega one with the Alpha, the end of the old cycle simultaneously the beginning of the new? Is this not the Zero Point? It is, and, similarly, as we count up, we also count down, to zero. And lo and behold, what do we find directly across the street from the South Lawn of the White House but The winged helmet of Mercury, god of travel, is found on the Zero Milestone. The Roman Mercury, Greek Hermes and Egyptian Thoth are all held to be manifestations of the same deity, with Thoth being “the reckoner of times and seasons,” a god of the measurement and regulation of events and of time itself. Originally envisioned as the American equivalent to Rome’s Golden Milestone, or Milliarium Aureum, from which all roads were considered to begin and all distances in the Roman Empire measured, the Zero Milestone never realized its stated purpose, and currently only roads in the Washington, D.C., area are measured from it. Return to the aforementioned Lafayette Square, which, before it became a public park, was used as a racetrack, a graveyard, a zoo and a slave market. The square was designed by Andrew Jackson Downing (pictured above right), considered to be a founder of American landscape architecture. Look closely at its design from an aerial perspective. It rather resembles some magic symbol, don’t you think? A planetary seal, perhaps? Or, maybe the design is simply what popped into Downing’s head when he sat down to draw up a plan. Consider this, however. The White House and grounds are The Place of Crossing, where the sun and earth align at the Great Cross. What would it look like if we combined the astrological earth symbol and the Seal of the Sun? Pretty darn close. (Okay, you tell me how you would better translate the combined symbols into the design for a public park. If you can do it, I’ll kiss your foot.)

These two joined elements form a gargantuan magic sigil in the landscape, esoterically branding this location as the The Place of Crossing, which we already know it to be. How’s that for tangible? You’ll note the planetary symbols for Venus to the immediate left of the center of the X and Mars to the right – and since we all know which planet orbits the sun between Venus and Mars, this would seem to indicate that we are to infer that the Earth is sitting dead center of the X. But we don’t have to infer it. We know from the last chapter/sidebar that the planetary symbol for Earth is a cross within a circle, but this symbol is not present. However, that is only one of the symbols used to represent our planet. Another is a stylized globus cruciger (Latin for “cross-bearing orb”), but that’s obviously not present, either. Long before its adoption by Christianity as its primary symbol, the cross – which we see in the image sitting directly above, and anchored in, the Xs center point – was used by a wide range of spiritual traditions to represent a variety of things, including, unsurprisingly, the Earth. The four arms of the cross can be seen to represent the four cardinal directions, and also the cross formed by Earth’s equator and axis. F eel free to challenge my interpretation of these elements. After all, theplanetary sign for Venus is also the female gender symbol, just as the sign for Mars is the male gender symbol. And perhaps if the cross does represent Christ/Christianity here, the “S” represents Satan/Satanism. The lower half of the Venus sign is oddly elongated, suggesting an inverted cross, a key symbol in Satan worship. Namely, was Berkowitz solely responsible for all of the killings attributed to him (even those that he confessed to and had detailed knowledge of)? Many books have been written on this case, including quite a few that challenge the official “lone gunman” storyline, and there are some compelling indications that Berkowitz had accomplices. Beyond this, there are indications not simply that there were other people involved, but that there were dark ritualistic dimensions to the slayings.

A s previously mentioned, one of the general symbols for Galactic Center is a womb, and, more specifically, the Womb of Isis. Horus is the son of Isis (and Osiris, sort of…it’s kinda hard to sire offspring without a penis), and he most often depicted as a falcon or as a man with a falcon head – even his hieroglyph was a falcon. Falcon, 44 and Galaxy. If you want to accuse me of cherry picking details to support my pet theory, that’s your right, but before you do, you should thoroughly familiarize yourself with the numerous synchronistic elements of the case (which you can chalk up to mere coincidence if you’re so inclined, or to conspiracy, or Satan, I don’t care). I’m not going to attempt to list them all here, but I’ll go over some of the more pertinent ones. Okay, that one could be coincidence (although I’d wait until reading the endnote at the end of this chapter before making a decision on this), but he also referenced “Wicked King Wicker,” prompting police to arrange a private screening of the 1973 horror movie starring Christopher Lee entitled, The Wicker Man – the plot of which, as most of you probably know, revolves around ritual sacrificial murder.

Speaking of Behemoths, I probably don’t need to elaborate on this, but, as I wrote on page 124 of 9/11 as Mass Ritual, “In 2000, the year in which Bonesman G.W. Bush was elected, the Republican logo was changed from its original configuration, left, to the one shown on the right – with three inverted pentagrams – which is still in use.” avid Berkowitz initially claimed that he was taking orders from a demon-possessed black Labrador retriever named Sam (the dog was actually named Harvey), and, further, that he’d attempted to kill the dog but was thwarted by supernatural means.

Was the demon dog story a crafty strategy to embed the Sirius meme into the Son of Sam Mass Ritual? I’d bet so (although there’s actually much more going on than meme-making, I’ll elaborate on that soon) – and then there’s this: in December 1976, Berkowitz killed a dog named Rocket (hey, not bad if you’re going for broke with the whole Inter-Galactic Freak Show thing, Jack Parsons would be proud) at 18 Wicker Street. Two days later, three German shepherds were found in a gutter adjacent to…Wicker Street. ot to be overlooked in all this is that, in the early fifth century, Latin philosopher Macrobius, whose most important work is the Saturnalia, noted in his Chronicon that the annual ancient Egyptian celebration of Horus was held on the winter solstice, a fact backed up by Epiphanius of Salamis in his most significant work, the Panarion. Winter solstice, December 21^(st) , 12/21…1221…our Fiddle Dee Dee Precessional Clock is set to “Horus Time”! Also, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, “In his letters to police, Berkowitz referenced ‘The Twenty Two Disciples of Hell’, and, in 1976, twenty two years remained until the most precise moment of Galactic Alignment in 1998.” Adding 22 to 1998, we arrive at 2020, the last full year of the current Great Age (2021 is the Year of Transition, since, technically, the End of the Great Age is 12/21/21 – in Horus Time). 1. Surely I am not suggesting that Berkowitz was somehow chosen for his role, in part or in large, because of his birth name… hell, ask Berkowitz himself, who stated in a letter withheld from scrutiny for four years by police, “I David Berkowitz have been chosen since birth, to be one of the executioners of the cult.” So there. 2.

Referencing the images below, as the earth’s and sun’s orientation to the Galactic Equator (GE) change during the Cycle of Precession, the angles formed by the earth’s equinoctial and solstitial axes in relation to GE vary substantially. As we and our star approach Galactic Alignment, the solstitial axis becomes increasingly parallel to GE and the equinoctial axis increasingly perpendicular, and during the alignment, a cross is formed by the latter axis and the GE. It is variously referred to as the Precessional Cross and the Erect Cross. You can see that in its symbolic form, the Erect Cross is essentially identical to (see images below) the planetary symbol for Earth, which of course we’re already familiar with … or, a set of rifle-scope crosshairs … or, a Celtic cross … or, even this last image, which might simply look like a hand-drawn Celtic cross, but, as you’re most likely aware, is in fact something altogether more sinister. It is, of course, the symbol used by the Zodiac Killer (whose work pre-dated the Son of Sam murders by about 10 years) as his signature. Investigators concluded that the Zodiac killer had adopted the symbol because it was the logo used by the watchmaker of the same name – certainly a logical conclusion. [] (Left) The Clint Eastwood classic Dirty Harry drew upon the Zodiac Killer case and featured this classic line: “…being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean of , you’ve gotta ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?” (Far right) The case even inspired a 1971 porn flick featuring the legendary John Holmes. The case of the Zodiac Killer – which remains unsolved, only adding to its continuing valence – has over the past half century had such a powerful and lasting influence on the American psyche that it would be difficult to quantify its impact. It has inspired hundreds of books, movies and television programs, even influencing popular music.

Implanting “the most relevant memes and symbols” is not a goal unto itself, but rather a means to an end. In Secret Societies, Hoffman observes that “ritual murder is mind control,” and refers to the machinery of manipulation as “a technological tyranny so immense it is difficult to grasp. It is both a physical, technological tyranny as well as a tyranny of the mind,” and involves “psycho-spiritual warfare methods hyped by ‘coincidence,’ symbolism and ritual.” Hoffman explains that it is the subconscious mind that is being targeted in occult ritual. “In occult crimes the objective is not linear,” he states, “that is to say, is not solely bound to the achievement of the immediate effects of the attack on the victim, but may in fact be a part of a larger, symbolic ritual magnified by the power of the electronic media, for the purpose of the alchemical processing of the subconscious Group Mind of the masses.” Hoffman continues, telling us that “it is the subconscious that is being addressed in occult ritual, in a process CIA behavioral scientist Dr. Ewan Cameron termed, ‘psychic driving’.” “The induction of terror into the mass mind of Americans in association with certain key-words and key-symbols or ‘sigils’ in connection with controlsymbols,” Hoffman states, “is the most efficacious means of ensuring a braindead and mind-controlled, subject population.” He continues, asserting that “symbolism embedded within terrorism and achieved with seeming invincible accomplishment by ‘invisible’ principals, is a great way to control and process people.” “The Black Arts adepts who wear police badges, occupy judge’s seats and media editor’s desks,” he concludes, “are not simply ‘crazed’, nor are such intensely publicized ritual murders merely superstitious sacrifices to some kooky devil-god.” They are in fact “a brilliantly orchestrated ritual whose ceremonial aspects were as precise and detailed as the internal workings of a clock,” and constitute an “alchemical psychodrama for the processing of humanity.” The issue of controlling humanity with esoteric words and symbols encoded within a play, a media spectacular or a ritual is one of the most difficult for people to comprehend. …Even as [modern man] dances to the tune of the elite managers of human behavior, he scoffs with great derision at the idea of the existence and operation of a technology of mass mind control emanating from the media and government.

Led by William Kristol, former Vice-President Dan Quayle’s chief-of-staff, the magazine, although less well known outside the Beltway than National Review, had significant influence in the halls of Washington, with its writers and editors becoming a ubiquitous presence in the local and national media. F or the two years since the publication’s inception in 1995, weekly staff meetings had generally been a fairly low-key routine, with lively-but-civil discussions regarding domestic and foreign policy, sociocultural matters and the like, rarely progressing beyond any subject that would require more than a PG rating. Beginning in the third week of January, 1998, however, this would change to a degree that I wouldn’t have imagined possible just several weeks earlier. On January 17^(th). , news of the Monica Lewinsky scandal first broke on the Drudge Report, and our staff meetings would soon of necessity include the tawdry details of the affair, including semen-stained blue dresses, which direction the Commander-in-Chief’s member lists (to port, if I recall correctly), and which objects he did or did not insert in his former intern’s vagina (cigar, yes; penis, no). The Year of the Grand Alignment, in the most visible Earthly counterpart of the Celestial City/Cosmic Mountain, upon which the eyes of the world are perpetually fixed, and all we get is a lousy sex scandal, spawning news stories by the thousands filled with details about the penis of the Most Powerful Man in the Kingdom/World, a cigar-as-phallus, the young lady’s vagina, semen, the White House (geographic parallel to the cosmic Place of Crossing)… hey, wait a minute… In one of the more popular versions of the Osiris myth, the god is killed and dismembered by his brother Set, after which Osiris’ sister-wife Isis is able to locate all his body parts, except his penis. She then fashions a substitute phallus and magically inseminates herself, subsequently giving birth to Horus.

P.S.: Speaking of playing the part, Clinton made a big production about not having actually had “sexual relations” with Monica Lewinsky (according to a strict legal interpretation of the term), employing tortured logic and twisted semantics in an attempt to argue his point. Personally, I find it a little difficult to believe that Slick Willie – serial philanderer, adulterer and rapist (one might even add pedophile to this list; Google Jeffrey Epstein, Orgy Island and The Lolita Express), who left a trail of victims with chewed-up lips from Little Rock to D.C. – all of a sudden grew a conscience about porking an intern in the Oval Office, and I suspect that entire routine was designed to invoke the Isis-as-the-Great-Virgin meme. But I could be wrong. On August 20^(th) , 1998, three days after President Clinton testified before the grand jury in the Lewinsky scandal, a series of missiles were launched against suspected terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan as part of Operation Infinite Reach. That same day had also concluded Lewinsky’s second day of testimony before the grand jury, and pre-announced Special Reports on this topic were preempted by breaking news of the missile attacks. Astute observers (as well as not-so-astute, because it was completely obvious) noted with some incredulity the striking parallel between this episode and the plot of the recently released movie, Wag the Dog, in which a spin doctor and a Hollywood producer fabricate a war in Albania in order to distract voters from a sex scandal involving the U.S. President less than two weeks before an election. As if that weren’t enough, the exact same comparison was made again in December following Operation Desert Fox in Iraq, a four-day bombing campaign that occurred at precisely the same time that the U.S. House of Representatives was conducting the impeachment hearing of President Clinton. In fact, Clinton was formally impeached on December 19^(th) , the final day of the military operation. The justification given for the strikes in Iraq was their failure to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions and its interference with U.N. Special Commission inspectors, but in reality both the rationale and the impact of the operation were suspect.

There were accusations of U.S. interference in the U.N. inspection process, including infiltration of the inspection teams by CIA and MI6 operatives. So, to be clear, is what I’m telling you that Wag the Dog was predictive programming prefiguring the attacks in Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq, which were ostensibly intended to distract the public and the media from the Lewinsky sex scandal but actually ended up drawing more attention to them – and that the movie contained specific details later mirrored in reality, down to Monica’s hat? That’s precisely what Γm telling you, and I’ll go even further – not only is the above true, but all this was coordinated on a meta-level as part of the Cryptocracy’s perverse Galactic Alignment Soirée, which, as you know, is all about the rebirth of the sun, kinda like Christmas; the U.S. release date, incidentally, of Wag the Dog. Y ou know, I could speculate about Kenneth Starr’s role in this whole affair, and ask what the significance of the Starr Report being released on September 11, 1998, was (although we already know that date is all about Sirius), or whether Starr’s last name was in fact an insiders’ reference to the Dog Star, or whether the “White Water” investigation was code for “Milky Way,” or speculate about his post-Special-Counsel gig as chancellor of Baylor University in Waco, Texas, site of the slaughter of the Branch Davidians… A recently-released memo shows that then-associate-counsel-to-the-independent-counsel (Kenneth Starr) and now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested a list of sexually-graphic questions to ask Bill Clinton in Clinton’s grand-jury testimony about his af air with Monica Lewinsky. What goes around comes around, huh, Brett – Devil’s Triangle, anyone? 1 In one such ancient Egyptian fertility ritual, a public procession led by the Pharaoh would march down to the Nile, where nation’s leader would disrobe, masturbate and ejaculate into the river, symbolically imbuing it with living-giving powers.

A couple of hundred miles from Lockerbie is Loch Ness, Scotland (and, no,I’m not about to try to tie the Loch Ness Monster in with all this). In November 1899, Aleister Crowley purchased the Boleskine House in Foyers on the shore of Loch Ness. He fastly developed a love of Scottish culture, referring to himself as the “Laird of Boleskine,” and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London. During his lifetime, Crowley was involved with many occult groups, including the Freemasons. Around 1904, he was initiated into Craft Freemasonry,1 and his mother lodge – as recognized under the jurisdiction of the Grande Loge Nationale Française in Paris as of 1964 – is Anglo-Saxon Lodge No. 103. One-o-three. peaking of old houses with interesting histories, Lockerbie House (located in…) was built in 1814 for Sir William Douglas, and was inhabited by a number of members of the Douglas family S through the years, including John Sholto Douglas, who became the 9^(th) Marquess of Queensberry and is the namesake of the “Marquess of Queensberry rules” in boxing. Douglas is also remembered as a devout atheist, as well as for his outspoken views, brutish manner and his role in the downfall of author and playwright Oscar Wilde. Douglas’ third son, Lord Alfred “Bosie,” was a close friend and lover of Wilde, and Queensberry’s efforts to terminate their relationship led to his famous dispute with the author. Eventually, the offending portion of the sculpture was covered with a bronze butterfly-shaped ornament, and the monument was unveiled in August 1914, with Aleister Crowley presiding over the ceremony. The unveiling was absent the sculptor, who was highly displeased with the alteration to his creation. I saw that there was only one thing to be done in the interests of common decency and respect for Epstein. I detached the butterfly and put it under my waistcoat. The gate keeper did not notice how portly I had become. When I reached London, I put on evening dress and affixed the butterfly to my own person in the same way as previously to the statue, in the interests of modesty, and then marched into the Café Royal, to the delight of the assembled multitude. Epstein himself happened to be there and it was a glorious evening.

The film was widely criticized by authorities, and of course it would be, but it doesn’t really matter if this alternate account is true or not – or even which of the multiple existing conspiracy theories might be accurate. The truth is, there may be multiple theories which contain partially correct information, with none of them being perfectly on target. We have left Lockerbie, Scotland, and are in Peggy’s Cove, Nova Scotia – “New Scotland” – watching Swissair Flight 111 plunge into the waters of St. Margarets Bay roughly five miles from shore. The plane has suffered a catastrophic failure due to an electrical fire, and the resulting disaster kills all iven the sinister nature of this whole year-long Galactic Freak Show G Charade-Celebration, one could readily view the deaths of those killed in all three countries as human sacrifices. The motives behind, and timing of, each of the attacks were legitimately called into question: their impact from a military perspective was highly limited, if not altogether negligible (although the resulting destabilization of Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq did have some longerterm strategic value); and, as we’ve explored, they could well have been part of an concerted effort to distract the public’s and the media’s attention from an ongoing sex scandal. However, since we have exposed the true purpose and nature of that scandal as a globally-televised Egyptian Fertility Ritual Dark Comedy Series, we can be certain that these related deaths were in fact part of an act of mass human sacrifice, as were the deaths of the passengers and crew of those aboard Swissair Flight 111. How can we be sure of the latter, you might ask? I had hoped you weren’t going to make me do this…. I’m going to quickly point out, merely as a refresher, that 11x111 = 1221 . And third, with apologies in advance, I’m going to inform you that on September 2^(nd) , 1998, the number of days remaining until December 21^(st) , Galactic Alignment Proper, were, to quote Bilbo Baggins, “eleventy-one” – one-hundred and eleven. 1-1-1.

In this tragedy too, conspiracy theories concerning a missile, possibly fired from a U.S. Navy vessel, circulated widely. In both instances, the record of scheduled military exercises shows planned air and sea operations for the weeks of the crashes. Despite the compelling similarities between these two cases, however, the primary point I want to make regarding TWA Flight 800, in context of our broader discussion, is this: the crash of Swissair 111 occurred exactly 777 days from the crash of TWA Flight 800… and, if for whatever reason that’s not good enough for you, try this on: 800 + 111 = 911.9 –1 –1.9/1. . The list of suspects who may be responsible for the complex engineering of Oak Island’s underground vault(s) and system of flood tunnels, as well as the abundant esoteric symbols and imagery discovered in numerous locations, includes, unsurprisingly, the Knights Templar and the Freemasons (or some combination thereof). Certain elements of the Money Pit are claimed to correspond to one or more Masonic initiation rites involving the legend of Enoch and a hidden vault with a sacred treasure (Google “The Royal Arch of Enoch”), although there is some indication that the details which support this theory were fabricated. Indeed, one cannot dismiss entirely the possibility that the entire Oak Island legend may be an elaborate hoax perpetrated by the Freemasons. Regardless of what the truth may be, the legend lives on, as does the memory of what occurred on September 2^(nd) , 1998, precisely 777 days from the crash of TWA 800, and a few miles off the shore of nearby Peggy’s Cove – which, incidentally, sits exactly 777 miles from the U.S. Capitol, ie.

If 16^(th) Street NW didn’t dead end into Lafayette Square, which sits to the immediate north of the White House, it would run directly through it. Multiplying 1600 by 16 yields 25,600, a mere 41 units short of the length of the Illuminati Great Year. Coincidence? The entire 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue represents the window of Galactic Alignment, which spans 40 years, give or take a little: 25, 600 + 41 = 25, 641 . Pretty simple, and pretty plain, don’t you think? (If you wanna haggle over plus or minus one year across the span of almost 26 centuries, be my guest. But keep this in mind: 25,641 can also be expressed as 4²x40² + 40 + 1 …very Biblical.) Besides the obvious fact of 444 being the product of 4 times 111, and the less obvious fact of 1776 being the product of 4 times 444, there is the aforementioned expression of the Great Age’s Number of Completion (25,641) as $4 ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { x } 4 0 ^ { 2 } \\substack { + 4 0 + 1 }$ . (That’s a lot of fours…and here’s three more: the number 1980, the year of Reagan’s election, is the product of 44 times 45.) W ashington, DC, was laid out as a 10-mile square, with boundary stones set at each of the four corners. The center of this square is approximately in the middle of the block to the immediate east of the White House Ellipse (between 17^(th) and 18^(th) Streets NW on Constitution Avenue), although to my knowledge there’s nothing at that location to mark the spot (if you don’t count the Art Museum of the Americas). The symbolic, functional center of Washington is formed by the north-south center axis of the White House and the east-west center axis of the U.S. Capitol (which is different from the geographic center of D.C., but this is irrelevant to our discussion).

The date of Easter each year hinges upon the time of the vernal equinox, which is ecclesiastically set as March 21 st, although in reality, on the Gregorian calendar it shifts over the 400-year leap-year cycle between March 19^(th) and 21^(st) . From the church’s perspective, a calendar which kept the equinox on March 21^(st) would be by far preferable. “God’s Chosen Meridian,” as it is also been called, corresponds to the 77^(th) meridian west ( 77^(∘) west of Greenwich), the meridian on which Washington, D.C., is located. Is this the reason, or one of the reasons, that Thomas Jefferson sought to establish a new Prime Meridian through the heart of Washington, D.C. – because he believed that this meridian was “God’s Longitude”? The D.C. Square measures 52,800 feet on each side, while the length of the New Jerusalem’s four walls are given as 12,000 stadia each. The number 52,800 divided by 12,000 equals 4.4, although this operation obviously isn’t a conversion of units. (Quite frankly, I hesitate to mention this point, and wouldn’t, if not for the previously-established extreme importance of the number 44.) Although, you’ll have to admit that stamping the future Capital of the Free World with Horus’ special number (even a slight variation thereof) – as a direct affront to Yahweh, whose number is 26 – in order to commemorate the Aeon of Horus on the cusp of the New Great Age has a helluva lot of appeal. Horus City. A s discussed in a previous chapter, the White House and grounds representthe Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, the completion of one great cycle and the start of the next. It is the terrestrial counterpart of the Celestial Great Cross, and one could also say that it represents the Center of Time. The White House itself sits only slightly more than a half-mile due north from the Jefferson Pier, the Heart of D.C., which, like the White House, could also be said to represent the Heart of Time. The White House corresponds to ground zero of an astronomical alignment which marks the Shift of the Great Age, and the Heart of D.C. corresponds to a zero point in time (0^(∘)0^(∘) = 00 : 00) .

The Heart of D.C., the Heart of Time, a Window of Time: if these are all are artifacts of an overactive mind, then why at this very location do we find two striking objects which, to the untrained eye, are merely national monuments, but to those with eyes to see, represent something far different – and all about time? Was the end of the Mayan Fifth Age also the end of the Great Age, and how do we know when the Precessional Clock starts and stops? Recall from an earlier chapter that during Galactic Alignment “the sun, from our vantage point, lines up with the galactic equator near galactic center,” and that this occurs once every 26,000 years. The Maya developed over-lapping, inter-locking calendars tracking sets of 260, 360 and 365 days. A baktun lasted 144,000 days, thus 13 baktun equaled 1,872,000 days. This is approximately 5,125 years using a 365-day calendar, but it is precisely 5,200 years on a 360-day calendar. Five Mayan ages would thus be 9,360,000 days in duration – exactly 26,000 years on a 360-day calendar (which in Biblical context is referred to as a “prophetic year”). So what? It is striking and beyond coincidence that these same numbers can be found in the Book of Revelation. Recall that the length of each wall of the New Jerusalem is 12,000 stadia, and scripture also states that the width of the walls is 144 cubits. Twelve thousand multiplied by 144 equals 1,728,000 – 144,000 short of the number of days in a Mayan age. But, wait – the walls of the city have twelve foundations. The twelve foundations multiplied by the length of each wall, 12,000, equals 144,000. The number of each of the four vertical walls is thus 1,872,000, and don’t forget about the floor of the city. Five surfaces, five times 1,872,000…the number of days in the Great Age. Time encoded as distance (or other physical measurement): The New Jerusalem Date Cube.

(We won’t even get into all of the other astrotheological imagery in the rest of the last chapter of the Bible.) And then there’s this: the description of the New Jerusalem is found in Revelation Chapter 21, verses 12- 21. Just for fun, let’s all repeat: 12 x 1221 = 25641 . The monument is a massive Phallus of Osiris, and so much more. Much has been made of the height of the monument, 555.5 feet (I knooow that it’s listed as 555^(′)5.125^(′′) according to the NPS’s 1884 measurement, don’t haggle with me), and the fact that this translates into 6,666 inches. One should also note that 555.5 is also exactly half of 1111, which we’ve seen before as 11:11. Potentially of even greater significance in this context is that, according to legend, the date when the nine founders of what would become the Knights Templar first assembled is 1,111 A.D. (If you want to confirm this, you can call the White House main line at 202-456-1111.) Additionally, the distance from the southern portico of the White House to the center of the Jefferson Memorial dome is 1.11 miles: the Washington Monument sits precisely at the mid-point of this distance, .555 miles. (The length of each side of the base of the monument is 55 feet and some change, and the batter or slope of the outer surface is 0.247 inches per foot, or 1^(∘)11^(∘) .) n the historic architectural renderings for the Washington Monument, you will find that the original depth of the foundation for the obelisk was 23^(∘)4^(∘) feet. (The structure was initially constructed with a foundation of this depth, but it subsequently had to be deepened and reinforced to support the enormous weight of the monument.) This is very interesting, given the role of the foundation of the New Jerusalem Date Cube, and given the “Mathematical Shorthand for the Apocalypse” revealed at the end of the sidebar, because what 23.4 (I know 23^(∘)4^(∘) and 23.4 ′ aren’t exactly the same, we’re not doing conversions, dammit) gives us is, in fact, According to the official government version of events, Islamic terrorists bring down Flight 93, killing all aboard … and the memorial designers propose a crescent-shaped design highly evocative of the Islamic crescent and named “The Crescent of Embrace.” There are even claims that the Crescent of Embrace, as it was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242523_cleaned.txt:34:22cc3e055911", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1037, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242523_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242523", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242523_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "revealed at the end of the sidebar, because what 23.4 (I know 23^(∘)4^(∘) and 23.4 ′ aren’t exactly the same, we’re not doing conversions, dammit) gives us is, in fact, According to the official government version of events, Islamic terrorists bring down Flight 93, killing all aboard … and the memorial designers propose a crescent-shaped design highly evocative of the Islamic crescent and named “The Crescent of Embrace.” There are even claims that the Crescent of Embrace, as it was originally proposed and would have been oriented in the landscape, pointed directly to Mecca, a common practice in Islamic architecture. (One researcher has taken this concept a major step further by making a quite compelling case that the entire memorial was actually designed as the world’s largest open-air mosque.) A giant clock cabinet key. At the Center of Time. That’s just too good for words. Combine it with the fact that it is supposed to be a monument to the fallen American heroes of the Second World War, and you have one of the greatest examples ever of the slap-in-the-face, in-plain-sight, in-your-face public mockery employed by the Cryptocracy. You can just have a field day with the inside jokes, which I’m sure the designers of the monument did here as in Shanksville: the Key to the Kingdom/City of God, the Key of David (“he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth), the Key to the Shaft of the Abyss/Bottomless Pit (Revelation”)… Scorpions, huh? The constellation of Scorpio is one of the celestial markers for Galactic Center (it’s stinger points directly at it, along with the tip of Sagittarius’ arrow; “And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow…”), which, as we know today, is home to a supermassive black hole, or bottomless pit, you might say. The elliptical ring inside the reflecting pool represents the Earth’s elliptical orbit around the sun, and the two fountains at the north and south ends represent the Earth’s position at the winter and summer solstices, respectively. Also located at the ends of the pool are two triumphal arches, the northern arch inscribed with “Atlantic” and the southern, “Pacific.” The northern arch in fact represents the Golden Gate, the Gate of God – which is the Milky Way-ecliptic crossing at the Scorpio-Sagittarius nexus – and the southern arch the Silver Gate, the Gate of Man, the Milky Way-ecliptic crossing at the Gemini-Taurus nexus (this gate was represented by the horns of Isis and the associated constellation of Taurus). Many ancient religious traditions held that between incarnations on this planet, souls dwelled in the Milky Way.

This already sounds like some demonic Time Machine designed to alter the course of history itself, and we’re not even done examining its components and inner-workings yet. A 55.5-foot-tall, four-sided pyramidion, and 55.5 multiplied by four equals 222. I’m just gonna take a stab in the dark here and say that maybe the dimensions of the pyramidion encode 222 years, the final set of 222 years in the dying Great Age – not the 222-year span from 1776 to 1998, but from 1800 to 2022. (Recall that both the White House and the U.S. Capitol entered service in 1800; also note that in numerology, you drop the zero – ⋅ 2022222. ) Not only that, but the pyramidion encodes the most-precise year of Galactic Alignment, 1998. How do we know all this? The pyramidion is 666^(∘) tall, the capstone 62^(∘) and the aluminum apex 8.9.” (You don’t have to literally multiply the height of the pyramidion or its component parts by four – the proportions involved are what encode the relevant information. Don’t get all uptight on me.) From the base of the pyramidion to the base of the capstone is 595.1,” representing 198 years; and, from the base of the capstone to the tip of the apex is 70.9,” representing 24 years. (Feel free to run the numbers yourself: 595.1 is 89.35% of 666, and 70.9 is 10.65% ; multiply these percentages by 222 and round to the nearest whole number.) Subtracting 35 from 2021 takes us back to 1986. Anything space-related happen that year? Just the January mid-air explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger, whose maiden flight began on April 4, 1983 – 4/4. Also, in April, electrical engineer John R.

The third, as I’m sure you recognize, is the unfinished pyramid and Eye of Providence in the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse of the one dollar bill. The four-sided pyramidion consists of 13 levels, including the capstone, and one could view it as being projected in two dimensions from atop the monument onto the National Mall in front of it. This triangle, too, has 13 levels (formed by cross streets), including a “capstone,” at the tip of which sits the Capitol Dome/Womb of Isis. The dollar-bill pyramid has 13 levels, as well – but there are 13s all over the Great Seal, and most everybody knows that 13 is a major number in the occult (as well as the original number of U.S. colonies), so I’m not going to say much else about it. Each of these three triangles, then, encodes the 245-year countdown from 1776 to 2021. This means that the pyramidion encodes the 222 years from 1800 to 2022 and the 245 years beginning in 1776 – and it also means that the National Mall pyramid encodes 245 years twice: in the 5-7-7 pyramid and in the distance from the Washington Monument to the Capitol Dome. In any case, as we’ve noted, 245 is the product of 5x7² . Five times 245 is 1225, or 5²x7² , or 35² . December 25, 2021, or 12/25/21, will technically be the First Dawn Rising of the New Sun of the Next Great Age – although, as we know, our good friends don’t worship the sun, they worship Sirius, so they’re not gonna do anything to commemorate it (other than this numerological stuff we just looked at). Merry Christmas. Roosevelt’s mother lodge was located in his hometown of Oyster Bay, New York, and as President he visited numerous Masonic Lodges during his travels across the country and around the world. He also attended many Masonic ceremonies, including cornerstone layings and ground breakings.

We already know all too well that all of this is about “As above, so below” in a major way. This whole Grand Occasion is centered on the Great Cross, which I’ve pointed out repeatedly is represented in the Celestial City of Washington, D.C., by the White House. And, well, well, here’s Big Ole Teddy, due west of his former residence, striking the classic as-above-so-below pose (no, he’s not just gesticulating), blatantly reinforcing the central message. Let’s see, what do we have here? George Washington, Freemason. Thomas Jefferson, maybe a Freemason, buddies with lots of famous Freemasons. Teddy Roosevelt, Freemason. Across the gap there, all by himself, Abraham Lincoln, not a Freemason (and most likely assassinated by Freemasons, or the very-likely-Masonic-linked Knights of the Golden Circle, with investigations into the assassination almost assuredly being muddied up by high-level Freemasons. The sculptors in charge of the Mount Rushmore project were Gutzon and Lincoln Borglum, father and son, also Freemasons.) The question of whether or not Thomas Jefferson was a Mason has been argued for two hundred years. Most Masonic scholars take the position that he was not a Mason because there is no contemporary evidence that he ever belonged to a lodge of Freemasons. Most of the claims of his membership are based on his close associations with so many other Masons: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, James Monroe, Lewis Meriwether, William Clark, and Voltaire. However, there is some evidence that indicates he may have been a Mason and that he attended Masonic meetings. Dr. Joseph Guillotin reported that he attended meetings at the prestigious Lodge of Nine Muses in Paris, France – the same lodge attended by Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones. He marched in a Masonic procession with Widow’s Son Lodge No. 60 and Charlottesville Lodge No. 90 on October 6, 1817, and participated in laying the cornerstone for Central College (now known as the University of Virginia.) In 1801, twenty-five years prior to his death, a lodge was chartered in Surry Court House, Virginia – it was named Jefferson Lodge No. If he wasn’t a Mason, he clearly possessed all the prerequisites for membership, and his beliefs, his philosophies, and his great skill in architecture were certainly indicative of Masonic affiliation.

But he took the answer to that question to his grave – a big obelisk he designed himself. Odd, huh? Following Lincoln’s assassination, a number of conspiracy theories emerged claiming the involvement of a range of powerful interests, including the Freemasons and the Rothschilds, and the supposed motives – related to everything from the Civil War to monetary policy – were as varied as the alleged conspirators, much as with the JFK assassination. I noted that “John Wilkes Booth was a known member of the Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC), a pro-slavery secret society with some fairly grandiose strategic and political objectives that included annexing large portions of Mexico and South America,” and that “some researchers assert that Booth was also a 33rd degree Freemason.” Whether or not that is actually the case, you have to admit that, as visually impressive as the memorial may be, it’s a bit odd for the oversized likeness of Lincoln to be sitting in a structure that is not only clearly a temple, but one that bears remarkable similarities with the Temple of Zeus to boot. I’ve always been under the general impression that temples were built to honor gods and goddesses. f not a replica of the Temple of Zeus, or a mock fulfillment of Biblical I prophecy with Yahweh’s End-of-Days Judgment Throne, how about the House of Horus with 44-foot-tall exterior columns, each composed of 12 sections of 44 inches each – or the Seat of Satan, with his Throne Room constructed of 666s?1 The House of the Temple – which is the headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Southern Jurisdiction (officially, “Home of The Supreme Council, 33^(∘) , Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Southern Jurisdiction, Washington D.C., U.S.A.) )² − to the Jefferson Memorial (dedicated, obviously, to Thomas Jefferson, who, as we’ve discussed, may or may not have been a Freemason…I’m kinda thinkin’ that this is an argument in favor this notion); The House of the Temple to the Capitol Dome; and, the Pentagon to the White House.

H. White. The last two books of this series were largely the basis for the 1960 stage musical Camelot, the cast recording of which was a favorite of the Kennedys. As we’ve previously considered, JFK was also most likely “a top Masonic kill,” if not the top. Unfortunately, the JFK Eternal Flame is not 2.22 miles from the Lincoln Memorial, so we can’t add it to the list of buildings and monuments “smothered in 222s.” However, the distance between the two is 1.28 miles, the equivalent of 222 years, so it gets an honorable mention (using our standard formula, 1.28 miles x 5,280 feet/mile x 12 inches/foot = 81, 100.8 inches; inches ≡ days, divided by 365.24 equals 222 years). Another reason that this particular eternal flame is special is because it could be viewed as a claim of responsibility for the assassination itself (I know Jacqueline requested that it be a permanent feature of JFK’s grave – there’s a much deeper story here that’s well beyond the scope of this book). The Eternal Flame – and its cousin, the Torch of Liberty – is an oft-used symbol within Freemasonry, as well as a primary signature of the Illuminati, exoterically representing the inextinguishable divine spark within all humanity, and esoterically representing the flames in which the phoenix, symbolizing Lucifer, is consumed, later to be resurrected out of the ashes.

Completed in 1987, the sculpture is a full-sized, gold-leaf-covered replica of the Statue of Liberty’s torch.

(but who cares?). The George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association was established in 1910, meaning that it will be 111 years old in 2021 (The End of the You Know What), and construction started on the memorial in the same year that the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated, 1922. The height of the monument is 333 feet, and the thickness of its base is 3.33 feet. Keeping that last point in mind, and recalling that 1,111 is basically the product of 33.33 times itself, check this out: the distance from the southern portico of the White House to the Washington National Masonic Memorial is equivalent to 1,111 years (multiply 6.404 miles times 5280 feet/mile times 12 inches/foot yields the total number of inches; inches are equivalent to days, divide by 365.242 and this equals 1,111. Again, feel free to call the White House main line at 202-456-1111 if you want to confirm this). am fully aware that, over the decades, there have been many, many conspiracy-minded folk who, like myself, had too much time on their hands and found, or think they did, everything under the sun encoded in the streets of Washington, D.C. I get that. I also know that, at times, I can have an overactive imagination, and, as a very visually-oriented person, can see things that may or may not be real (I haven’t started hallucinating…yet…I don’t think). I’m not talking about an inverted pentagram here or there. I’m talking about a whole slew of symbols – occult, alchemical – overlapping, interlocking symbols. Very specific symbols with very specific meanings, that, when employed in certain combinations, under the correct circumstances, constitute magickal workings. And it doesn’t matter whether you believe in this type of thing or not – the super-elite that built D.C. and run this world do, at least on some level (even if they aren’t true believers or aren’t really concerned with anything but advancing their own interests and accruing more power). The results are what matter. I’m not talking about mere occult graffiti. I’m talking about symbolic programming of our environment and our consciousness.

W e’ve already talked about the major encodings, the Galactic-Alignmentand Great-Age-in-Stone stuff (although we’re not done on that subject, either). We’ve looked at the 10-Mile D.C. Square, House of the Sun, Dome of Isis, House of the Temple, Zero Milestone, Clock Cabinet Key, Jefferson Pier (and Monument), auspicious dates (and zip codes), as well as Teddy’s Island, Abraham’s Temple, George’s Lighthouse, and numerology out the wazoo. Some conspiracy theorists also claim that there are multiple hexagrams and one or more Templar (or Maltese) Crosses incorporated into the street layout of Washington, D.C. Of this, I will only say that certain possibilities exist, but determining their validity is not essential to our current discussion, and those things we must deal with are head-splitting enough. (Left) Three Freemasonic trestle boards. (Right) You’ve seen this before: it’s the Owl of Minerva-Moloch in the landscaping around the U.S. Capitol. It’s really there – if you can’t accept this, especially after everything we’ve covered in this book, I wouldn’t recommend reading the rest of this chapter. These are part of the established Freemasonic visual-language protocol utilized on the National Mall and in the street layout of Washington, D.C. – otherwise known as “not making something too damn obvious.” It does not mean that you can make up stuff willy-nilly all over the place (something you’re more than likely going to accuse me of here very shortly). The Great Pyramid of Giza… It would be difficult to underestimate the extent of the influence that Egyptian religion and mysticism had on the foundations of Freemasonry. Early Masonic Egyptophiles in some cases claimed to have drawn their practices and traditions from secret Egyptian texts, and in others asserted an unbroken lineage tracing all the way back to the Egyptian priesthoods. And there is no more important symbol, or one more varied in its application or more diffused throughout the entirety of Freemasonic tradition, than the triangle. As far as rationale and motivation goes for integrating this particular symbol into the street design of the nation’s capital, that’s a nobrainer. Still seem a little sketchy to you?

In this scheme, what is most intriguing, and perhaps convincing, is that the location of the Queen’s chamber is directly above the White House: the floor of the chamber is the northern boundary of Lafayette Square. As significantly, the Freemasonic House of the Temple sits at the northeast tip of the floor of the King’s Chamber. Further, in this scenario, the location of the Pentagon corresponds with the pyramid’s subterranean chamber, a feature some researchers hold to represent the Underworld, which would of course be a highly fitting metaphor for the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. (Ground was broken on the construction of the Pentagon on September 11, 1941, sixty years to the day before it was ostensibly struck by American Airlines 77.) Now, I couldn’t tell you for certain what all this shit means if someone had a gun to my head (but that won’t stop me from speculating at length, which I do in the next section). I imagine this monstrous conglomeration of symbols represents some sort of super-sized demonic sigil or talisman, or perhaps some nasty spell – or all of the above. Whether or not this is true – and if so, whether or not anyone believes it actually works – however, I have no idea. My instincts tell me that, ultimately, it was the result of very powerful people having quite a bit of fun. But, then again, these are the type of people that consider ritual murder fun. W e already know that the Washington Monument is The Great Year in Stone at the Center of Time, and encodes the Final 222, as well as working in conjunction with the Capitol Dome to encode the Final 245. It sits within an alchemical egg nested within a larger alchemical egg, and simultaneously within a vesica piscis – and two conjoined alchemical symbols for antimony. I suspect that all this egg and vagina symbolism serves to reinforce the primary message of the birth of a new sun and a new cycle of time, extending these themes into metaphysical territory involving the alchemical sun and other esoteric concepts that somebody smarter than me is going to have to figure out and explain to you.

I’m not going to re-hash all that the building and grounds represent in terms of Galactic Alignment, and I’m not going to tell you what I think I see in the landscape here in terms of alchemical symbolism. I’m simply going to lay it all out for you to look at. If you don’t see anything, it’s not going to hurt my feelings. But here’s what I was thinking: the White House and grounds, the veritable Window of Galactic Alignment at the Center of Time, covered top to bottom, and bottom to top, with alchemical symbols – and the White House itself, the House of the Rising Sun of the New Great Age, as the stem of the alchemical chalice, the Holy Grail. W hen I said at the beginning of the last chapter that “the uber-elite, mega-wealthy, black-magic-lovin’ maniacal geniuses who have methodically constructed The Most Powerful City on Earth over the past two centuries went absolutely bananas with encoded symbols in this extremely-important geographic location,” you now know that I wasn’t exaggerating in the least. KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL AXE, or Prince of Libanus. The 22d degree of the Ancient and Accepted rite. The legend of this degree informs us that it was instituted to record the memorable services rendered to Masonry by the mighty cedars of Lebanon, as the Sidonian architects cut down the cedars for the construction of Noah’s ark. Google image search for “hidden symbols in Washington, D.C.” will very likely produce the image above left, as well, which correctly shows that the city streets also form a pentagon around the pentagram. The yellow lines segments indicate non-existent sections of road. (Remember the rules from the last chapter – that’s allowed.) Interestingly, Rhode Island Avenue merges for approximately four miles in D.C. with U.S. Route 1, which subsequently continues northeast and eventually passes within less than five miles of Cedar Point, RI. (An item of interest here that I have not previously pointed out is that in the Upper-Half-of-D.C.-as-Great-Pyramid-of-Giza scheme, Rhode Island Avenue corresponds to the northern shaft of the King’s Chamber.1 In antiquity, this shaft pointed toward Alpha Draconis, a star in the constellation of Draco, the Dragon.)

(The Freemasonic Knight of Malta Degree is known variously as the Order of Malta, or the Order of Knights of Malta, or the Ancient and Masonic Order of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta.) Fine, another history lesson. Back to the matter at hand: the White House Inverted Pentagram (W.H.I.P.), whose southern tip sits on top of the White House, also points towards the super-triangle’s northeastern corner in Rhode Island? In the image below, the W.H.I.P. does look like some monstrous device, perhaps some Magick Machine used to bind the heavens and earth together, to project that which is above onto the landscape below, unifying the Macro and And that’s an interesting thought, actually, because there’s an easy trick, employing rudimentary geometry, that one can utilize to produce an inverted pentagram-pentagon at the heart of our Mega Masonic Apron – one that is of exactly the same proportions as that found in the D.C. landscape directly above the White House. 1. Draw a cross (solid red lines) centered on the tip of the internal triangle. 2. Divide the upper portion of the large triangle in half (dashed red line). 3. Divide the bottom half of that section in half (dotted red line). 4. Washington, D.C. is at the center of the cross, and, as we know, the D.C. 10-mile square is tilted 45 degrees. Draw a tilted square (shown in light blue) centered on the dotted red line that touches the north side of the large triangle. Construct a triangle (shown in blue) whose vertices are located: at the two intersections of the square and the dashed red line; and, at the square’s southern corner. The vertices of this triangle will serve as three of the five vertices of the inverted pentagon, and the base of the triangle will serve as the The length of the base of the pentagon will be the length of the two sides (indicated by dashed red lines) of the pentagon originating from its southern tip. The points where these two sides touch the larger triangle (in black) will be the locations of the last two vertices of the inverted pentagon.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242523_cleaned.txt:45:ae0fafbc334f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1048, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "We’re now off on an intellectual quest, going where mainstream economists fear to tread. We’ll wade into the torrential flow of payments for locations like those in Manhattan and into the crawling creek of payments for land in Death Valley. As Carl Sagan said, “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.” Another big number you should be able to drop into casual conversation is the worth of Earth in America. That’s the combined value of downtown locations, farmland, forests, oil and other minerals, airwaves, ecosystem services, etc. It’s how much we spend for the nature we use. I’d guess several trillions in the US annually. Let’s pause for a caveat, if I may, for the sake of clarity and brevity. Herein, the term “rent” is the original usage, payments for land, not for buildings, from when landlords were not building lords but lords of the land. Now days, “land” is not limited to the surface but also includes subsurface minerals and supra-surface electromagnetic frequencies, and not just solids like land but also liquids like water and gases like air (when it becomes scarce); in sum, whatever is natural and has economic value. n the late 1980s when Japan was booming, its real estate peaked. Then I if you could afford to buy the center of Tokyo – the grounds of the royal palace – you could afford to buy California four times. Of course, that ballistic value was speculative, well above what any rational person would or could pay. Actual location was much less but still a lot, given Japan’s population density. For some of us, our indifference is innocent enough. Rent is a number and we’re not especially fond of math, even suffer “math-o-phobia.” Nor of statistics. “Stories change people; statistics give them something to argue about,” said Bernie Siegel, an American writer last century. The rest of us, though, appreciate the challenge. That those who could calculate it, don’t, makes me even more curious. Or is ignorance bliss? Then we turn to a specialist. However, doing so gives officials the leeway to make claims that don’t hold up and yet become widely accepted. Thus we think of homebuyers who’re deeply in debt to banks as “owners,” not as “owers.” We joke about paying rent to banks and banks being the actual owners, so we know about the relationship. But the variant we automatically, unconsciously use is “owner.” Society’s critics routinely reveal all sorts of facts and fancies about corporations, dynastic families, and government cover-ups. Yet our watchdogs don’t bark at the oldest “unearned income” (unearned by an individual owner but earned by some entity)—rent for land. Their blind spot keeps them from sounding an alarm. Paying for the never-produced – versus actual products – is a phenomenon that’s invisible to most of us.

Paying for the never-produced – versus actual products – is a phenomenon that’s invisible to most of us. As Eskimos have several words for snow, English has many words for financial transactions – buy, sell, lease, rent, hire, pay, etc. But without a unique meaning for “rent,” we don’t see how it’s special. Long after the dust settles, a Johnny-come-lately may note how rising rent culminates in collapse. This observation, coming a decade late, does most people no good, leaving savers and investors, not to mention governments, to fend for themselves. That most bureaucrats and academics ignore the danger, might that be an act of negligence worth a watchdog’s bark? W hat enables thinkers like Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, andBen Franklin? (All these standouts were proto-geonomists.)As important as their powerful intellect is their lack of inhibition. These scouts and others follow their curiosity, wherever it may lead, into the knowledge hinterlands. Einstein, for example, said he rode a beam of light around the universe to see what would happen – quintessential thinking outside the box. Such unique difference-makers don’t just expand humanity’s body of knowledge. They also discover new ways for humans to view their world. In our current quest, instead of seeing reality as a place of scarcity and making a living as dog-eat-dog, finding a hefty total for the worth of Earth in America would paint a picture of bounty. Long ago in agrarian days, it was not just gadflies who sought fresh knowledge but monarchs, too. Their officials measured and recorded um ago in England. The Normans defeated the Anglo-Saxons, who were not so fresh from having just defeated the Danes. To know in detail what they’d won, the victorious administration commissioned statisticians of the day to tabulate the crown’s tax base. The final cadastre they named the Domesday Book in 1086 (“domes” being the root of “domestic” as is “dome” or “roof” whence we derive “a roof over one’s head”). It counted the output of the land and the assets on it.. No longer do governments tally land alone, leaving that value to F.I.R.E. (Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate). Some private specialists do tally. The Economist in “Land-shackled economies: The paradox of soil” (4 Apr 2015) showed that where economies perform bountifully, there land values soar (duh). However much one might prefer to remain thinking inside the box today, an eye-popping sum for the value of land, natural resources, EM spectrum, etc, enlarges that box.

We expect to get what we pay for yet don’t realize what else we all get. reward people for providing us with their labor and capital. But when we buy or lease land or an oil field, we don’t. On one hand, paying producers motivates them to produce more goods and services. On the other hand, paying owners for never-produced land motivates them to invest in lobbying for more favors. Good to know how the real world works (Ch 12). Owners and sellers don’t raise prices and rents so much as competing buyers and tenants bid up what they pay for land (often misnamed housing). As folks spend more on land, they have less to spend on the output of producers. As land grows more valuable, they have less to spend on clothes, clam chowder, a hair cut, or other things that reward the efforts of your neighbors. Over time, the imbalance becomes great enough that some of your neighbors declare bankruptcy. Eventually, a tipping point is reached and recession ensues. Economists who focus on rent, watching its value versus the other two classical returns – wages and “interest” (or “profit,” sort of) – let’s call “geonomists.” By tracking rent, they predict the booms and busts of the business cycle with impressive accuracy (Chapter 28). Which is nice to know, especially if you’re managing your own investment portfolio. n our modern era, it seems to many of us that land no longer matters. Who farms anymore, anyway? Rent being of no consequence is just common sense. However, as Bertrand Russell (another proto-geonomist) noted, common sense is often merely popular misunderstanding. This case is the opposite: unpopular understanding. Even critics who know things like the salary gap between CEOs and workers, and reformers who know the losses from smog dismiss land and rent. They do so without any pressure from the establishment, despite rent being key to their issues.

Conventional economists and mainstream statisticians trivialize and misconstrue natural rent. urthermore, knowing the success of their economy, a society might find a F socially beneficial use for this windfall now arriving in very few pockets. But why fantasize? Our critics say, despite evidence to the contrary, that no single demographic gets the lion’s share of such spending; it already goes to a majority. Economies are rewards systems – just like training pets. When we pay for some Earth, we do something different from when we pay for goods and services that somebody produced. Reward producers, they’re likely to produce more. Reward absentee owners, what do they do? Hire an extra shift at a land factory? That’s not happening but they may speculate even more, exploit more land and resources, and hire another lobbyist. Keeping the total unknown helps their cause (Ch 12). magine that we completely destroy the entire ecosystem—and survive. I We’d have to do what it did, like deliver rain. Stuff like that gets costly. Robert Costanza tallied up what we’d have to pay the planet to perform the services it now performs for free (like create oxygen). He estimated the value of ecosystem services at $166 trillion annually, a value that fluctuates annually due to human stresses. That’s for all Earth, not just America. Nor is that an exchange value; nature does not need to be paid to provide its services. Yet if environmentalists can receive Constanza’s financial figure, why not ours, too? There is a hurdle. Loving the land, environmentalists cringe when seeing others treat it as an object of speculation. Our seeking a figure for the rental value of nature seems suspiciously speculative. Yet emotion aside, a figure for how much we all spend now for land somewhat degraded must make some wonder how much land in better health would then be worth. It’s not that humans want to foul their nest. A fouled nest is just a byproduct of humans grasping for some of the worth of Earth. Because payments for land total so much, they attract lots of rational investors. A few of those investors and owners make money by putting nature to good use – selective logging, organic gardening, etc. Most make money by putting nature to bad use – clear-cutting, aquifer-draining, etc. Equally as damaging as misuse of land has been nonuse.

Farmland lost to asphalt and concrete might be better left as a source of food to feed urban dwellers. To infill cities, making them more compact, many environmental groups have endorsed the notion of public recovery of land values (Ch 39). In general, however, just like economists those “greens” might be curious to know how much would flow into public treasuries. The notion of infilling cities both attracts and repels urban advocates, town can’t help but bid up the rent. Like, the artistic element makes a warehouse district hip and cool. The caché attracts new residents with deeper pockets. Artists can’t afford higher rents so they resettle elsewhere. It’s like bees swarming from an old nest to a new, buildable site. (Was the trigger also speculator bees bidding up site values in the old hives?) Those who move out leave behind old friends, neighbors, nearby family, and coworkers, stretching – even severing – those ties. Those who stay put then deal with not only with higher housing expenses and property taxes but new neighbors and an altered character of their neighborhood, too. Yet citizens and cities both are both better off when communities are stable. • A pair of academics in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s New England Public Policy Center finger land rent: “inelastic land supply in some attractive locations, combined with the growing number of high-income families nationally, can partially explain the growing differences in house prices and incomes among cities.” • Politico reports the YIMBY Party, a coalition of renters, blocked a San Francisco ballot initiative to move zoning decisions beyond local control. Frustrated by high rents, they call for higher density housing and the federal government to get involved. Perhaps the US would tally land values for us all. The McKinsey Global Institute found that, by spending so much of their incomes on the rent or mortgage, households don’t spend enough on consumer goods. Besides not stimulating others to produce, add in shortage of affordable housing, inflating its price. Mal-housing costs the economy between $143 billion and $233 billion annually, not taking into account second-order costs to health, education and the environment.

Rational actors could take protective measures, re-arrange their portfolios. Meanwhile, you would not believe the estimates experts pass off now as somehow connected to reality. What gets into those guys, anyway? Your publicly funded Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) statisticians do allude to the value of land, by supplying a figure for rent for buildings. While in colloquial parlance rent refers to payments for temporary use of a building, in economics usage it means payment for impermanent use of land. You might expect specialists to use the technical definition, not the colloquial one. Everything else at official sites is in jargon. Advertising land rent yet using building rent is the old bait-and-switch. Rather than inform the curious, the minuscule figure trivializes the notion of rent. If our spending for land and resources is so tiny, why bother paying it any attention? Non-critical laypeople just go with the flow – if it’s official, assuredly it’s accurate, right? Their official figure has other problems, too. The bureaucrats don’t give but on responses from owners who pay less tax by reporting a lower figure. Furthermore, it’s only for persons. Yet however much is rent paid to nonpersons – to corporations, foundations, governments, etc – it can’t be much, since officially total corporate profit was only about 1/8th of total income. Anyway, playing with the cards we’re dealt, BEA rent in 2017 Q3 was $0.7 trillion. Total income was $16.7 trillion, so their rent was about 4% . As paltry as 4% is, some years they tell the public that rent is even paltrier. In 2000, it was more like 2% . Further, they didn’t put their stat on the bottom line but beneath it in an inconspicuous footnote. That’s their story and they’re sticking to it – or not. At another BEA table for the same year it’s smaller. The table is the National Income Product Account. Over the years various economists – Simon Kuznetz 1934, William Nordhaus and James Tobin 1972 (National Academy of Sciences 2005) – have said NIPA is incomplete and misleading yet it is the most important measure of economic activity for a nation. As Shakespeare said, “All’s fair in love and war,” and Timothy said, “the love of money is the root of all evil.” Evil might be a stretch, but certainly not “all is fair.” It’s disturbing.

We Yanks were raised on TV, males especially on the cowboy identity and the use of guns in defense of one’s spread. Our un-derstanding of commons gave way long ago, as did our awareness of commonwealth. Now it’s the individual who’s entitled, not community, so move along little dogie, don’t poke your nose into rent around here. “Oh look, there’s a dinosaur!” Another would say, “Where? I don’t see it.” If you declared, “There, see the biplane?” the frustrated doubter could say, “You’re trying to put me on.” If you kept at it: “Wow, can’t you see the angel?” the mad blind-spotted man might say, “Liar, there’s nothing there!” Our payments to landowners, being money for nothing, may be why economists discretely avert their eyes; what’s unearned becomes invisible. From their POV, why should others make a big deal about something that’s not important? If others do acknowledge rent’s role, and if that irritates mainstream economists, then those annoyed could damage the reputation of colleagues who can detect rent. Avoiding hard questions reinforces normalcy bias – How things are is how they should be. After decades of not researching property, absentee ownership, or rents congealing into fortunes, etc, now economists only write about non-prying topics like household debt, trade, derivatives, etc. Such safe phenomena don’t explain the inner workings of economies. By omitting the factor of land from their analyses and conclusions, economists tacitly assert that all spendings motivate equally. However, while our spending for things that other humans provide grows the pie, our expenditure for land or resources is how some hog the pie. Not distinguishing these two spending types, economists miss how economies work, why they sometimes don’t, and what to do it about. And by not seeing rent, of course most never measure it. As goes academia, so goes bureaucracy. Call the government’s info line. Nada. Why bother, since they receive no requests from academics? Hence the statistical blackout. Never counting society’s spending for locations keeps that stream of socially-generated value out of the spotlight. Out of sight, out of mind. Measuring rent makes it real, and once real, useful.

Yet despite their profiting, business lacks the authority of academia, who enjoy authority despite their being unable to predict. Go figure (Ch 28). Rent-trackers could lay bare the means by which wealth does not trickle down but pours upward. The growing wealth gap is due not so much to the elite behaving badly as it is to everyone behaving normally. We adhere to custom, including counterproductive ones – rights without duties, power sans responsibility. But what’s fun about blaming ourselves? • The press reports hi-tech minting billionaires, and previously oil fueling fortunes, but not prime sites enriching a handful of absentee owners and lenders. • Most people, never buying or selling downtown lots, have no idea how valuable downtown is. On 3-D maps, central city sites tower over others. • Academia dismisses land as a major factor in generating income. • And bureaucracy makes a morass of statistics re rent. However much this surplus, it’s due to the occupying populace. As creator of that value, society has a surplus. Society could see the world differently – not one of scarcity but one of plenty. Residents might contemplate what’s best to do with it. Would people redefine work and play? Feel more worthy of justice? See something so worthy, the Earth, as deserving of being kept healthy? Once before, fans of economics called for a new stat. Presently GDP measures quantity of growth, not quality of growth (Ch 38). E.g., treating cancer and curing cancer are indistinguishable. Dissatisfied, critics proposed new indicators of wellness and to inform policy. None weighted the current strongest stream within the GDP – rent. They were successful in winning some press but not change. Perhaps a tally for social surplus could satisfy both Old Guard GDP watchers and vanguard livability watchers You own the land, you own its rent, right? Or maybe not. Still, we grow up thinking of the worth of Earth in America as part of private property, despite society generating the value of location. Want to correct that widespread misunderstanding? Given human instinct, broaching land ownership is like touching the third rail of economics. Rather than call for an answer, propertarians, if they call for anything, it’s for silence on this issue. • professional society of appraisers, of assessors, and of bankers (since they’re mortgage lenders); • government agencies who collect the tax on property, both local and state, and apply the legislated exemptions to the property tax; • agencies commissioned with supplying lawmakers with statistics, both local", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242998_cleaned.txt:7:525927f693e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1056, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "widespread misunderstanding?

Seriously. The CIA website will tell you how bad the Gini quotient (concentration of ownership) is in the US. What? Spies don’t keep stats like that top secret? All the above alphabet soup – that’s a lot of bureaucratic firepower. To not be able to come up with the total of society’s spending for land and resources each year – or every day! – is pretty impressive. It must be the single biggest act of bureaucratic neglect since the US lost some weapons-grade nuclear material or lost $6–820 billion in cash during the Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq and just looked the other way. I guess not. Most economists and statisticians sit this one out. They measure wages, profits, unemployment, inflation, stock prices, bond yields, household budgets, the uncountable “consumer confidence” – a myriad of items awash in numbers. But not a total for spending that doesn’t reward anyone’s effort. W ho could supply us an answer? Assessors compile raw data. Govat number-crunching. For all three professions, determining society’s rent – spending for parcels, fields, and forests plus undersea oil and airwaves – should be a cakewalk. If nobody’s measuring the size of pure rent, we can at least measure the size of the problem of trying to calculate rent. Want to try to pry out an answer? Be sure to put the question – “How much do we spend for natural resources?” – to specialized folk in their technical jargon. Even then, communicating the notion of all rents for natural assets, it’s difficult. It reminds one of the old comedy routine of Who’s On First? by Abbot and Costello. Disciplined economists, content with current axioms, continue to tread water. Do we curious ones follow suit or raise the bar and nail down that number for the worth of Earth in America?

Such a stat would help show that people respond differently receiving payment for land and resources than they do receiving payment for goods and services. When hearing of requests to know the value of land and resources, most economists and statisticians seem to recoil in horror. They want to know how much we spend on the nature we use? Heaven forbid! Finding that out would capsize the conventional economics boat. That good dunking alone lures me onward. Consider the standard explanation of the Great Depression. The supposed cause was the crash of the Stock Market and the purported cure was the entry into World War II. Unmentioned is the huge role that the rollercoaster ride of land values played. Before the crash, speculators went belly-up in Florida, farmers went bankrupt in Oklahoma. Turn from cause to cure; before we went to war, the economy was already rebounding. Hence the crash-then-war story amounts to a widely accepted urban myth – and land is a blind spot. Economists who ignore privilege propose what does not work. Complicit politicians, who can’t deviate from the norm, adopt what does not work. Officials bark up the wrong tree while society marches along like the apocryphal lemmings off a cliff. All three prove Einstein (a proto- geonomist) correct. Repeating the same behavior while expecting different results is madness. Once a critical mass sees how cost of living depends on location rent, they may demand the statistic from responsible agencies. So far, however, a total of all rents that’s serviceable has not dropped into our laps. It’s a bit much to expect hirelings to go against the grain, even if public servants, paid with public funds, should serve the public at large. This could get interesting. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was paraphrased by an American, John Anster (1835), writing, “Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.” Such perfect inspiration for a Don Quixote. Whatever we find, we’ll eagerly report back. Expect to be inundated with data. Karl E. Case, writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research said, “While a great deal of attention has been paid to house prices in the United States, economists have devoted very little time to the study of land prices. In fact, there are virtually no generally available data on land prices in the United States.

Decades ago, Steve Cord (US; Ch 13), Ronald Banks (UK), Terry Dwyer (Australia) let their curiosity get the best of them, went out on a limb, and estimated a figure for their compatriots’ spending on Nature. Switching to formal language academics use, we typed in “total (or aggregate) value of land” and “total (or aggregate) land value” and “total (or aggregate) rental value of US land” and “total (or aggregate) price of land” and “total (or aggregate) land price” and “total (or aggregate) resource value” and “total (or aggregate) value of resources” and “total (or aggregate) value of natural resource wealth.” That swamped us in an outpouring of entries on older scholarly efforts. • At MSN Money, “What US Land is Really Worth: Land and Property Values in the U.S.” Turns out, rent is very much an urban affair. • At New York magazine, “Because We Wouldn’t Trade a Patch of Grass for $528, 783, 552, 000 Can one city park truly sell for so much and the whole country only 12x as much? Hmm. • At BizShifts-Trends, “Imagine the Ultimate Business Mega-Deal: Sell the Planet Earth– All Its Resources, Assets… But; What is the Earth Worth?” Quadrillions. And I thought Central Park cost a lot! The bias against treating rent scientifically has been internalized, like QWERTY on the keyboard has been institutionalized. Without being told, economists know what’s considered a legitimate area of research and what’s not, as do their students. Then comes the preponderance of courses and seminars and papers on everything but land. Few personality types can buck the trend. Most steer clear of the bigger picture figure. (Chs 6 & 12) utting-edge bloggers in recent years have published what they have discovered about how much we pay for “Earth in America.” Reading their articles in the popular press let us skirt the jargon. We may even find a shortcut to the value of land and resources. But it’d be accurate only if these reporters don’t just report what’s been written. They must also weigh the researcher’s methodology for thoroughness. “Why is it that people know so much about something so small (GDP) but so little about something so big (total assets)?

A balance sheet for the US economy at the end of 2008 shows (in billions) $104, 049 in total assets divided between $58, 639 in financial assets and $46, 301 in tangible assets. People own more than $46 trillion of real stuff like land, buildings, cars, and computers, not just securities. The Federal Reserve does not report complete balance sheets for other sectors (farms, financial sectors, federal government, state & local governments) or rest of world (foreign owners). I think that is a big mistake. The other sectors are actually bigger than the ones they do report. Adding in farms, financials, governments, and foreign owners brings the total financial asset figure up to $141, 512 billion at the start of the recession. As of June 2013 the market value of total assets held in the US rose to $234 trillion, not counting the value of land and natural resources held by governments (the Federal government owns more than 700 million acres), corporations, or foreign persons.” Consider John’s numbers. Of total assets, approaching half is tangible assets. Of tangible assets, well over half is real estate, likely over 80% ; land plus buildings are worth one heck of a lot more than cars, computers, clothes. And half of real estate is land. How much? Using John’s ratio and his $2345 , tangibles would be about $90t , real estate about $72t . If land is one half and buildings the other, land’s aggregate price is $36t – way up there, yet based on Fed figures. (In Ch 13 we reconcile that.) “Using the most recent uniformly available data on reserves and global market prices, 24/7 Wall St. calculated the total value of the proven reserves of 10 of the most valuable resources, by country. They include oil, natural gas, coal, timber, gold, silver, copper, uranium, iron ore, and phosphate. The U.S.’s total combined resource value [mostly fossil fuels and forests] is $45 trillion. One could make a good argument that as a filter for carbon dioxide emissions and as a producer of fresh water, the world’s timber lands are even more valuable untouched than they are when cut down and sold.” 4.

But why shoot for big government and not for sensible government, especially if one’s touting sensible tax policy? I suppose when students eschew tabulating and resort to projecting, they lapse into dreaming. Our question re the size of Earth’s worth in America sure does arouse the interest of those who favor government spending. Perhaps they’ll add their voices to a call for officials to tabulate an accurate statistic of society’s surplus. When a public agency does respond with reliable numbers, my work here will be done. In Riverside County California, a decrease of 10% in the distance to the nearest stand of oak trees resulted in an increase of $4 million in total home value and an increase of $16 million in total land value in the community.” –2018 Jan 5, “Big Trees Make Your Property Value Grow” at BrightView by Tree Care. Public amenities make locations more valuable. As such, land value is a social surplus. Based on the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds report, his total price was $14.488 trillion. However, watch out; Matt passed on the academic’s inflating the price of buildings which deflates the price of land. Maybe that’s why this total is way under Rutledge’s likely $36t . It also seems to measure only the surface, not resources which at $45 trillion are three times $14.5t . Tim points out 5% has been the average rent on land for long historical periods in a number of different places. So, 1/20th of Larson’s total yields $1.15 trillion rent per year from unimproved land – not much if you compare it to other income sources or to government spending. We’ll keep looking and find out if 5% still applies and how much more all kinds of land would bring in.

It feels good to find some sort of answers Iand rub intellectual elbows with those who went before. But I’m also wary, a bit. While grateful to those who tackled this quest, one must admit most articles were not overly analytical, nor very critical. Sure, one must respect authority, but an investigative journalist must do more than that – s/he must ask the hard questions, too. Nothing for it but to tackle the research papers, academic jargon and all. Make sure the value for all utilizations of land and resources gets counted, not just surface land for housing in particular or for buildings in general. You know, count oil, water, airwaves, et al. And whoever’s doing the counting, weigh their methodology for bias toward too little or too much rather than the Goldilocks means of just right. and is still a goldmine. In “The Rate of Return on Everything, 1870-2015,” economists Oscar Jorda, Katharina Knoll, Dmitry Kuvshinov, Moritz Schularick, and Alan Taylor compare stocks, bonds and housing over the past century and a half. They find the return on residential real estate [sitting on land] has been as high as or higher than the return on equity. As modern economies have grown and developed, owners of the ground on which we live have been steadily enriched. While our seeking to know the worth of Earth in America is an economic quest, it unavoidably runs up against political hurdles, more formidable than many imagine. One hundred of the wealtiest American families own as much land as New England. Their shell companies buy up vacant lots in pricey cities like New York. Those banking the payments we make for the nature we use likely intend to keep on doing so. The wealthy may worry that if public awareness of natural rents were to increase, then their private concentration of such rents might decrease. Upon learning of the immensity of this socially generated surplus, some people would reflect upon the facts that nobody made Earth, everybody needs land, and population density creates its value.

Forgo it? Or spend some of it to keep on getting most of it? Those who now receive the lion’s share of our spending for land – wealthy lenders and speculators – don’t lack for power and usually get what they want. Have they shaped data gathering? Do rentiers discourage research into land and rent? So other governments don’t take an Aspen turn? (Ch 40) As a who-done-it, the obfuscation of rent is an open-and-shut case. The motive is the possibility of losing rent; the means is rent itself. That the rich and powerful pay the piper and call the tune is par saging knowledge, it’s what elites do. Centuries ago, if an astronomer measured planetary orbits exactly, the ruling elite had kindling piled around a stake. While the auto da fe is not currently a threat, the Goliaths (veteran distorters of truth) still keep a lid on the Davids (wannabe discovers of truth). While the gentry usually enjoy smooth sailing, occasionally they encounter stormy waters. A century and half ago, the biggest fortunes were amassed by those able to win ownership of railroads – which actually raked in more money from the land they were given by Congress than from the freight and passengers they carried. Congress, in exchange for stock and seats on boards of directors, also granted near monopolistic ownership of timber for track ties to what became today’s Weyerhauser. The people did fight back with muckrakers and unions. Also, millions from all walks of life, inspired by Henry George during the final quarter of the 1800s, promoted a “Single Tax on locations.” In response, John D. Rockefeller gave $1, 000 to Republican candidate Teddy Roosevelt to defeat Henry George, and the powers-that-be robbed George of his victory in the mayoral race of New York.

When the popular movement to publicly recover socially-generated rents was a force to be reckoned with, the rentiers did reckon with it. They quashed the movement at every turn. Since power corrupts, the gentry corrupted not just politics but also economics. Of all the social studies, none is as relevant to the most powerful elements in society as is economics. During the formative stages of the discipline, the newly degreed economists ignored the role of rent and submerged nature’s land into humanity’s capital. They did so despite land being one of the three factors of production in classical economics, and still is in real-world economies. Those founders focused overwhelmingly on labor and capital, reinforcing the boss-versus-worker paradigm. With land out of the picture, rent got the boot next. There was no reason to count that which no longer counted. As land disappeared into capital, rent disappeared into the ether. – U of Michigan President Mark Schlissel said of billionaire real estate developer Stephen M. Ross, who pledged $328 million to the university “Demanding Donors to Colleges, Universities Hold Sway” in Free Press … 26% of funds donated to universities in 2014 went to endowments with restrictions (meaning income from these endowment gifts is designated by donors to a particular purpose), while 1.6% went to endowments without restrictions on the use of income. Fifty percent of gifts went to restricted current operations, and 7% were completely unrestricted; 13.5% of donations came in the form of or were for the purchase of property, buildings and equipment … Major donors – rentiers – dominate the conversation by funding only the research that agrees with them. They ignore the topics that don’t suit, or may even threaten, their interest. By determining what’s considered legitimate topics of research, they marginalize and even make controversial any formal study of certain fruitful subjects. For their role, universities are part of the local growth machine via their construction campaigns. They are often some of the biggest landlords in some of the poorest neighborhoods.

Rentiers could lash back at specialists if they go against prevailing winds and reveal the size of rent to the public. But the gentry don’t have to. Once a worldview gets institutionalized, it gets awfully hard to change. Normalcy bias sees to that. Outside a rare course-correction, more interference from above is not much needed. Donors don’t have to be heavy-handed. They can be quite discrete. They don’t censor. They don’t have to. In service of the elite for over a century, the economics discipline has not been self- correcting. Not many if any in the field object to the loss of land as a factor. Thus the lack of scientific rigor in economics is not sloppy or accidental; it’s political. It’s an inevitable result of subtracting land. The behavior of academics is natural enough. It’s the nature of domesticated animals, such as civilized humans, to obey, even lionize, those higher up in the hierarchy – and donors outrank economists by a long shot. Beyond that instinct, economists are subjected to another one: self-preservation. That gives academics and bureaucrats a more pressing reason not to rock the boat. By making it difficult for economists to take in the entire panorama of economies in action, the elite have made it difficult for anyone to poke their nose into society’s spending for the nature it uses. Lost to sight were not only rents, the sources of great fortunes; Didier Jacobs of the Center for Popular Economics calculated that, “when it comes to the very richest Americans (Forbes’ billionaires), 74% of their wealth is derived from rents.” (in “Are Billionaires Fat Cats Or Deserving Entrepreneurs?,” March 2, 2016). But also lost, to society’s detriment, is the driver behind the business cycle. By handicapping economists, rendering them unable to forecast booms and busts, rentiers deprived society of what could have been a useful science. n the perilous 1960s (perilous to the gentry), central banks (owned by I rich families of old money) lobbied the Nobel committee to give a prize to economists that the bankers offered to fund. Alfred himself left no money for economics, a field held in such low esteem back then by real scientists. Nobel also snubbed mathematics, some say because a woman he was enamored with was wooed away by a mathematician.

Rather than lobby the Nobel committee after Alfred’s death to be laureated, the mathematicians created their own prize, the Field Medallion. Yet few have heard of the Field Medal while the whole world knows about Nobel laurels. Bankers wanted that name’s prestige for their pet field and, notes The New Yorker’s economics reporter, John Cassidy, ponied up the prize money (Dec 2, 1996). The Nobel committee caved, mostly. Rather than bestow the faux prize in the annual awards ceremony in Nobel’s native Sweden, economists must do so in nearby Oslo. There, too, do-gooders for peace give out their prize using the family name, beginning well after Alfred died. Alfred’s descendants have asked the bankers funding the false prize to quit using their family name, notes Hazel Henderson at her site, Dec 30, 2004. So far, the bankers and the committee have turned a deaf ear. Note the double standard. When Levi’s complains about a fly-by-night clothier in, say, Vietnam, slapping the Levi’s label on subpar jeans, everyone agrees those jeans are counterfeit. But when central bankers slap the Nobel family name on their favorite economist du jour, nobody in the mainstream media utters a peep. According to Avner Offer and Gabriel Söderberg, authors of The Nobel Factor: The Prize in Economics, Social Democracy, and the Market Turn, the award serves elite interests. Global bankers have given their prize to an academic focused on society only once, to the Swede Gunnar Myrdal in 1974 (who, ironically, later turned against socialism). Every other year it went to economists more friendly to business interests. Many people assume that what the prize covers is science and what it leaves out is not – a huge bias in favor of the status quo and against geonomics. Yet neither faction of economists – neither those who are pro business nor those who are pro society – is very scientific, since neither distinguishes between spending that rewards lobbying for privilege and spending that rewards production of real goods and services. The award has continually reinforced the primacy of the present biased market in which the winning of rent is no different from profiting from production. Our overlooked land and our conspicuous money meet is at the bank. Banks make most of their money off mortgages. Consumer lending makes up the bulk of North American bank lending, and of this, residential mortgages make up by far the largest share.

According to professors Jordà (also with the Federal Reserve), Taylor, and Schularick (above) in their The Great Mortgaging (CEPR’s VOX, 12 Oct 2014), banking today consists primarily of channeling savings back to families to buy real estate. In advanced economies, banks resemble real estate funds: borrowing (short) from depositors and capital markets to invest (long) in assets linked to real estate. They continue. Since the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1913, nearly all of the increase in the size of the financial sectors in Western economies stems from a boom in mortgage lending to households. By contrast, financing the business sector has remained stable over the 20th century in relation to GDP. Household mortgage debt has risen faster than asset values, resulting in record-high leverage ratios. Mortgage credit has generated financial fragility of household balance sheets and the financial system itself. Contemporary business cycles are shaped by the dynamics of mortgage credit, with non-mortgage lending playing only a minor role. It’s become trite to note how, last decade, bankers dove into subprime lending. What’s not reported is how routine that is – they do something similar every cycle. And let’s not forget, they over-extend not just to starry-eyed home buyers but to the rich and powerful, too; real estate mogul turned anomalous President, “The Donald,” has been bankrupt six times. When bankers do this loosening of credit requirements, they may enrich themselves but at the expense of others; inflating land values makes crashes inevitable. Banks gain again whenever a government creates bonds. As the middleman selling them—e.g., Goldman Sachs— to other rich people and large institutions, brokers reap a tidy bit of income. The deeper governments go into enormous debt, the richer such brokers become. For them, nothing’s wrong with that picture. The federal government does not have to let broadcasters use the public airwaves for free, or timber companies log public forests and hard rock companies mine public land almost for free, or ground traffickers snap up the land values at the exits off the interstate highway system, or … You get the picture.

Rentiers have magnified their income by capturing not just rent but also interest on debt. The “oiligarchy” used oil rents to found banks: Rockefellers took over Chase, the Mellons launched Hannover’s which now is Citi. Warren Buffett bought the biggest block of stock in Bank of America and Wells Fargo. It’s not just for profit that the already rich go into banking but also to control the spigot of credit and the issuance of money. Since winning that power from Congress over a century ago, despite the Constitution making Congress responsible for that function, bankers have printed dollars and set interest rates, once pegging it at 18% (1981). Headed the other way, notes the Fed’s St Louis branch, has been the purchasing power of the dollar: it has shrunk while federal government debt has swollen. Inflation magnifies a bank’s income, and more so for a big bank than a small one even at the same rate of inflation (Ch 26). Banks, as do other big businesses, tend toward giantism. Big banks gobble up little ones so much that now five banks hold almost half of the assets held by all banks. With inflation, recession helps banks, too, whose assets have quadrupled since the most recent major downturn. Banks are the most common type of organization that controls the shares of the 299 biggest global corporations. Financial institutions – banks, financial companies, insurance companies, or mutual and pension funds or trusts – owned the majority (68.4%) of shares in these dominant corporations. Financiers control the corporations. And while it’s profitable, stable, and influential to control corporations, don’t lose sight of the fact that banks make most of their money from mortgages. Controlling both land and money, what more could you want? BlackRock, founded and opeStreeters, held or controlled 6.1% by the current generation of Wall of the assets of companies. At the end of 2017, they managed real estate, stocks, and other claims priced at over $6 trillion.

BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the biggest owners of the 4th biggest bank, CitiGroup. Vanguard, BlackRock, and other index funds own about 30% of REITs (real estate investment trusts). REITs are the tax-protected investor funds that own many of the nation’s offices, shopping centers, apartments, hotels, warehouses, data and storage centers, and of course their very valuable underlying locations; they’ve parked $1 trillion of their eleven trillion in REITs. Vanguard is by far the largest owner of REITs. After the housing bubble popped, millions of Americans lost their homes. Private-equity firms led by Blackstone quickly bought tens of thousands of homes at deep discounts, most of them out of foreclosure. Blackstone – which spun off BlackRock – became the largest single-family home landlord in the US, with 50,000 properties. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have nearly $11 trillion in assets under their management. These Big Three have become the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the US. They are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&P 500 firms, including Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, General Electric, and Coca- Cola. The Big Three exert the voting rights attached to these shares. They vote for management in about 90% of all votes at annual general meetings, while mostly voting against shareholders proposals (such as calls for independent board chairmen). Who owns The Big Three? All three own each other. Big chunks are also owned by big banks. Which real persons actually own them, is hard to find out, but it’s undoubtedly the 1% . The true ownership of shares is hidden by the use of “nominee” or “depository” organizations – such as the Depository Trust Corporation in the US. Even if their first fortune was not made in land, they soon invest in land. Zuckerman, Gates, et al own entire islands. Gates owns thousands of acres in Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania.

William Domhoff of UC Santa Cruz. One intractable and widespread blind spot is the popular belief that the state and the elite are separate entities. Only on the surface. And even there, the elite and state cell-divided only a few centuries ago when aristocracy and government split rather amicably and monarchs made space for parliaments then consisting of nobility. The slogan of “government of the people, by the people, for the people” is quite modern and true more in word than deed. Who gets laws passed? Who gets to violate them with impunity? Who gets bailed out? Who gets a foreign policy serving their interests? Who contributes the most to political campaigns, besides to foundations and universities? When subsidizing the Nobel committee or endowing an Ivy League university, how do the rich deliver that fat check? Face to face? Electronically? Via a minion in an office? In person at a fancy dinner party? What are the intimate details of how the real financial world works? The truly aristocratic rich do not have jobs; they have people for that. Wealthy donors, comprising less than .01 percent of the population, accounted for 40% of all political contributions in 2012. All those donors could fit in a baseball stadium.

F.I.R.E. is consistently the largest source of campaign funds for federal politicians cycle after cycle. One payoff was the bailout of trillions and trillions of dollars. For their contributions, the 200 corporations received 760 times as much subsidy – $4.4 trillion in federal business and support. That’s more than the $4.3 trillion the federal government paid the nation’s 50 million Social Security recipients over the same period. The $4.4 trillion total represents two-thirds of the $6.5 trillion that individual taxpayers paid into the federal treasury. • Agribusiness, which takes place on farmland: $121 ; • Weapons, which defends rentiers: $126 ; • Drug companies, whose customers often suffer from land abuse: $2.16 ; • Fossil fuels, a kind of “land”: $2.93 ; • Communications, utilizing utilities in land: $3.50 ; and the usual kingpin, • Finance, or mortgages, basically: $4.29 . To paraphrase Freud, what do the wealthy want? The usual. A hunky subsidy. A sweet-talking tax break. A party that fawns all over them. And without having to publicly, explicitly reveal their darkest desires – “stealth politics.” They want to be understood without having to be explicit. If we’re intimate, it goes without saying; you get it, right? The holders of public office determine public budgets, which funds has put the tabulating of rents in any official’s job description. So there is no official figure. The bureaucrats who collect statistics have neglected rent for as long as they have been collecting statistics – and likely will until economists realize the key role of land and request a measurement of rents from officialdom, regardless of whose feathers would be ruffled.

Some call those tax breaks, “tax subsidies.” Over half of them go to F.I.R.E., utilities, broadcast spectrum, and Big Oil ( Joe Romm for Think Progress, November 13, 2011). Agri-business gets huge actual subsidies plus is excused the cost of their toxic chemicals contaminating others downstream and downwind. Mining corporations, the same story. Loggers, same thing. Turning from legislatures to the executive branch, those agencies charged with enforcing the law do so selectively. Oil companies, for example, often fail to pay royalties without being punished, and pollute the environment egregiously without being fined. Locally, it’s meat packers. Industry in general gets a pass. Harvard professor David Landes and other economic historians say the key to great fortune is to socialize your private costs—like pollution— while you privatize everyone’s social gains—like the value of locations. Turning from the executive branch to the judicial, the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, John Jay, said, “Those who own the country ought to govern it.” The court has never wavered from that founding mission. Some of the most famous decisions by the Supreme Court favored land speculators. Justices ruled … • 1785, land contracts based on fraud are valid; • 1880s, railroads do not have to return unused land to Congress; • 1880s, railroad land is tax-exempt from any jurisdiction; • 1895, after progressives shifted taxes from tariffs to income – largely the rent for land held by the top 10% – tariffs may shrivel but taxes on rents may not stay; • 1900s, tabled cases filed by the first Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot, since they could have set off enough litigation to throw the entire Western U.S. into turmoil; • 1987, Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, sided with a developer to block an ocean view; • 1992, Nordlinger v. Hahn, upheld the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 13; and … • 1994, Dolan v.

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the cutting-edge Soviet economists invited some big name American economists to come over and tell them all about non-left, non-right, third-way economics, centered on a proper social role for the flow of rents. Fred Harrison wrote in Land & Liberty, that the U.S. State Department invited each American professor to stay home instead; all of them acquiesced. A small number of corporations (themselves owned in leveraging amounts by billionaires) own the biggest broadcast networks, both radio and TV, and get to use the airwaves – which are public property– for free. If ABC News and CNN ever agree to merge, they’d reduce the number of independently owned national television news outlets from five to four. A new network has little chance of getting off the ground without agreements from Comcast and AOL Time Warner to carry it. The two companies serve about half of all cable households. With a handful of companies deciding all programming, many points of view are underrepresented. And they also own the largest circulation newspapers. They own the media which frame the mainstream worldview. To paraphrase Lenny Bruce, “We, the media, don’t have to tell you; we’re a monopoly.” Just as a small number of banks dominate mortgages. And a small number of owners in general own most of all valuable assets. And the same 1% dominate government and academia, also they master the media that keep land and rent invisible to the naive eyes of the 99% . By controlling so much and keeping society in the dark, have wannabe masters of the universe (as some Wall Street speculators dubbed themselves) over-played their hand? Hardly. Despite needing to tighten their belts, the poor are not rioting. Despite needing to pop their pills, the middle class are not voting socialist. One wonders why the wealthy bother. New knowledge is not brain candy for everybody. The old worldview suits most people perfectly satisfactorily, thank you very much. No news is good news, and good news is too good to be true. The gentry could just enjoy the irony – many people who could be inspired by the size of the worth of Earth are not curious to know the statistic.

They know rent is a stream of spending that, as Bloomberg’s Noah Smith notes, drives a way-wide wedge between the comfy folks and those struggling day-to-day. Since favoritism plays the major role in amassing wealth, hard work and wise investment must play a minor role. Plus, the customary understanding of property allows profit from land to be a windfall for landlords, sellers, and lenders. Ergo, the very rich do not entirely earn their fortunes; they benefit from law and custom. More aware than the public of the source of concentrated wealth, the wealthy do still have to worry. What might spell disaster for rent retainers is simple innate human curiosity, made itchy by hard times. People are aware of recessions, sensitive to losing their jobs, and a bit grouchy after being foreclosed from their homes. Eventually a few must put two and two together. That could increase demand for measuring our spending on land, resources, and other assets never created by anyone. Despite academia being cowed, some economists must have felt curious. They became informed and published their findings, no matter how guarded their jargon may be. Let’s analyze these articles in the academic journals. Then we’ll peel off that layer and target the public agencies who should dish out answers for free and the private enterprises who could deliver stats that are precise. We‘ll uncover the rents that rentiers have covered up, and unearth (pardon the pun) the stories that they buried. Anything worth hiding by the few must also be worth knowing by the many, eh? In a way, it stands to reason; central authorities do issue the symbol for wealth – money – out of thin air. However, they can only do so on their computer in the Federal Reserve, and that computer and that building must stand on land somewhere. Further, that location must be in the center of the nexus of power. In the US, that’s split between New York and Washington, the locations of the Fed’s HQ and its most powerful branch. If central bankers were not physically close to Wall Street and to Congress, they could not wield the power they do, which, as always, depends on relationships: being on a first-name basis with your fellow movers-and-shakers.

At any rate, given their attitude toward land as an antiquated, peripheral factor, many specialists today do not realize that taking an educated guess about the worth of Earth in America has an intellectual lineage. In years gone by, even mainstream academics did make an effort to calculate the total value of land and resources. Now, however, the institutional memory is lacking, hence this quest to measure all rents comes from more adventurous current researchers (a few such economists do exist). All statisticians and economists in the field know how indifferent, even critical, most of academia and government are toward measuring the torrential flow of rents. For specialists to feel hesitant about hopping on a bandy bandwagon is a normal human reaction. Yet a few stalwarts did: and we salute them. Even though those authors do address themselves to the rents paid for natural assets, they cannot do so in any other way than their usual academic fashion. Since specialists don’t cater to us or offer any de-coder rings, we must meet them on their turf – the language of the specialists. So be it – the price of admission. Questions about the worth of Earth in America are a lot to ask of busy specialists who tend to have already said all they can say on the topic. Usually they don’t have to deal with laypeople but only with other pinpoint-focused specialists fluent in the jargon. When a lay person seeks something as esoteric as the money society spends for the nature it uses, a specialist comes in mighty handy. While doing the research, it’s a relief to see a help link at a voluminous website, or see a help desk in a specialized library. It’s encouraging when bureaucrats point visitors to where the data concerning land values are kept in the buildings, in the stacks, and in the Internet. So their help is greatly appreciated. JS (author): As an activist, Dr. Cord was the long-time leader of the Henry George Foundation. He single-handedly persuaded dozens of towns in Pennsylvania to recover some of the socially-generated value of their locations. BTW, Pennsylvania is the only state whose constitution allows a legal class of cities to levy different rates on land and buildings. In a few Rust Belt states, a city, not a county, can do so but only with permission from the state legislature. In many other states, such as the growing states on the West Coast, speculators influenced legislators to amend their state constitutions to specifically prohibit splitting the property tax. They made the public recovery of socially-generated site rent, which stimulates infill, illegal. Without giving the figures, Fred figures land rents could fulfill 60% of all public budgets.

In 2006, the Census Bureau says that those budgets totaled $4207 trillion – $2.6554t federal and $1.7653t state and local expenditures; 60% comes to $2.6524t (almost identical to federal spending then). That amount would suffice if governments were to quit making income transfer payments. The beneficial results of treating land rent as the tax base, rather than taxing salaries, sales, and structures, include: “higher incomes, reducing the demand for government welfare programs. Decentralization, privatization, and the elimination of wasteful government programs would further reduce the amount needed to fund government.” JS: But why GDP, which is annual, while land sales are infrequent and long-lasting?Is it just convenience? If using price, then comparing to other physical assets—maybe precious metals or museum pieces—might be more telling. Also, in 2006 home sites peaked, so while $11.6 t might look like a lot it might really be a little. According to the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds Report, the price of owner-occupied housing for the entire US in 2006 (the peak year) was $22.8 trillion – more than the capitalized value of the NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq exchanges combined. The price of just the land underneath owned by households and nonprofit organizations was $6.9 trillion. The value of land owned by all four sectors – household and nonprofit, non-corporate, non-financial corporate, and financial corporate – at year-end 2007 was $12.4 trillion. The method that Davis and the Fed use is to take the price of real estate ($23t) , subtract the replacement cost of structures ($16t) , to get the nigh $7t . Their methodology shows that land in the corporate sector [supposedly] lost almost all of its value between 1989 and 1995. JS: While comparing price to price is the better comparison, Davis recalculated the value of residential land for 2006 from $11.6t (in #3 above) to $6.9t . For a “correction,” that is enormous. They both can’t be right and perhaps neither is. Further, how can land, especially downtown land where corporations have skyscrapers and locations are the most pricey, lose nearly all its value? One must wonder about their methodology. According to the Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds (FOF) accounts, the total price of land held by households, nonprofit organizations, and businesses other than farms and financial corporations at the end of 2009:Q3 – close to the bottom of the recent land-price cycle – was roughly $4.5 trillion.

JS: His 2006 peak of $19.6 trillion exceeds Davis’s figure of $11.6t #3 above), yet Homburg includes land used for more purposes than just housing while Davis looks only at home sites. Homburg’s bottom of $8.4t exceeds the FOF nadir of $4.5t ( #5 above) by nearly twice as much, yet the FOF figure includes more than home sites, so it’s hard to see why the discrepancy. Further, Homberg’s plunge extinguished well over half of his peak figure, while one half is usually the outlier amount of loss, claim many observers. So his figures bear watching. JS: Both estimates are less than the $11.6t for home sites in 2006, the peak year (#3), yet by 2016 housing had recovered its previous peak price. Once again, conventional statisticians lag behind the market. They’re back to assigning to location only a third of total housing ⁺ site price while in 2006 they gave sites half of total property price. Almost all the above articles focused on the value of land below homes. Finally in 2015 an official statistician broadened his target to include the values of land for all uses and other natural resources besides the surface. He also included all land whether it was owned by private parties or public agencies. The contiguous (lower 48) United States plus the District of Columbia (1.89 billion acres), in 2009 prices could cost at least $23 trillion. The financial sector, or banking, which owned the least amount of actual land, had greatest value per acre, by far: 249 acres priced at $7.3+ million per acre. None of the above top nine articles crossed the finish line and tallied the holy grail of the worth of Earth in America. Either they left out public land or left out land used for something other than houses, or based their guesses on combinations of land plus buildings or used out-dated stats. If the rentier powers-that-be tried to discourage inquirers, they succeeded. Yet whatever official estimates lacked in accuracy they made up in respectability. Almost everyone who finds cause to cite the value of land cites the official figure, warts and all, as gospel, without bothering to question the method used.

So let us get our own hands dirty and question that method – by taking a look at rich cities. The low figure for land—and high for buildings—follows from the method the mainstream uses to separate the value of land and building in a combined price for a property. The value that conventional economists give the value of buildings of any age is their replacement cost. The value they give to land or location is what’s leftover. A couple of mainstream economists offered a correction. Nicolai V. Kuminoff and Jaren C. Pope write, “First, the replacement cost approach may overstate the value of land during a boom-bust cycle. Second, the bias may not be neutral. Our results suggest it would be largest in the highest-amenity neighborhoods.” (This is from “The Value of Residential Land and Structures during the Great Housing Boom and Bust.”) Pope and Kuminoff also “suggest that moving from a property tax to a land tax may actually help to stabilize revenue streams for some municipalities.” Shades of Steve Cord (see above)! Does even such faint praise unnerve rentiers so that they frown on research into the value of land or, if one must, at least distort it? Consider again the conventional ratio of land to building. Specialists have a hard time accepting the fact that in the wealthy ski resort at Aspen CO a vacant lot fetches $10 million easy. A million dollar house in San Francisco is actually an $800, 000 site with a bungalow on it. Same goes for $10 million dollar apartments in New York; those are $8 million sites. Developers pay $1, 000 per square foot and upwards in any world-class city like New York, London, or Tokyo. That square foot is for the floor, drawing attention to the building, but includes the site, the part overlooked. Remove the building and maybe it’s easier to see. The Federal Reserve in its Flow of Funds (FOF) accounts uses a method to determine the value of land that yields negative values, which cannot be right. Instead of switching to a more accurate method, in 1995 the Fed stopped publishing its estimate of actual land value, yet continued to publish a total for land and buildings combined. Rather than try to derive a value for land from that stat, the Albouy team turned to records of the sales of land alone. They tallied 68,756 land sales covering 76,581 square miles of urban land, or city regions, that public statisticians named “Metropolitan Statistical Areas” (MSA). In 2000, all MSAs accounted for 80% of the US population and probably at least as much of the US land value.

In 2000, all MSAs accounted for 80% of the US population and probably at least as much of the US land value. High ratios favoring land give conventional brains vertigo. Mainstream statisticians in 2006 (the peak year) tabulated all real estate at $43.3 trillion, structures at a whopping $26.3t , and land at only $16.9t . Albouy and his team could deal with the vertigo. Using land sales, they calculated its aggregate price was $30.40 , nearly 80% higher. Also, their estimates proved more stable than those of the FOF. At (or near) the bottom of the last cycle in 2009, the land price total fell, according to the FOF, down to only $5.8t yet, according to Albouy et al, down to only $14.4t . The peak-to-trough decline in the FOF was 66% – well beyond the normal outlier of 50% – while in the Albouy study it was 40% – well within the 50% normal outlier. How do they reconcile the huge difference between official results and their own? First, as cities get bigger, their sites grow in value, more so than do their buildings. Officials overlook this phenomenon and subtract an exaggerated value for buildings. Second, the FOF, while including land outside metro areas, left out public land. The Albouy team, while excluding land outside metro areas, included land for civic buildings, parks, and roads. Assuming that the public owns urban land worth 40% of Albouy’s total, then private parties own land priced at only $18.2t of the total, which is much closer to the FOF $16.9t . The other nine academics slanted land value downward. The authors bent over backward to minimize the object of their study (the value of land). The economics discipline, literally, constrained its mildly wayward members. It was as if the authors served not objective science but some interested party. To my ears, the tone of the articles did not have a ring of scientific caution in the face of the unknown but of political caution in the face of known biases – those of the ruling rentiers. Backtracking is the name of the game. We began with popular articles by journalists who hyped a total for the worth of Earth in America (in normal English), citing the findings of a researcher (Ch 11). Peeling the onion, next we analyzed the academic articles (in professional jargon), whose authors based their findings on official stats (Ch 13).

Backtracking is the name of the game. We began with popular articles by journalists who hyped a total for the worth of Earth in America (in normal English), citing the findings of a researcher (Ch 11). Peeling the onion, next we analyzed the academic articles (in professional jargon), whose authors based their findings on official stats (Ch 13). Now we’ll pay a visit to the stocked ponds where specialists go fishing. Our authors used the academic centers and government agencies that record prices for real estate, sometimes even for land alone, or sometimes even for natural resources. Scouring those official sites and more, we draw closer to figuring out the total value of assets never produced by anyone’s labor or capital. Knowing the total’s change through time, we would know the business cycle better. And we realize a flow of dough that’s a surplus, socially generated. My list of entities to query about natural assets has about 80 names on it. Given that phone numbers change and the person who answers typically transfers the caller to someone who may know the answer or transfer you yet again, that’d total well over 100 calls. I decided to rely on the new custom of email. Some think tanks that think about ground rent are around Boston (America’s college central): the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Lincoln Institute. Others are in the nation’s capital, Washington DC – the Urban Land Institute, the Brookings Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Center for Economic and Policy Research. While a goodly number of the 80 replied, none gave a satisfactory answer. Whether public or private, there is no service, institute, office, department, bureau, board, or administration that’s assessing all land and resources or tracking all rents. Out of all of this nation’s enormous bureaucratic and academic infrastructure, nobody is curious enough to record how much society spends for the nature it uses. 1. Housing and Urban Development: Whereas the other federal agencies focus on houses (where the middle class live), HUD focuses on apartment buildings (where, mostly, the poor live). HUD pays many of those poor a voucher good for housing. In 2012 (HUD was six years behind – imagine a bureaucracy doing that), HUD counted 2 million properties, yet the National Apartment Association says there were 2.3 million back then (if you can’t correct them, still cite them). HUD found rental receipts to average over $100k per building and to total $200b for all buildings for the year. JS: HUD numbers come from apartment owners filling in a survey, and the less value they admit to the less tax they’re required to pay, so the actual rental value could be higher. HUD gives the building rent, an annual figure, and we’re seeking an annual figure, albeit for land not buildings.

HUD gives the building rent, an annual figure, and we’re seeking an annual figure, albeit for land not buildings. The average selling price of a complex was a bit over $1 million. With receipts averaging a tenth of that, we derive a ratio of price to rent ratio of 10 to 1. So the value of the land underneath apartment buildings would be at least $100b in 2012. The owners’ property tax was under 1.5% or $30 . The land half of that, or $1.56 , gets added to site rent, too. JS: Use Case’s figure for 1975 land value – $291, 740, 000, 000 (Ch 13) – and multiply it by the FHFA figure. Then land value in 2017 comes to $1,684,740,152,000. A tad more than a trillion and a half is quite small compared to most estimates that went before (Ch 13). Which figure is likely off? Case’s land value or the FHFA’s multiplier? In 1975, the stock market was $137, 281, 000, 000 ; if Case’s number were any bigger, it would be outlandishly bigger. That leaves the FHFA multiplier as the culprit, which makes sense. In some of the towns where I’ve lived the last few decades, housing does not cost merely five or six times as much but 10 or 20 times as much. 6. Bureau of Economic Analysis: The BEA gives four relevant measures: personal spending, rental income, GDP, and fixed assets. At the end of 2017, for personal spending, the BEA listed housing but combined it with utilities, coming to $0.120, 442t . They gave rental income $0.757.4 trillion. At the end of 2016, in their GDP by industry they gave real estate $3, 454.6t ; agriculture, $0.4281t ; and mining $0.3856t ; totaling $4.2683 trillion. They gave fixed assets $20, 785.7 trillion. • Plus, in the BEA’s personal expenditures, now it’s not just land complicated by buildings but also by utilities. These bureaucracies are heading in the wrong direction, away from a stat for land alone. The BEA’s figure for housing in personal spending is way below the 30% or 40% or 50% of income that most studies cite and differs wildly from that of Labor (coming up below). These four BLS categories in 2016 totaled $31, 862 . So, consumer units spent 42% of their income on these categories. If half of the value of those categories is rent, then they indirectly spend 21% on land, locations, and resources. As a whole, the 129,549,000 units spent $4, 127, 490, 238 on those four rent-stuffed categories.

As a whole, the 129,549,000 units spent $4, 127, 490, 238 on those four rent-stuffed categories. If half that figure is for land and natural resources, it still seems low. Of course, all this leaves out spending by nonprofits, business, and government. 8. Census Bureau: For 2016, they gave an aggregate price for allhousing units: $21,935,096,166,400. For “real estate andrental and leasing” they tabulated a revenue of $487, 655, 249, 000 . For the total revenue that states raised via taxing property – land and buildings – they tabulated $19, 031, 950, 000; 1 4 states were left blank and some of those states were big and rich, like New York. JS: Their $22 trillion for housing was close to the BEA’s $21t for fixed assets, but you’d think that all assets would be greater than just one asset. Whatever, the Bureau’s return – under a half trillion = 2% – is abysmal. Obviously, their return leaves out “imputed rent” or the value of owner occupancy. As for the property tax, the revenue collected by states was even less than 1% assessed value (price)—pretty paltry considering society generates the value. The above are the eight federal agencies that deal with residential costs. There is a ninth organization that is not exactly a part of the government nor is it apart from the government. It’s in a limbo land – like NBER, which receives federal money and supplies government with many of its bureaucrats, both low- and high- level. I refer to the self-christened … In Flows, they created a category they call “Households and nonprofit organizations; gross fixed investment, residential equipment and structures (includes farm houses)” and another “Nonprofit organizations; gross fixed investment, nonresidential structures, equipment, and intellectual property products.” Let’s assume their structures sit on land whose value is folded in. The Fed priced structures at $632, 900, 000, 000 and land at $148, 700, 000, 000. Together that’s $781, 600, 000, 000 . JS: Their $28 trillion is more credible, greater than all previous official figures. It’d be higher with the real estate of corporations and governments, yet lower with land alone (excluding improvements). Their Flow from that asset (about $800 billion) is also only 2% . The mighty Fed leaves a lot unanswered.

They yield conflicting lump sums and make no effort to explain why they vary from their brethren; did they all use rubber rulers? Other fields have agreed on definitions – like the different kinds of clouds in meteorology, so why can’t our public statistician and economist servants be as considerate? I could not find the answer at the National Association of Realtors, the long-standing go-to group. Nor at CoStar, which a lot of researchers use, but they charge for services. However, I did get a stat at the site of the new kid on the block. Their website – out of all the university, government, and realtor sites – was by far the prettiest and easiest to use. Zillow used to show the separate values of home and land in the Tax Assessment area in the record for each property. They no longer do. Now the only value they show is the combined value of location and improvement. Land value is no longer available from Zillow because even they cannot get it from any agency, from local assessors to federal Census Bureau. If land is half of Zillow’s near on $32t , then residential sites might approach $16t If you substitute that $16t for the figure Larson used for home sites in 2009, then Larson’s $23t (Ch 13) total goes up to nearly $30t for all land. That’s in the ballpark with Albouy’s figure of over $30 trillion of a decade ago for metro land (Ch 13). Thus Zillow does lend credence to Albouy’s total and methodology. Most researchers above leave out lots of land. Humans don’t just put houses on land. We erect other buildings, too – offices for commerce and factories for industry. And we don’t just build, we also pave, yet most tabulators overlook that land used for streets and parking. And some land we don’t build anything on but take something out, as we do from farmland, forests, mines, oil wells, etc. And once again, we won’t leave out a patch because it’s owned by a nonprofit or business or public agency. To tally a true total, the category “Land” would have to include both urban and rural, solid and fluid, and private and public. We found some figures for those categories, however accurate or complete they may be. We’ll play with the cards we’re dealt, work them into our calculations, and get closer to that grand total for the worth of Earth in America.

Furthermore, land is not just acreage owned by individuals or households or families but also by nonprofits and for-profit businesses and corporations, plus governments. Most of the lands not yet counted are owned by the public, via our governments. You’d think we the people might like to know the value of our natural holdings. And that our public servants would be able to tell us. 1. The USDA’s Economic Research Service, unlike the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, stepped up. They projected farm real estate to be $2.6 trillion for 2020. Minus buildings, etc, worth at most 20% , crop land and pasturage together come to over $2 trill. BTW1, owners rent out 40% of farmland; non-owners worked over half of cropland and over a quarter of pastureland (reminiscent of feudalism). BTW2, over the last 20 years, we’ve lost 31 million acres of farmland – about the size of Iowa – three acres every minute (human diners, take note). JS: It’s not just farmland whose value is judged by annual output, i.e., the harvest. Commercial sites, too, are determined by how much money merchants can make at the location each year. As they do for metro regions, some sources – like NASS above – give a figure for land and buildings, not land alone. For those estimates, researcher Merijn Knibbe suggests “applying a 20% haircut to distract the value of farm buildings” (in real-world economics review, issue no. 69) to calculate the value of farmland alone. So 80% of NASS’s 2016 figure is $12, 45, 384, 800, 000 trillion. For 2017 using ERS’s figures, $3k times 911 came to $2.80588 trillion. That’s a pretty big one-year jump but the bigger number is more recent and used smaller aggregates which tend to be more accurate. Adding it to metro land (Albouy, Ch 13) puts the total for both city and country at $33 trillion. Moving from the big gorilla of private land to the little monkey of public land, value-wise. Acreage-wise, the US owns about 1/3 of America and from it raises revenue. Much public land is “unimproved.” Without much in the way of improvements, not subtracting their near-zero value does little to alter the combined total. In the boonies, almost all the value is from the land and resources. Life becomes easy, one hopes … 3.

The Treasury has a Bureau of the Fiscal Service which produces a Financial Report of the United States Government. On Balance Sheets under Assets it has “Property, plant and equipment, net.” For 2017, they put it at $1, 034.5 billion ⋅ p 10 or 17). Later they separate out land at $13.4 billon (p83) , exactly same amount they gave to the cost (?) of land. “Property” probably includes “Federal Oil and Gas Resources” and “Coal,” but if not they found only $47 billion for the former (p 197) and $9 billion for the latter $\\left( \\mathsf { p } \\thinspace 1 9 9 \\right)$ . JS: In their scheme, land is a tiny fraction of property. One reason is they impute a huge cost to land. Of course, there is no cost to create land, so it must be what they’re doing to land. Further, their $47b is well below the BLM’s $74b . Both are too minuscule to be realistic. Neither would add much to the growing total, already in the trillions. 6. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes whenever a part of the government behaves irresponsibly, such as officials keeping lousy records. “About 34 percent of the federal government’s reported total assets as of September 30, 2016, and approximately 18 percent of the federal government’s reported net cost for fiscal year 2016 relate to significant federal entities that, as of the date of GAO’s audit report, were unable to issue audited financial statements…” JS: That’d be about two and quarter trillion dollars. Of course, country folk spend some of their income on home sites, too. And it’s not just housing costs – we pay for land whenever we pay for anything. When you pay for food, part of that payment goes for farmland. For gasoline, part of that payment goes to whoever owns the ground with oil under it.… And so on. There are more public lands whose location values may not have been included. The list includes: port districts, landing slots at airports, ship berths in harbors, boat slips in marinas, highway, bridge, and tunnel tolls, etc. While it’s a pretty extensive list, in the bigger scheme of things the values are not so huge that if they were overlooked, it’d not undercut the grand total that much.

One hopes the given values of land and resources above would include access to water (where applicable), but they may not. If statisticians left water out, here are some figures from elsewhere: 10. The US Geologic Survey figures Americans in 2010 withdrew about 355,000 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) from surface lakes, rivers, etc, and from the underground water table. BTW, the biggest user of water – bigger by far than second place agri-business, bigger than farms, factories, mines, and homes put together – is power plants generating electricity and thereby needing cooling (which may be another good reason to go solar). Yet the USGS did not give a price. The University of North Carolina’s Environmental Finance Center did: one cent per gallon. JS: Multiplying by 365 days in a year, water prices out at $472,948,750,000. Given that both the population and economy has grown since 2010, and that one penny is the absolute rock-bottom figure, it’s easy to see a realistic value of $0.5 trillion for water in 2018. Paid annually, that’s not a price so much as a rent. Yet, that’s for water out of the tap, while we want its long-term value, in the ground. For its value in situ, let’s estimate a quarter-trillion bucks. I am shocked… not really by the predictable greed and cheating of the unrestrained very rich. But, also, by the complicity of our public servants with a feeble enforcement system, compounded by their bad bookkeeping. They keep silent about the elite’s breaches of contract, and silence is tacit consent. Then they declare that their total – missing so many data points (facts) – is the true, accurate total of the value of public land. To put it politely, doing so is at least sloppy and misleading, at worst seriously dishonest. A ll of the above except the US Geologic Survey get their info from asses-Asors and appraisers who get their figures from actual sales (which is where the UNC EFC, above, get theirs for water). Since tabulating land value is their business, perhaps we can find a total at a professional organization. 11.The International Association of Assessing Officers has a great tag line: “Valuing the World.” So if anybody should know the worth of earth, it must be them, right?

Plus, they’re the ones everybody else gets their numbers from. But they’ve not made available a solid number for the price tag of America’s land if it were for sale. Or the rental value if it were for leasing. JS: His well over a half trillion dollars is much less than farmland in #2 above, likely due to the passage of time – 17 years. Over almost the last two decades, the acreage of rural land has decreased – due to sprawl, mainly – yet that very sprawl has driven up the value of the remaining rural acreage, especially close to metro regions. So, the value of non-farmed rural land would be significant but still unknown. 15.The Heartland Institute’s Richard Ebeling wrote “There is No Social Security Santa Claus” (2015 Dec 22). He noted the Federal Government owns mineral reserves of copper, nickel, gold, zinc, platinum, lead, and silver, plus 257 million acres of grazing land and 250 million acres of timberland. He puts the price tag for all those natural federal assets at $5.5 trillion. He said he used many official sources which, however, he did not name. JS: Interestingly, $5.5t is also the new record for all central banks’ bonds that no longer pay interest but charge it against bondholders, to put the amount in context. So if Ebeling’s $5.5t is accurate (and he did do thorough research) that’s a hunk of change. It’s overwhelmingly immense yet overlooked and set aside by academics, bureaucrats, and journalists. It would push the $33 trillion above (Albouy’s plus farms, mainly) to $38.5t . The uncounted non-federal, non-agricultural rural land could push the total to $40 trillion. The passage of time would by now (2019) have pushed it to the the mid 40s, nearly double Larson’s $23t (Ch 13) , and at 10% yielding a rent total around $4.4 trillion. Recall the GAO’s gentle critique of official figures #6 above). We’re not the only ones to notice flaws in public bookkeeping. We’ll see what others have said about that.

Lars Peter Hansen, who bankers’ prize), said, ^(′′)I believe that the recent financial crisis exposed gaps in our knowledge.” His colleagues’ response was, itself, a gap. Mainstream economists seem nonchalant about their own colleagues critiquing them. Recall Karl E. Case, one half of the go-to team for housing prices – the Case-Shiller Report – noted a specific gap in academic knowledge, the one with reference to land rent totals (Ch 10), never mind the specialists tabulating a good number for the worth of Earth in America. Both Albouy writing about metro land and Larson about all land (Ch 13) make the usual plea for collegial follow-up. Yet their monumental works go uncited by their peers. (We mention their figures to insiders every chance we get.) Everywhere you look, land, land everywhere, but not a plot to count. Yet land’s rent is big and powerful – everything you’d want in an economic phenomenon; it is many trillions and it drives the business cycle. But economists don’t measure it and don’t theorize with it. That’s two strikes – one away from being an out. While we find economists asleep at the wheel – most of them overlook land, one of the only three factors in production – actual members of the discipline find many more faults. According to those economists, their cohorts get nearly everything wrong, from basic assumptions to technical writing. Yet ironically, even the critics miss land, the discipline’s most blinding blind spot, just as the “complacents” do. Are the two phenomena – absent land and crippled economics – linked? Is the reason why economics frustrates even economists the fact that they lost land as a factor? So that now they founder and devote themselves to distractions? And code their claims in impenetrable jargon? Thereby facilitating the adoption of mistakes as gospel? nsider critics of jargon can occupy lofty positions – at least for a while.

He erred in focusing on precision in communications and not on the feelings of economists. The more than 600 DEC employees pushed back and the Bank president sided with them. Now Romer no longer oversees the DEC. Nor, if you’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop, does he work there at all, after speaking frankly in an interview. The clipping of Romer’s wings reminds economists that even prominent ones – they awarded Romer the so-called “Nobel” Prize – cannot rock the boat without consequences. If they can’t even raise the bar for communication, how could they consider doing something as fundamental as researching a basic factor in production, i.e., land? It seems they can’t. Bad as it is, what World Bank economists crank out is as good as it gets. Members of the discipline rank the World Bank as tops in development research. In terms of the number of times its output is cited, they’re first, ahead of the London School of Economics, Brown University, and Harvard University. The Guardian’s John Lanchester lists his favorite (least favorite?) jargon. One is “quantitative easing.” It’s a euphemism to cover up the fact that the biggest central banks create brand new money from nothing and hand it over to lesser banks and friends until they can pay it back. One main way the recipients avoid bankruptcy and amass funds to repay the gift is to buy government debt and ship the interest to the central banks. Able to count on banks to always buy their bonds, governments slide (or rush) deeper and deeper into debt.

Our being uninitiated non-specialists on the DIY kick, we strain the eyes peering at tables and reports and articles. We wade through all the numbers, jargon, and faulty reasoning, sparing others this initiation rite. Sure, jargon can be used to convey thoughts to other specialists. Yet writing for peers means not writing for we lay readers. Given the caution with which economists must tread, being obtuse is a way of flying beneath the public’s radar, and thus the elites’. Writing in jargon is better suited to cover-thy-butt than to revealing important truths. Jargon serves as a code to exclude non-specialists. It creates insiders and outsiders, becoming a badge of belonging. Every generation and every discipline does it. Humans are wired that way. And cliques are fine for teens, but for those supposedly adding to society’s storehouse of knowledge? Most academics are paid – directly or indirectly – from members of society paying taxes. If taxpaying lay people cannot understand their tax-paid academics, how’s that fair? More irony, besides insiders objecting to their discipline’s jargon, is that pointedly ignoring land could be the root cause of corrupt economics. Without land rent to include in their calculus, economists cannot calculate logically – i.e., distinguish between spending for the produced and the non-produced. Without much of importance to say, they still say much, and say it guardedly. Academic economists can’t shake themselves free of the habit of expressing themselves in ways to avoid impolitic mistakes. Not only do they speak mainly to each other, but they have few outlets through which to speak to each other in. If they can’t get published in one of less than a half dozen journals, then they cannot advance. And the journals get to control the debate and the topics debated. Well, if denied by their superiors, maybe they should be talking to we of the hoi polloi anyway. Figuring out how to make sense to the intelligent uninitiated could do economists good. Life in the cloister insulates one from having to deal with challenges affecting a majority of humankind. To reach the goal of sensible specialized writing, “we also need to connect our academics to the real world rather than trying to free them from it,” suggests Jack Stilgoe, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at University College London.

Fortunately for real scientists, they can slug it out in the laboratory or in the field. Unfortunately for economists, they can’t. Unable to run experiments, they need to write clearly in order to think clearly. Writing non-clearly allows and reinforces muddled thinking, which helps explain why economics in particular and social studies in general are such a mess. So, universities make scholars study statistics and other things that their phones can do for them. What if, instead, they made students study writing? How to compose a clear sentence, and how to write intriguingly. If academics wrote more clearly, would they think more clearly? I bet they would. You should’ve seen my thinking before I started writing. tation, it’s one which cannot conduct experiments. Real sciences pinpoint quantities and take measurements quite seriously (maybe because they can). Economists, on the other hand, cite “statistics” that are far from foolproof (next chapter). Hence economists can believe and espouse anything – and do. Stepping up to the plate, the US Surgeon General required academic publishers to paste onto articles about economics a caveat, like on a pack of cigarettes: “Warning: Statistics contain high levels of political influence. Trusting them can be hazardous to your financial health.” And if he didn’t, he should. Some insiders find official figures worse than useless. Most professional economists don’t mind the absence of a total for the worth of Earth in America but do object to the presence of tallies that are inaccurate and irrelevant and thus distracting. Official fuzzy numbers are a perfect match for the standard risk-adverse jargon (Ch 16). Experts cite them, and most people base crucial decisions on them. Especially when the figures come couched in officialese, people tend to accept them as gospel. But are they? Are they tainted by politics? Is a competing unofficial number better? Decider, beware. One should take these figures with a grain of salt. “…the focus on the two headline indicators … created great incentives to governments to compile figures on deficit and debt that look good, instead of them being good from an economic substance POV. There is a clear tendency to continuously look for ‘grey areas’ to manipulate the relevant national accounts data… These practices have substantially increased in ‘popularity’ since the start of the financial crisis during which significant pressures on government finance emerged, amongst others by the direct and indirect effects of the economic downturn and the bailouts of banks.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242998_cleaned.txt:42:9e4b49ab0448", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1091, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "incentives to governments to compile figures on deficit and debt that look good, instead of them being good from an economic substance POV.

Thereby GIGO (Garbage in, Garbage out) strikes again. According to Otis Dudley Duncan (1921-2004) in Notes on Social Measurement: Historical and Critical, those academics suffer from statisticism. “Coupled with downright incompetence in statistics, we often find the syndrome that I have come to call statisticism: the notion that computing is synonymous with doing research, the naïve faith that statistics is a complete or sufficient basis for scientific methodology, the superstition that statistical formulas exist for evaluating such things as the relative merits of different substantive theories or the ‘importance’ of the causes of a ‘dependent variable’; and the delusion that decomposing the co-variations of some arbitrary and haphazardly assembled collection of variables can somehow justify not only a ‘causal model’ but also, praise a mark, a ‘measurement model’. There would be no point in deploring such caricatures of the scientific enterprise if there were a clearly identifiable sector of social science research wherein such fallacies were clearly recognized and [kept] emphatically out of bounds.” W hile our public agencies do not tell us how much we’re all spend-ing for the land and nature we use in total, let’s not feel singled out. They slight other curious groups, too, who’d like to know statistics like a qualitative GDP, the true inflation rate, real unemployment rate, total assets of governments, actual debts of governments, etc. The more important the indicator, the more massaging it gets. • Ecological economists object to GDP since it measures quantity of growth, not quality of growth. E.g., clear-cutting trees from a hillside, causing erosion that degrades a stream, contributes to GDP no differently than does selective logging that leaves a forest available to hunters and hikers. Nevertheless, the media report faster growth – no matter what kind – as a social good. And whoever is in office gladly takes credit for it. • Leftists economists point out that the definition of unemployment was changed to consider the under-employed as employed and to not consider those no longer futilely seeking a job as unemployed. A smaller figure for unemployment, in the eyes of many, makes those in office look good. The real unemployment figure is actually double, or triple, or over quintuple the Bureau of Labor’s figure. • Populist economists remind anyone listening that the official definition", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242998_cleaned.txt:43:6932504d40b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1092, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "office gladly takes credit for it. • Leftists economists point out that the definition of unemployment was changed to consider the under-employed as employed and to not consider those no longer futilely seeking a job as unemployed.

The real unemployment figure is actually double, or triple, or over quintuple the Bureau of Labor’s figure. • Populist economists remind anyone listening that the official definition of inflation has been changed at least 20 times in 30 years. One of those official changes deleted the very thing we’re looking for, which is the value of locations. Using the older definition, inflation would be at least 7% , probably more like 10% . These critics come from within the discipline, so they themselves don’t lack credibility. Their alternative stats do. What they gain in accuracy, they lose in credibility. The alternatives rely on raw data that come from officialdom. And even if unofficial calculators can find a way around that conundrum, their measure is still not official. Hence, nobody pays it much attention. The major players making policy and huge investments ignore the homemade figures and stick with convention. While I feel for all those critics cited above being ignored by most of their colleagues, their suffering is soothing. Their voices shouting in the statistical wilderness give us room to talk, to question the official dismissal of rents. As we search for any sign of rents, the relevant stats we’ve found do not inspire gobs of confidence. It feels better knowing other critics have gone before. Most professional economists shrug off absent data, even misleading “data.” Too many academics are indifferent. They have an attitude of “oh, that’s good enough” when clearly the figures are not. It’s like they and their statistician brethren have jobs with no curiosity allowed. Caution and conformity should be the job requirements listed right under the job title for a Public Information Officer. For the academics and bureaucrats compiling them, the jumble of tables is what’s important. Whether they have any accuracy or utility or insight does not seem to matter. Doing a job that pays well and gets paid attention from the business media and academics authoring articles (since officials have a monopoly on both data and status, where else can the curious turn?), that’s what matters, not the datum for Earth’s worth. In particular, bureaucracies … count things of minor import – e.g., consumer confidence; over-count some indicators – e.g., GDP;under-count other indicators – e.g., unemployment or inflation; and bundle what should be kept apart – e.g., housing with utilities.

Their false frames yield misunderstandings and distorted world views. Statisticians go deep but not broad. Going deep, economic statisticians measure an enormous quantity of minutiae, like “advance US retail and food services sales.” Failing to go broad, they leave out customs like trust which make civilized trade possible. Alan Greenspan, who was the most powerful person in economics while he reigned at the Federal Reserve, confessed to being surprised to learn that trust matters. That was his comment upon observing Russian criminals take over the conversion of so-called communism into capitalism. Conversely, economists go broad but not deep. Despite economies being nothing if not systems of incentives, economists fail to unbundle the two kinds of spending. Spending for human-made goods and services versus for natural assets are as different as a beard and a barbarian. The economists’s catch-all category for spending is reminiscent of speed-reader Woody Allen’s review of Tolstoy’s War and Peace (or War and the World in the author’s native language): “It was about some Russians.” It was about some purchases. Official stats are not only way off the mark – real GDP is lower, real inflation higher – but their measurements shed little light on what their measurements shed little light on what economies are up to. And what we need to do in response. Not knowing how much society spends to never reward labor and and capital (i.e., our spending for land) means that economists cannot make good statistical arguments. That guarantees the futility of economics. Trying to calculate aggregates of items is just the opposite of measuring the size of particles. Physicists have their angstroms down to the trillionth. Chemists measure parts per billion. Economists pretend that their stats are of equivalent stature and call their statistics “data.” No way. The commonly applied phrase “massaged data” is only half right; there is no data on the menu – only approximations. An official figure resembles an actual value about as much as a stick figure resembles a living body. First of all, a total for the value of American land and resources does not exist. Not one public site, from local to federal has a separate category for the total value of the nature we use. Researchers must ferret out surrogates. Then their numbers that do exist typically minimize the value of a part of the natural world humans use. For some reason. That officials don’t tally a figure for payments for land, a basic factor, begs an explanation. They tally figures for payments for the other two factors in production, labor and capital.

Aggregate wages were $6.3 trillion in 2015. A stat from which to derive interests says that all US businesses grossed about $20 trillion in 2012. Yet officials give no approximate stat for the base factor, land. That the average Jane and Joe overlook land, hidden beneath buildings, is understandable. Us non-experts may refer to the cost of housing, assuming the human-made part to be what’s valuable and the nature-made part not so much. But the “expert”? Despite their training – or because of it – even specialists make the same mistake. Palumbo (Federal Reserve Board) in their “The Price of Residential Land in Large U.S. Cities” (Ch 13). In 2004, two years before the peak in “home” (actually, home plus site) prices, the prices of homes along the coasts were not much greater than those for the other three US regions. Thus the increase in homes (+site) prices reflected the value of land, i.e., location. Usually, when bureaucrats and academics put forth a number, it’s lower than what’s logical, typically lower than how much private business calculates. In the business press, one can read the occasional article reminding the lay public that location absorbs purchasing power. Hence land is vastly more valuable than buildings. One article found this obvious yet invisible fact in the 10 most populous US cities. Davis and Palumbo aren’t the only game researchers. The Lincoln Institute calculates land value based on home sales and updates it frequently. Eschewing houses, Albouy, turned up $30 trillion for metro land, while leaving out the trillions for non-metro turf. Larson took a stab at the grand total and found $23 trillion, way below Albouy’s partial total (Ch 13). W hile grateful for these exceptions, the rule is another matter. Not only do statisticians lack a stat for rent, they also christen their charts for the profit from location with jargony labels and sometimes without any labels at all. To get to the meaning of their numbers within, one must decipher their packaging. Contact an authoritative voice: the Census Bureau (public) or the Federal Reserve (private). One of the surprises among many is that authorities did not understand my question: How much do we spend for the nature we use each year, from land to oil, including water, etc?

Driving away us riffraff, is that the official rationale behind the present figures that are incompressible and irrelevant? But if we don’t persist, who will? Inside the official box, land is obscured, subsumed under capital; i. e., buildings. Bureaucrats suggest, If you want to see something relevant, look at what stats we do trot out! • come based on assessments or appraisals of lump-sum sales, not ongoing leases; • may combine commercial and residential and leave out agricultural; • may include sylvan, mineral, spectral – or not; • tally together private and public – or not; • miss elements such as roadways, port districts, airport landings slots, the value of marina slips, etc; and • are not centralized or standardized but are scattered across many agencies, both public and private, and in language that is not only obtuse but inconsistent from one agency to another; they don’t use the same meanings for the same terms. Most tabulators don’t give a value for land but for land and buildings combined. Those few who sought the value of land alone tried to separate it from the price of location plus house. Yet the worth of Earth is far greater than the value of just the land beneath a single-family home. Downtown – land beneath stores and offices – is where site values spike. And the method they chose to ferret out land under-counted it. onventional economists claim the value of buildings far out-Cweighs the value of the location. Trying to justify their assertion, they don’t subtract the value of the house as is from the combined total of the property. Instead, they subtract the building’s replacement value, pegging the value of that house as if it were brand new. Buildings age, need repairs; they depreciate (they’re not known as “money pits” for nothing). Regions, on the other hand, become popular and more densely settled. When new people move in – like highpaid techies into San Francisco, or sold-out Californians into Oregon – locations appreciate. The pushed-up property values are pure land value, nothing to do with aging buildings. Bureaucrats make available a morass of surrogate numbers woefully distorted. It’s like economists go out of their way to issue under-sized values for land or locations. If they’re not going to do it right, why do it at all? Imagine that the local pub’s barkeep served residents shots so shaved down. I’ll bet then the public would be up in arms.

Academics, bureaucrats, and dynastics (to coin a term) studiously ignore our spending that never rewards labor or capital (since neither factor created land). They subsume rent payments in expenditures for goods and services that humans do provide, then release their figures weekly, busily turning lemonade into lemons. Filling the forum for knowledge with noise makes it a great place to hide the rent signal. Out of sight … hose officials who collect the figures have neglected rent for as long T as they have been collecting figures. Similarly, economists have mislaid land for so long, that today’s cloistered practitioners fail to see the non-human factor’s relevance. If land does not count with economists, why would statisticians count its value? By now, this official trivializing of rents has bred indifference among conventional economists. For them, society’s spending for one of the three factors in production – land – does not matter. The vast majority of economists simply do not care how much it (locations, natural resources, EM spectrum, et al) is worth. After a while, they can quit even pretending to tabulate land value. Rather than calculate accurately, the Fed quit calculating rent at all, notes the OECD. Professionals who should know better don’t see the difference between assets created by humans and those that are not. Established economists don’t see how our spending for human-smade assets stimulates more output while our spending for natural assets does not. Hence they miss what drives the business cycle. Even politicians are innocent. They’re obeying the will of voters, and the most consistent bloc of voters are homeowners. Most of them are equal part land speculator. Dealing with land value puts one under political pressure. Most everyone yields (“Politics and Federal Statistics” by Janet L. Norwood in Statistics and Public Policy, 28 Sep 2016). Assessors, when they exaggerate the value of the improvement, they do the property owner a favor, since buildings depreciate and the owner can deduct that amount from their income tax liability. When they understate the value of the location, they do the land speculator a favor, since a lower number hides this socially-generated value. For conventional professionals, a realistic large number is controversial, while a sketchy small number for rent is safe. However, less really is less.

Specifically, society loses the measure of natural surplus, a reliable indicator of economic swings. Downplaying the role of land and payments for land, those economists and statisticians stay the course. Or, if you can stand the pun, they stay the curse. They are not doing science but merely maintaining the status quo. Whether intending to or not, without received orders being made explicit, both number-crunchers and academics have become guardians of the rentiers, the few happy recipients of the vast flows of rents. Since localities do not tax locations apart from improvements, they don’t care about the value of land. Ever the practical, county assessment offices quit assessing nature-made locations separately from human-made improvements. In Oregon, some assessor offices toss into the circular file their assessments of land. And being officials, the way they do things is what becomes Standard Operating Procedure. Some assessor offices do much better. British Columbia, whose office was set up by geonomists Mason Gaffney, emeritus UC-Riverside, and his protege Ted Gwartney, former assessor for several jurisdictions and Chief Appraiser for Bank of America, is so well-known for precise assessments that professionals come from all over the world to be trained or hone their skills in rainy BC. Americans could reach for the higher Canadian standard. As for any difficulty of separating the values of land and buildings, the difficult is not the impossible. And how hard is it, really (outside of political pressure)? Actually, not that hard. Redevelopers who buy property to tear down the extant building and erect a new one, they separate the value of the location from the value of the improvement upon it all the time. For them, the task is simple. With computers, the county assessor’s office could easily update all records of all parcels in an area every time one of them sells or leases. The totals would never lag and be available to all comers. The federal agencies, who now get their numbers from the local ones but don’t do much with them, could truly serve the public.

Yet the Fed does not include the value of land and non-produced assets held by financial corporations and government. Moreover, owners do not directly report the value of their land. This gap between concept and measurement biases figures downward. There are tons of numbers to use. Each year in the US, there are hundreds of thousands of transactions for land, resources, electromagnetic spectrum, etc. There are sales, leases, sublets, auctions, plus taxes levied on those natural assets, not to mention interest paid on the land portion of mortgages. Most likely, number-crunchers won’t budge until economists ask for more relevant stats. Perhaps it requires a controversy – an innocent proclaiming that the emperor wears no clothes – to motivate the discipline, to spur reform. It’s a duty job, so somebody has to do it, typically a gadfly, a curious investigator, certainly not an official obfuscater. No hard feelings, but may economists remember, science has always been a back and forth between old and new theories, and between researcher and skeptical public. Once they’re measuring the flow of rent, seeing the size and fluctuations of that spending stream, and understanding how economies operate, economists could do more than guesstimate; they could predict. Finally forecasting accurately – and stating dates people could plan by – they’d become real scientists. Thereby, our critiquing of their nowadays numbers is a service to society. It makes me feel a little sorry for economists and statisticians who once may have had professional pride, their having to toe such a partial, biased line. Do they feel embarrassed to be dishing out such distortions rather than the best data? To be the butt of jokes? (e.g., somebody who rescues statistics that can’t lie for themselves). Deep inside, I bet economists probably want to become scientists, or they would not suffer from physics envy. A healthy number of them would welcome reform, eh? Do too many people want to know the worth of Earth in Americaand secrets must be kept? Or do not enough people want to knowand paltry demand elicits no response? Whichever, those with the resources to measure natural value in America, but don’t, have made it exceedingly difficult for those who don’t know that value, but want to find it out.

And … • They, Federal Reserve, outsources to private corporations for the statistics that they themselves used to collect, collate, and package in quasi-intelligible form (Ch 26). If you ask, the Fed introduces you to the private firm that they use. If you want those values for the surplus the economy generates from natural inputs, you have to pay. For the middle man Fed, it’s pennies. But for your average quester on a shoe-string budget, it’s more than a researcher can typically afford. Turn from public assessors to private appraisers. Bankers accept property as collateral. When they foreclose, they resell the land plus building. Eventually their borrowers resell or refinance. As sound business people, bankers might like to anticipate their prospects – how much profit they can expect in the future from the grand total of all land. It’s the bureaucratic version of W.C. Fields’, “Go away kid, you bother me.” Even longer ago, having to dish out such futility at his job is what supposedly drove bureaucrat and absurdist writer Franz Kafka, author of Metamorphosis, mad. If their goal was to utterly derail any inquiry into the value of land and resources, officials have come close. Bill Larson, an employee of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, of-fered the world a total for the worth of Earth in America. Now thatothers can see his figure for the value of land and resources, that rent becomes real – and useful.

When including land owned by state and local governments, did Bill include roadways? Most overlook streets, but not all. TeleCommUnity in 2002 figured the annual value of the nation’s rights-of-way by themselves to range between $305 billion and $366 billion, and the price of the land beneath streets – most streets are in high-value cities – to be $7.1 trillion1 – the difference between his $23 t and Albouy’s $30t . Larson called his figure a draft estimate, said his study attempted to provide baseline methods upon which further researchers can draw. He asked fellow economists and statisticians for refinement, yet his brethren ignored him. We won’t. If public agencies won’t do the work, we’ll have to figure it out ourselves. It’d be great to have an army of eager grad students pitch in. Professors have that luxury, so why don’t they … never mind. If you want something done right… What we lack in experience, we’ll make up for in unbiased adherence to impartial logic. A real scientist goes out on a limb and says the world is round, space is flexible, time relative, and things too small for you to see make you get sick and die, no matter the fuss it may kick up. Political prudence and compromise is nowhere near doing real science. Unlike those whose careers are on the line, we can follow reason wherever it may lead. So we won’t low- or high-ball. We’ll merely tally as precisely as possible. And live with the results. • Land: downtowns, home sites, farms, fields, forests, underground ores, oil deposits, etc, • Water rights and waterways, • Airwaves for all telecommunications, and • And if you’re not to leave anything out, incidental locations like marina berths, airport landing-lots, etc, • The above, whether owned privately or publicly, and • payments of principle, interest, insurance, taxes, etc on these assets. That should cover it. The one who generated a total for all land, Larson, admitted his was owned by state and local governments, did he include roadways? By focusing only on the surface, could he encompass oil, ores, and airwaves? Did Larson incorporate the _(F)^(ω)F^(′′) and “I” of F.I.R.E. (payments for loans and insurance)?

Yet it clobbered all other academic estimates for total property – natural land plus man-made buildings. The greatest amount for land any one of them could find was $12 trillion (Ch 13). How can the discrepancy be so great? • Fourth and fifth, Larson unavoidably left out lots of things and used figures for 2009, close to the bottom of land prices in the recent recession. Albouy, too, left out lots – all rural land – and also based his total on prices from 2009. What Albouy did differently was avoid aggregate assessments of land plus buildings (Ch 13). Instead, Albouy’s team used individual sales. Not sales of property but only sales of land. From those prices, they extrapolated a total for all land. Just as “replacement cost” and other tricks make official small figures unrealistic, actual land sales make Albouy’s big figure reliably realistic, despite being so much greater. According to Zillow, since 2009, the increase to 2018 has been 12% . So Albouy’s $30 trillion is likely in 2018 to be $33.4 tr. Coincidentally, the increase in federal land since 2015 – the year of Ebeling’s $5.5 tr (Ch 15) – has likewise been 12% . That raises federal holdings to $6.6 tr – more than the $6.5 tr tax dollars gone missing. Add up these two updates of Albouy and Ebeling, plus the $3 tr for farmland – the USDA figure was up-to-date (Ch 15) – plus the fraction for water. Now we’re at $43.5 trillion. Forty-three and a half trillion for all land and natural resources. After spending so much time down the rabbit hole of officialdom, I feel like I’m performing alchemy, cobbling together such a biggie when they arrive at such littles. Besting the best official guesstimate by so much does give one pause. While an ongoing rental value is a fact, a lump sum payment for all land is a fiction. If all land were for sale, it could never sell for the aggregate sale price. Supply would drown demand. Auctioneers could never fetch anywhere near those aggrandized aggregates. With so much to choose from, buyers could be picky and patient. They could negotiate down to an amount well below lump price, closer to annual value. If society leased out all locations at once – a la Hong Kong, Canberra, US port districts, et al – yes, society could recover land’s rental value every month. Tenants could afford periodic payments.

Leasing being feasible, rent totals tell a truer story. Rent, not price, is what measures the value of land. Ironically, to derive an aggregate rent, the process goes: Owners push rent to the limit, from that sellers set prices, from that specialists take a ratio of price to rent, divide price by it, and estimate a new number for rent— which everybody hopes equals the original amount. Fred Foldvary and Tim Worstall (Ch 13) sought their grand totals that way • HUD’s average selling price of apartment complexes (multi-family housing) was $1 million. Their annual average of rental receipts was $100k , one tenth. That ratio is about 10:1. • The OMB’s estimate of federal receipts from federal land was about $0.5 trillion. Ebeling’s estimated price for federal natural assets was $5.5t . Again the ratio is about 10:1. • The accumulated price for land from Zillow, Lincoln, and the BEA were about $27t − S28t . At that time, Quora figured we spend at least $2.72t on land (at least because Quora said the data they found had gaps). Once more, the 10 to 1 ratio holds. Applying the 10:1 ratio to our own estimate of the aggregate price of land puts land rent at $4.35 trillion. Yet we’re not finished. People don’t just pay a price or rent to own or control some land or resource. They also pay interest, insurance, taxes, etc for land. Census says the property tax was over $503 billion in 2016. Since then property has increased 43% , says Zillow, so property tax payments must by now exceed a half billion. So rounding up to $4.4 trillion is easily a safe bet. How can two of these totals be trillions more than mine? Mine left out portions of rural land value; in the countryside, there is more land than just farmland. And there is more “land” underground – oil and ores. Mason may have included what I could not find. Fred followed the lead of Dr Terry Dwyer (formerly at Harvard), an Australian who specializes in land calculations and used Aussie figures which are more reliable than US figures. A total for rent of five or six trillion, with a ratio of 10:1, puts the aggregate price of land at $53 or $60 trillion. That makes our aggregate price for land – $44t – seem not so huge after all.

Foldvary extrapolated from the experience of an expert, Dwyer. But a sum as big as $6t triggers the old, “If something seems too good to be true …” Can this be a mirage? Giving into doubters and relying on Albouy’s $30t as our base, let’s go with my $4.4 trillion, a decent ballpark figure. Per capita, that’s $2k/mnth or $24k annually. May this finding nudge statisticians and academics to refine our work – with great ease, since my text isn’t in jargon. Then we’ll compare my new standard to the estimates of mainstream economists and bureaucrats who’ll come later. Kicking off a discussion on rents would be progress, too. Recall those four plus trillions of dollars we just deduced for theworth of Earth in America? Incredible, eh? Am I pioneer? Or am I walking the plank above watery ignominy? Announce that all we spend on all the nature we use – from oil to atmosphere and every location in between – is grand. Some don’t want to hear it, like it’s bad news. What, they wanted society’s surplus to be small? Yet it’s understandable. Accustomed to the value of land and resources being tiny, then the bigger rent is, the harder it is for conventional economists to believe it – and admit how wrong they’ve been for so long. Thus the number of appreciators is inversely promotional to the actual quantity of rent. Conformist economists, though, must first bow to which way the wind is blowing, on behalf of their job security. It’s only logical that only a few of them would stick their necks out this early in the game, while most of them would ignore or criticize measuring the value of the factor in production that nobody created.

Even though my estimate was “not invented here,” our quest did inspire some appreciators among the insiders. Some not only replied to inquiries and replied helpfully but often did so with casual humor. That makes number-crunching less burden and more fun. Jeff, How much is land value? It’s a lot! (No pun intended :) It’s my understanding that the BEA (the people that do the GDP) is working on including land in the National Balance Sheet, but they’re not there yet. You would want to clarify whether you are talking just about “urban land” (that is, “real estate” land), or also land that is productive as such in its own right (without buildings) such as farmland, timberland, mining land. Also about whether to include dedicated open space (such as parks – how much is Central Park ‘worth’?). I don’t know why the Colorado legislature curtailed municipalities from taking advantage of the real estate transfer tax after Aspen adopted it to use for affordable housing. Two people that I think would be more well versed on the subject would be Mick I. and Rachel R., both of home have been heavily involved in local policy since at least the 1990s. Let me know if you need their contact information. Thank you! I too am occasionally bewildered when academics don’t create a consistent time series out of an index that could be consistently updated for just a fraction of the original work they put into it. Particularly because it guarantees them a steady stream of citations from people like me (see the Economic Uncertainty Index, for example) and, in some cases, even a series on FRED that untold researchers will end up using and citing. Zillow Research has the best home-value index, because they adjust it for the mix of homes in the area – it’s not distorted by the specific mix of homes on the market at any given time as other home-value indices often are.

In the household numbers you will see the assets that include tangible assets and report land and structures separately. CBO takes its estimates of the overall value of land in the nonfarm business sector from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We don’t include an estimate of the value of farmland. A benchmark for nonfarm land is estimated by applying a land-structure ratio based on unpublished estimates by the BLS to the value of structures. These ratios are based on data from 2001 for Ohio. This benchmark is extrapolated from Bureau of Economic Analysis investment data. The resulting nonfarm land data series is allocated to industries based on Internal Revenue Service data on book values of land. Land is assumed not to depreciate. I hope that helps. Regards, – Bob A, Unit Chief, Congressional Budget Office” Thank you for your question. The government does not determine the fair market value or appraised value for every piece of land the Federal government owns. Funds received for various rights (air, mineral, water, etc.) to real property, agencies may track those funds in their various internal systems, but it is not reported to the FRPP (Federal Real Property Asset Management) system I manage. These helpful respondents above represent the cutting edge within researchers come sniffing around, looking for reliable totals from official data gatherers, requesting a more rational methodology in their parsing of stats, then professionals such as the above are likely to deliver a finely honed total. Finally we’d have a number we could utilize to predict reliably and clarify how economies really work. Later, being better informed, with better ways to measure it, experts might expect the assessment of the amount of rent to total even higher. Tabulators would take account of more sources, like marina berths and note that a lot of interest on loans is actually rent. Putting it all together, that’s a scary thought for those who now insist the size of all rents is negligible. Over recent decades, inventors have made parts of nature exceed-ingly valuable, including an invisible part, the electromagneticspectrum for telecommunication. This ever-advancing technology also makes valuable, along with airwaves, the tangible, human-made cable networks for carrying digitized information.

Just as you pay for the rest of useful nature – typically paying rent (technical meaning) for the land beneath your home – you also pay rent for EM frequencies and for cables, strung on roadside poles or buried underground out of sight. Of course, you don’t pay directly, just as you don’t directly pay for farmland when you shop at the grocery store. But what you do pay does get passed along. And what you and the rest of us pay in order to telecommunicate, that gets added to the subtotal of what we all pay for the more familiar land. Thereby we get closer to determining how much is the total worth of Earth in America. • First, both are locations – frequencies in the spectrum, cables along the streets. • Second, both allow monopolies – telecomm corporations and utilities tend to giantism, controlling huge amounts of territory, just like those guys who own millions of acres. • Third, for those two reasons, whoever owns or controls cable networks or frequencies can charge well above cost – that is, both can charge (technical) rent. Consider the first point – location. Although human effort is necessary to build utilities, labor is far from sufficient. Just like in real estate, cation in nature: dams need river valleys, railroads need gradual grades, windmills and cell towers need hilltops, satellites need geosynchronous orbits, etc., as cables need rights of way. Otherwise, none of these goods can serve. Now, the second point – monopoly ownership. Electro-magnetic communication is the latest “natural monopoly.” Earlier came the power grid and before that water and sewers. Older still were the railroads, the big bad corporations of their day. The first natural monopoly were streets (below which are the routes for water and sewer). Imagine if different networks in the same region were to compete: parallel streets for cars, parallel cables for communications, parallel sewers for crap – not too efficient. In such cases, monopolies make more sense and are dubbed “natural.” Now, consider the third point, rent. As monopolies, utilities lack competition (duh). Not challenged by someone willing to accept a slimmer profit, whoever owns the utility monopoly is in a position to charge customers a steeper price, one well above cost. It’s something private ones tend to do while public ones don’t. Not only can utilities force prices up, they can also force costs down.

It’s something private ones tend to do while public ones don’t. Not only can utilities force prices up, they can also force costs down. Of course, location has no cost of production (since nobody produced it and nature never charges rent). But beyond that, since money means power, once utilities have enriched themselves – grossing over $400 billion in 2017 – they pretty much have the public’s servant (government) serving them. The trend may be getting even less favorable to the public. Some localities are selling their water systems to private corporations. Water is right up there with oxygen as a life-or-death necessity. When you look at how many hundreds of times greater than cost that pharmaceutical companies charge for life-saving drugs, one must wonder to what level will the price for water escalate? To avoid paying the public, businesses, naturally, prefer to turn public space and common space into their own private property (not that anyone needs privacy beneath a street or in orbit). Getting a never-expiring lease for some EM spectrum, which used to be entirely public property, for free, as TV networks get, was not good enough. Now, insiders and major corporations get to own frequencies, and the FCC lets these valuable gifts of nature go at well below market value.1 Virtually, it’s money for nothing. Anyone who uses a public or common space as their own will come to feel like it belongs to them. Restauranteurs who set tables and chairs on the public sidewalk feel like our public right-of-way belongs to them. Homeowners who park their car on the sidewalk feel the same. Whether encroachment by the less powerful among us or enclosure by the more powerful, it’s not an unusual human behavior. Even if commonplace, there’s still the matter of scale. The homeowner and cafe owner might profit somewhat by encroaching, while the enclosing utility corporation will gain big-time. Getting free use of a location beneath a street or in the EM spectrum or in outer space does save the corporation immense sums. Those savings, you may have noticed, do not routinely get passed on to customers as lower prices. Ironically, the issue of corporate ownership is irrelevant. Well, that is, if we set aside the power of money for a moment. In a practical sense, in order to draw revenue from natural monopolies, not only can government lease nature the public owns at full market value. It can also levy land and resources and spectrum that private parties own at their full, annual, monopoly rental values. Or try to.

Utilities, like landlords, land speculators, and mortgage lenders, enjoy being members of the tiny club of big rentiers. It’s to their advantage that the majority are unaware of rent. It’s to their benefit that conventional economists don’t study it, that mainstream statisticians don’t count it. Yet fortunately for us, somebody does, and their figures let us measure more of that stream of spending for natural goods and natural monopolies. Were prevailing political winds to blow that way, and were government to charge utilities full-market value for the monopoly franchise it grants the company, how much revenue could the government raise? Consider the electric companies that deliver the juice. At a minimum, government could recover the difference between the profit of public and private utilities, about $33 billion annually. That still leaves the value of the locations that utilities use. In 2015, utilities (except for the ones the Census Bureau left out) paid local and state governments $167 billion, presumably more now in 2019. Given the able resistance of the utility lobby to paying the public anything, those billions are likely to be well under the actual annual rental value of utility franchises and utility spaces. Closer to a fifth of a trillion is more realistic. It’d push our previous total (Ch 20) to $4.6 trillion. How much is that? Per capita, now the share would climb to over $2k per month for every registered voter. Could techno-progress make it possible to provide service without having to have a monopoly, letting in competition, and driving down price? It happened with telephones. If every home had its own power plant – say solar panels, as now it might have its own little garden – there’d be no need for electrical utilities. Already, a growing number of households are going off the grid. Not just “green” hippies but conventional companies, too, have turned to producing their own power. It’s a scenario not likely to warm the hearts of monopolists. And if we can foresee it, so can they. What steps are they taking? To date they’ve fought tooth and nail to maintain their advantage. Back when Edison and Tesla were competing to see whose electricity would dominate, the one that traveled long distances without losing lots of juice defeated the one more efficient at short distances.

RCA, which founded NBC (and was granted part of the broadcast spectrum for free), kept television from the American public for 20 years, until the patents of the actual inventor expired, so to avoid paying him his just reward. The only standing that corporate utilities have is a legal one, the government-granted title. They don’t have moral tradition. Indeed, just as General cum President Eisenhower warned us about the military/industrial complex, so did Thomas Jefferson warn us about bankers and corporations. Utilities are just lucky that the tradition of the commons has faded enough to have become invisible to most modern humans. Otherwise, customers might demand an accounting – and probably lower prices, too. • utilities whose power plants pollute the air basin; • companies that develop housing tracts sprawling over cornfields; • logging corporations that clear-cut mountain sides which … • silts up the stream you once fished; • maybe even causes a landslide that dislodges your house; • mining companies whose tailings contaminate groundwater; • chemical firms whose windblown GMO pollens contaminate farmers’ fertile soil; and • agri-businesses who treat soil like dirt, decreasing its fertility; If you choose to save somewhat upfront, yours is a world of opportunity. It’s cheaper living in the shadow of a skyscraper that blocks out sunlight than in the penthouse with a view of 360 degrees; beside a freeway with constant noise and smog versus even a block away with cleaner air and a measure of quiet; and near a landfill perfuming the neighborhood versus far away. If you can not afford environmental health, likely you live where land values are already low. Then add a trash incinerator (or prison, weapons factory, or tobacco subsidy). Land values won’t always fall and may even rise, since tax-supported jobs pay better and developers respond with better houses. While these incomplete lists tilt toward producers, consumers too choose convenience over long-term health. Most of us drive. Some homeowners spray poison on their lawn. Truckers leave their diesel engines running. Shoppers prefer packages of “food” (low nutrition, high additives). Households contribute generously to landfills. It’s an attitude.

Going about our business that way, harming the health of Earth, we depress the worth of Earth, ceteris paribus (all else being equal). While people pay less for despoiled land upfront, the despoliation forces people to pay much more for other things downstream: restoring the environment, healing ourselves, and for inefficient production. Were we not despoiling Earth, we could use those payments to build up her worth. Hence those payments for rehabilitation are surrogate rents and count toward a complete total for the value of land and resources. So when a village wanted to do something collectively – say, build a watermill – the group of residents who actually made it happen became a temporary part of the local government. That is, they incorporated into the body politic (“corpus” means “body”) and enjoyed the council’s limited liability. When the project was completed, the corporate charter and the limited liability with it expired. But investors could not leave well enough alone. Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father very interested in the power in the land and with an insightful opinion about many topics, lamented that the younger generation, lacking the “…principles of ’76 now look to a single and splendid government of an Aristocracy, founded on banking institutions and monied corporations.…” Then came James Watt’s steam engine and industrialization. If a train locomotive roaring by set your cornfield afire, you could sue – and actually win. To avoid restitution, or even bankruptcy, for businessmen limited liability was too good an idea to ignore. Exerting the pressure that comes with impressive profits, industrialists persuaded politicians to grant them a corporate charter. What once covered temporary nonprofit groups acting for the commonweal, now limited the liability of permanent companies acting in their own self-interest. To limit their liablity personally, the businessmen – “corporations” in the US, “limiteds” in the UK – paid no more than a small filing fee. If found liable, management fobbed off the fine or penalty from themselves, the responsible humans, onto an abstract corporation; those who ultimately paid were stockholders and consumers – even taxpayers. The real perpetrators in management skated. In the US, individuals faded into the background and corporations became “persons.” A railroad lawyer who was a clerk for the Supreme Court wrote in his own hand on the cover of an unrelated ruling that corporations were persons.

The Justices and everyone else even up until today accepted his radical penmanship. he problem with pollution is like the problem with politics. In politics, those few who band together to gain a lot have much more success lobbying than those many who stay disorganized and individually lose a little. Similarly, those few who pollute a lot do so with impunity while those many who receive a little poison seldom defend themselves – and rarely do they win. For a business that is a bad neighbor, the more damage you do, the more you need a limit on your liability. For those guys, after the land title, the corporate charter might be the second most valuable piece of paper dished out by government. Heck, only a direct handout or bailout – cold cash in the pocket – could be better. To stay afloat, insurance companies would not be so accommodating but charge full market value for limiting liability. Businesses imposing risks on others – polluters, depleters, and wasters – would pay premiums of staggering amounts. Firms not endangering consumer, worker, or nature would pay less. Until that fine day, we’ll still have more lawyer jokes than economist jokes. Just as economists don’t discuss land much, most don’t discuss environment, either, except to refer to its debasement as an “externality.” The term implies that such damages were unavoidable consequences with no one at fault, instead of results of irresponsible behavior, like littering or reckless driving. Thus academics defuse the responsibility of wealthy and powerful industry. If your tracks need covering, it must be nice to have an entire discipline to do it for you. Yet can an apologist be a scientist? Conversely, economists don’t refer to the value of land as a “positive externality.” Yet the value of a property is not due to the owner who gets to sell it or lease it. Rather, as everyone knows, it’s due to location, location, location – to natural features like a good view and social features like a nearby transit stop. By not referring to land value as an externality, economists deprive society of its authorship and look the other way when owners reap something for nothing. As a positive externality, publicly recovered rent would not take any private value from anyone. W hile we think we save money by being sloppy and not cleaning upafter ourselves, we don’t.

It’s not just that we raise costs for society, for people downstream and downwind, we also miss out on cutting our own costs. Wasting and leaving behind waste is wasteful, a loss. A win/ win is a company that captures sulfur from smokestack exhaust; it thereby has another product to sell. Efficiency is a savings, an untapped resource. An engine that burns all its fuel not only leaves zero residue to pollute but also gets more miles per gallon. In response to higher standards enforcing our right to a healthy planet, some businesses would raise their prices – and lose customers, market share, stockholders, share value – possibly go broke. Other businesses would make money by being efficient. Smart dirty industries would convert to clean technologies – which in most cases already await them on shelves. Clean companies would gain market share. With bigger operations, clean companies could streamline, enjoy economies of scale. Both the always clean and the newly clean would see their cost of doing business fall. Already firms that win “green” certification don’t lose money but save. With the extra wherewithal, these successful businesses could spend more on a better commercial location. Thus, one can estimate the missing value of the environment from its balance sheet: (1) downstream payments that degradation imposes on us, such as dealing with radioactive waste;(2) the loss in value of degraded areas, like neighborhoods near toxic dumpsites; (3) a portion of spending on medical treatment; and (4) the savings from greater efficiency in doing business. Combining the four tells us how much more we would have available to bid up the rent for living and working on healthy land. A hefty portion of that is by how much the worth of Earth in America would rise. If a business did not harm a customer, worker, or nature and get sued and pay lawyers, it’d have lots more money to invest elsewhere. In 2008, eLawForum estimated litigation cost corporations $210 billion, equivalent to one-third of the after-tax profit of the Fortune 500. Not all those suits were filed because of pollution but some were.

Not in Mexico but in America, drinking tap water sickens 20 million annually at some cost. Treating fresh water, polluted by agri-biz’s phosphorus and nitrogen, a decade ago was costing over $4.3 billion annually. Cleaning up the 126,000 polluted groundwater sites in America would cost from $110 billion to $127 billion. The true cost of emissions, factoring in costs of premature death, illness, increased loads on the healthcare system, lowered crop yields, missed work days, higher insurance damages from extreme weather events linked to climate change, etc., pumps up the price of a gallon of gasoline; in 2015 you’d pay $3.80 more at the pump. pollutants in the air we breathe exacerbate asthma, shortening the lives of newborns and the elderly. Furthermore, the incidence of autism and Alzheimer’s is higher along high-traffic streets. But because those roads are busy, which raises location value, it’s hard to tell how much smog lowers site value. We tolerate polluted air in part because driving is convenient – or so we think. Ivan Illich added the time it takes to make the money to afford driving and added it to time sitting in our cars – crawling around sprawl far from the lively city center or stuck in traffic, feeling frustrated while worsening our well-being. He found cars actually carry us at four miles an hour. Of course, very few make that calculation, since they don’t have to drop a quarter into a meter every quarter mile for fuel, repairs, insurance, purchase, fees, smog damage, health impairment (cars are fattening), etc. Failing to charge drivers the equivalent of rent for using roadway land underprices driving. That zero charge thus underprices roads compared with other uses of land. Hence society devotes extra land to roads – a major source of pollution from engines and tires, and less to walking paths, bikeways, light-railways, and other modes that pollute not at all or much less. Making roads appear free creates more automobile dependency, which encourages more sprawl onto farmland. In 2014, Eosta, which focused on waste in agriculture, put global costs of eco-damage at $4.8 trillion. A year before, TruCost added agri-business (not normally publicly traded and so left out before) to their list of culprits damaging the planet.

He figured that external costs to US taxpayers totaled $3.5 trillion in 1995 – four times higher than the profits of US corporations that year ( $822 billion).2 Nearly a quarter century later, it’s likely higher. ust as the estimates for total land value were not easy to come by and were all over the place, it’s the same with the estimates of land damage. Another caveat: Once humans stop fouling their nest, they’d not use every saved dollar on bidding up the value of the location they want for themselves. But some of those saved dollars would go to that purpose. Using TruCost’s $1.5 trillion as a floor and Estes’s $3.5 trillion as a ceiling, let’s go with the midway $2.5t . If Americans got to save all that, they might spend $1.4t on bidding up the value of land. Adding the cost of degradation to our growing total ( S4.6 t,Ch :22) would push the overall total for rents in America to about $6 trillion (how much BlackRock manages, Ch 12). Per capita/registered voter that is $3k/mnth . Along with corporate charters, waivers of standards, and lenient enforcement, government grants other little pieces of paper worth trillions. These new official forms likewise grant monopolies and are major sources of rent. The streams of spending they corral also need to be added to the total flow of what we spend on the nature we use. For us to tabulate the worth of Earth in America in total, we need to know more than the value of land and resources, more than the value of the unowned environment, and more than the padded profit of landbased monopolies like utilities. We also need to know the padded profit of monopolies based on the very land-like field of knowledge. That is, we need to know the rent from holding patents and copyrights, whose purpose is to exclude competitors. Humans of our era understand that matter is an expression of energy, energy is an expression of subatomic particles, and subatomic particles are an expression of natural laws.

The realm of logical solutions is as much a part of nature as is planet Earth. All of it exists without the input of any human’s labor or capital. And the best parts – the best locations – are extremely valuable. Besides applying “hers” labor and capital, that owner could exclude others from the best that nature has to offer. Minus competitors, that owner can grab an extra, unearned profit. And besides keep out others – as absentee ownership is the granddaddy of all privileges – that owner can step aside and let in others to use “hers” land or idea, for a price, like a troll under the bridge permitting passage. Both that price and that extra profit are rent. Along with rent for environment and utilities, those incomes augment the worth of Earth in America. To spur ingenuity during the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the authors of the US Constitution included patents and copyrights. P&C, like land titles, professional licenses (e.g., medical), corporate charters, and utility franchises, also took nobody’s labor or capital to create – other than the labor to lobby and the capital to make campaign contributions. As Americans spread from the East Coast across the continent, they won from the federal government land patents granting a monopoly, over a sector of land instead of over a section of harmonious possibility. Getting a patent or copyright is like planting a flag somewhere on the realm of logical solutions. If the location is a good one, by posting that “No Trespassing” sign the claimant can exclude others and charge a rent. Since government does not charge full market value for its patents and copyrights, the amount that the government does not charge is also rent. This rent differs from that of utilities. The doctors’ monopoly is not natural but artificial. While it would be impractical to have parallel sewers compete, it’d not be impractical to let all doctors compete. On the contrary, it’d be quite efficient to have more doctors competing among themselves. And with experienced nurses, too. Owning aspects of nature differs from owning things that we do create.

Similarly, when you keep your idea to yourself and prevent others from building on it, then you hobble scientific progress. Before any humans discovered North America thousands of years ago – whether entering from Siberia or Scandinavia – it existed. Before anyone discovered waves of gravity, they existed. And before anyone worked out the functions of trigonometry, they existed as logical patterns, the only forms that could exist. Long before humans were able to discover them, such useful parts of nature were already available. Then each discovery underpinned the next. Just as long voyages to explore virgin territory depended on already occupying a home base and employing logic, so did learning the ways of the physical world depend on a pre-existing base of knowledge and following reason. As Sir Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen further than others it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Those shoulders belonged to thinkers like Copernicus and Bruno (who was burned at the stake). Later, if James Clerk Maxwell had not died young, he may have discovered e = mc2 before Einstein but at least he paved the way for Albert. Some discoveries don’t pay off in money. Indians were first to populate the Americas but did not make much off real estate speculation. Teams of scientists collaborated to discover gravity waves but none became rich in the process. And neither Isaac Newton nor Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz marketed calculus. Only those who came after profited from such discoveries, usually due to excluding others. Our privatizing of knowledge goes back millennia. The ancient Phoenicians gave their captains the order to sink their ship before allowing a pirate or foreign nation to capture it and discover the secret that allowed Phoenicians to sail from one end of the Mediterranean to the other – only the Punic sailors knew how to caulk their ships with tar. Centuries later, other Arabs kept secret the formula for steel which made their scimitars so much more deadly than heavy iron swords.

Although two people cannot occupy the same space at the same time, two people can utilize the same equation at the same time. My acquiring knowledge does not mean you have any less knowledge. Yet discoverers of logical solutions deserve reward. Do we moderns owe the descendants of Newton and Leibniz untold fortunes? Similar to how much we pay today’s authors of code, such as the Google guys? How far do the benefits of being first extend? Could the first crew of canoeists landing on what’s now Alaska claim all North and South America? Could the crew member who was first to set foot on the beach be the one to be entitled to the Western Hemisphere? And for how long? Forever? By now, with every inhabitable corner of the planet already inhabited, nobody can claim to be first. Nobody can even claim to descend from whoever arrived first, since tribes have always wandered all over the face of the earth. The one to win a patent for the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, walked out the door of the Patent Office as another inventor of the telephone (Elisha Gray) walked in. Should the guy a few minutes late win nothing and the guy a few minutes early win everything? What if the person who patented or copyrighted first was not the one who discovered or invented first? Snooze, you lose? Everything forever? Patents and copyrights prevent late-comers and anyone else from ex-ploring that particular part of the physical world and deducing a similar correct answer. People accept the notion that P&C protect the little guy – the basement inventor, the unheralded author. Yet it’s a star system; only a very few inventors and authors make any money from their patent, or composers from their copyright. While patents and copyrights are justified as ways to encourage creativity, they do just the opposite. Big companies like IBM get literally thousands of patents each year, and little companies called “trolls” get bunches of patents, too. The bigs and not-so-bigs do this not to use the aspect of nature that they’ve staked out, but so that you can’t. They’re a dog in the manger, putting a roadblock in the path of progress. • Ford for a while was untouchable thanks to patents plus gangsters purchasing getaway cars and police forces, too, to chase them; • Johnson & Johnson is still the biggest pharmaceutical due to patents and limited liability (drugs do harm, too); • More recently, giants Amazon, Apple, and Facebook benefited from patents and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242998_cleaned.txt:69:6a2270b6da05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1118, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "the aspect of nature that they’ve staked out, but so that you can’t.

At its core, a successful business has a great new idea. But a giant business at its core has that plus a stockpile of patents. Giantism cannot flourish in a truly free market. It can only come about with the helping hand of the state. Government assistance – that’s where super wealthy families come from and what turns I.T. multi-millionaires into I.T. multi-billionaires. Ironically, today’s tech giants may be on their way to utility status, or even there already, and become subject to regulation. Society may legitimately wonder, with this right to exclude, does any responsibility or duty come with it? Like, you may own it, but for excluding every other person from that part of nature, do you owe them compensation for never letting them go there? Do humans have an equal right to all parts of nature? Sometimes a discoverer can get a patent but never make a penny. Usually the gizmo is not marketable, but often the innovator gets ripped off. Almost all inventors and artists are too poor and desperate to have the leverage to negotiate a fair contract. Hence there are innumerable cases wherewhere recording artists make peanuts while record companies keep hundreds of millions from the sales, and of people, like the inventor of the windshield-wiper, fighting Ford his entire working career to win the profit he was owed (he eventually won the case, but lost his family in doing so). Sometimes, a discoverer can eschew the patent and make a bundle. Usually with a partner, the team take the new idea to market before anyone else, become the best known to consumers, and get a head start on any competition. They “corner the market,” make a pile of money, then even more by maintaining the largest market share. All that gain would be due to their labor and capital, none of it would be due to keeping everyone else out of that particular arena. None would be rent. For granting a patent to an unsellable invention, government charges the same amount as for a patent protecting a hot new app. For granting a title to a quarter acre in Death Valley, government charges the same amount as for a title to a corner lot in midtown Manhattan.

For next to nothing, holders of patents and deeds get to exclude everyone, for a long period of time, and win this without having to compensate society. In the mid 1950s, when polio was crippling kids (earlier President FDR), Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed an effective vaccine at nearly the same time. Both chose not to patent their vaccines worth millions, maybe billions. By the way, outside the US, Sabin is more famous for eradicating polio than Salk. And both built on the work of the unheralded Hilary Koprowski. While those researchers may have had feeble profit motives, some businesses with a robust profit motive declined to patent and still struck it rich. Coca-Cola is the classic. Oracle and Google, both worth multi-billion-dollars, had almost no patents until a few years ago. Then, notes law professor Dennis Crouch (private email), they won patents not to establish dominance but to solidify dominance. Rather than hinder progress, a patent fee in line with actual market value would spur inventors and investors to form partnerships. Same with filmmakers and distributors. Nobody would sit on a good idea. Just the opposite of now when an owner of a prime site can let it lie fallow, waiting to cash in later. Cheaper than patents for discoveries are copyrights for creations – they’re free. Because creations such as stories (some say there are only three … or six … or nine basic plots) can be retold endlessly, even if copyrighted, society loses nothing. Often a creator does not want a copyright. When you hear a new joke, you have no idea who first told it. And why should a jokester not freely contribute to society? t’s standard practice for the government to let Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Iand many other tech companies use copyrighted material without a license from the copyright holder. In 2007, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (which includes the tech giants) figured this legal evasion accounted for much of the growth of the previous decade and generated more than $4.5 trillion in annual revenue. 1 How much of that would tech companies be willing to pay as rent?

The US stock market in 2018 is $30 trillion, so IP is $24t . Converting from price to rent puts rent at $3t . Kevin A. Hassett and Robert J. Shapiro, who do estimates for a living, calculated a total for intellectual capital (patents, copyrights, databases, and general business methods). In 2011 it was as high as $9.2 trillion. Since that figure approaches the then-current GDP, those guys must have meant price, not annual value. Rent would’ve been $92t . In 2013, a partnership of statisticians for private business put patents at over $5.8 trillion, almost half of the then GDP. The US Patent Office also estimates how much IP – including IT workers and sales and the leverage of exclusion – contributes to the economy.2 In 2016, they figured over $6 trillion,8 close to the $5.8t three years earlier. Since neither figure is a lump sum price but an annual flow, how much of that is rent – profit due just to exclusion? It’s hard to say but $2 trillion is reasonable. Add that $2 trillion to the $6t we reached by adding utility franchises and eco-losses to land and resources; the new total reaches $8 trillion. That’s equivalent to the drop in global stock prices in January 2016, to what it would it take to wipe out the US federal deficit, and to how much builders worldwide spend in one year on putting locations to better use. Per capita of registered voters comes to $4k per month. Eight trillion approaches half of total national income. That’s bigger than either the returns to labor (mostly wages) or to capital (to lenders and investors). (With land, labor and capital are the other two factors in production.) That means the value of our output is due less to anyone’s input – labor or capital – and more to nature and privilege. In other words, you spend more for what nobody created – directly and indirectly – than you pay others for their efforts. If $8t sounds unbelievable, it’s going to get worse. We’ve reached this height without yet figuring in two more major sources of rents: finance and taxation. Because rent is much money for doing nothing, it attracts speculators.

Me burning up my adding machine blazes a new trail. Only a few researchers make educated guesses and those always slight the land. Even at eight trillion dollars, the count could be an underestimate. Under-estimate is what officials do. Getting clear is what they don’t do (Ch 18). Nor do economists, and bureaucrats after them, show interest in noting the two kinds of spending. One rewards the efforts of workers, the other rewards the ownership and privileges of others. However, our real opponents are found among the rich and powerful who now receive the lion’s share of our spending for nature and privilege. Lenders of mortgages, owners of oil companies, holders of patents, exercise their considerable power to keep real rent statistics under wraps (Ch 12). Even the middle-class, with inconsiderable power, prefer to ignore that their lesser captures of rent are unearned. Thomas Piketty became a celebrity with his fat bestseller, Capital in the poor get poorer due to ownership (or lack) of capital, or so he said. Piketty used “capitalists” and “the rich” as synonyms and proposed taxing them. Similarly, the tax code calls income derived without having to apply labor or capital “capital gains”, rather than “land gains” or “privilege gains”. Reed College (in Portland Oregon) graduate Matthew Rognlie while still a grad student at MIT noted that capital—factories and skyscrapers— depreciates; it’s land—especially urban land—that appreciates. As do most in his discipline, Matt mislabeled land as “real estate”. What captures the surplus that functional economies naturally exude is not buildings or any sort of capital but land, becoming the father of enduring fortunes.1 Sitting side by side with Piketty on a televised panel discussion, Joseph Stiglitz echoed Rognlie, saying it’s not owning capital that widens the income gap but owning land. Piketty did not acknowledge the point. And making the point was the former Chief Economist of the World Bank, a winner of the ersatz “Nobel” prize, and a professor at Columbia. n keeping with their penchant for changing names and definitions, Ieconomists no longer use “capital” to refer to heads of cattle (the term’s original meaning) or to tools, factories, and supplies (in contrast with consumable goods). Rather, they just mean big piles of money, stuff of investments and huge savings accounts.

Building on Philippon and Reshef ’s research, Epstein and Montecino estimate wage rent (excess wages with excess profits) to be $1.4 trillion between 1990 and 2005. Adding losses from slower growth and recession brings it up to $3.7 trillion. They project that from 1990 to 2023, this number would add up to $22.7 trillion. Leading up to the recent recession, the American financial system (by which Epstein and Montecino mean Wall Street, not credit unions and community currencies), increasingly failed at providing basic banking services and became more involved in ground trafficking. Their solution? Rules and regulators, no matter how much the bureaucracy would cost. eople love to hate the government – it’s bloated, it’s wasteful, it’s all P about favoritism, etc., etc. – yet we want more of it. Like Woody Allen’s joke about the two Jewish ladies complaining about the terrible food at the resort they went to in the Catskills. Not only bad – there was never enough of it! The role of the state as the main cause (or cure) of collapse pales beside the role of rents, our payments for the essentials of life. Only after we’ve acquired food (from land) and housing (on land) do we then purchase furniture, appliances, cars, etc. When we must pay more for the former, we can only purchase less of the latter (a recession). The world’s foremost organic gardener offered advice. Author of The One Straw Revolution, Masanobu Fukuoka said, “When something goes wrong in my garden, I think first not what to do but what to undo.” Applied to financial collapses, regulations and the rest of the apparatus would be what not to do. But what would be what to do? Find another use for rent, other than reward speculation? W hat could show others the error of their ways? The harder you try to intrigue the likeliest receptors, the more stubborn they get. Your facts not only fall on deaf ears but also raise pointy hackles. Psychological research shows that people set in their ways merely entrench themselves even deeper into what they “know to be true.” Staying loyal to ideology suits human nature. Once you know the role of rent and the magnitude of rent, the only thing left to do is be a lone wolf howling in the wilderness where the trees are silent, to howl with each rising moon and each Earth rise, until the howl is heard.

Totals for the surplus output of the economy must get out – as must the story of why the effort is so lonely and difficult. Could the number for the size of rent be found stashed somewhere? Could the total of the value of land, resources, and privilege be greater than already calculated? Could a smoking gun – a memo calling for the proper ensconcing of rent – be found anywhere? If so, where? Where is a sump for all the significant statistics? And who towers over the myriad of number crunchers? As they say, follow the money. Who makes the most money off the Earth? What institutions do those aristocrats control? Let us soldier on into the belly of the beast, the Federal Reserve. To whom else can we turn? Can we get some ten-year-old kid to hack the Fed? ( Joke). Will finding out the size of our spending for nature and privilege – our social surplus – wake up Leviathan? • It has the power to tabulate all rents, what with its huge staff and ability to demand data from member banks. And … • It has a good reason to know the size of that spending stream. Knowing how much society spends to use locations, the central bank can predict how big its income will be, and when a current wave of rent may recede. While the US was created to be a democracy by democrats, the Fed was created to be a printing press by and for plutocrats. Our newest central bank took over the power to create new money, a function that the Constitution had charged to Congress. That means the Fed gets to control the money supply. The Fed claims to be a part of the government, which does underwrite it and other global banks. However, during the 2019 shutdown, the government mothballed its websites from lack of funding, while the Fed had its own funds to keep its up and running. We say “print money” only out of habit. Paper money is for common people in their daily business. Between major players, transactions are usually worth at least 10 figures. For those deals, a big bank taps keys on a computer and – poof! – transfer complete.

The Fed says they buy bonds and other paper assets. Yet their buying bears no relation to your or my buying. When you lack the cash yet purchase, first you borrow and go into debt. When the Fed lacks the cash yet purchases, once again you go into debt; you’re obliged to pay the taxes that pay off the US bond that the Fed “bought” without money. The money was never transferred from Fed to bond seller but simply appeared in the US Treasury’s account. Spending non-money is not counterfeiting, but the Fed did design their notes to look exactly like United States notes, which they are not. What they do is legal but misleading, like the bankers’ naming their prize “Nobel.” he Fed makes it easy to take on debt, public and private, when it extends credit to member banks and the government. The banks create more mortgages. Congress deficit-spends. Since the last recession, the Fed has tripled its holding of US Treasury notes. Government spending has not kept pace, but it has not slowed, either. Without spending a penny – since none of the pennies formerly existed – the Fed over-expands the money supply, resulting in inflation. Borrowers like inflation. You borrow dollars that are worth more and pay back with plentiful dollars that are worth less. Yet lenders like inflation, too; banks are debtors. The average debt-to-equity ratio for retail and commercial US banks, as of January 2015, is approximately 2:2. For investment banks, the average debt/equity is higher, about 3:1. Repaying with cheap dollars works for banks, too. Excess-dollars inflates some costs faster, some slower, or not at all. You go to the supermarket and find food costs more, but has your salary risen by a like amount? Not likely. Who benefits? Not the wage-earner. Who benefits are those who can buy low (early) and sell high (later). So, if you’re first in line to get the fresh cash, you can make hay while the sun shines. Typically, that’s people whose lobbyists stalk the corridors of power and whose money managers trade in big blocks of stock, bonds, and real estate.

Since the Fed started replacing US Notes with their own in 1913, the dollar began losing its value at a rate unlike before. When the US stopped “backing” the dollar with gold (1971), then the Fed could print to its heart’s content. Americans could not turn to gold coins, being rarely minted, and stamped with a purchasing power far less than the gold’s intrinsic value. Inflation since 1971 has soared. Over the past century, the dollar has lost 96% of its former value. In real-speak: The cost of living has risen accordingly. On occasion, bankers (those typically in charge of the lone legal currency) have issued less new money, which supposedly had the opposite effect and deflated prices, ceteris paribus. But things are not all equal. During the Great Depression – an exceptional era – bankers drastically shrank the supply of money and credit. Ever since, the economics profession and its pundits in the press have been able to use the specter of deflation as an excuse for the policy of inflation. However, a closer look at that Depression yields more powerful factors. Every time, during that lost decade-and-more, the economy showed signs of recovery, the government intervened. FDR’s New Deal meant destruction of crops and cattle, tariffs on trade, taxes on investment, curbs on competition between producers, union wages well above commensurate output which entrenched unemployment, etc. Refusing to lend may have been an error but worse ones were made. Is it wise to fear deflation? Throughout the history of our species, humans are constantly building the better mousetrap. By driving down costs, prices should follow. It’s the excessive supply of money that won’t let the lower cost of living appear before consumers. In reality, a shrinking supply of money in circulation would suffice in an economy always finding ways to get more from less. Bankers and politicians say they created the central bank to balance inflation and unemployment by controlling interest rates. However, that method has proven itself ineffective – the economy still exhibits plenty of both; as did inflation, unemployment soared. Further, that method – and the central bank that wields it – is not necessary.

When the Fed credits lesser banks in exchange for their bonds, those banks have more to lend to borrowers, who are mainly homebuyers. That means more demand for housing, inflating the price for land, swelling the mortgages. While mortgages still stand out in banks’ portfolios, the value of locations can also be part of a business loan or asset management. It’s hard to pinpoint how much land enriches banks. Hence, the truest value of land is not during the peak – the pre-collapse apex when exuberant speculators engage in a feeding frenzy. Nor is it during recession when many wannabe buyers lack the wherewithal. Rather, it’s at some mid-point in the business cycle that paying for land – usually beneath a house – claims around one-fourth of one’s income. To help their ilk laboring away in high-rise office buildings on Wall Street, the Fed “buys” bundles of mortgages from the big banks (much more now than ever), turning the Fed into a de facto landlord. It’s also an actual landlord; of the Fed’s “assets,” over 10% is land – concrete collateral, for a change. How much and how valuable is the land the Fed could foreclose on? Sorry, economists are not telling. Thousands of them find jobs with-in the Federal Reserve. At seven top journals, 84 of the 190 editorial board members were affiliated with the Federal Reserve in one way or another. Journal articles determine which economists get tenure and what ideas are considered respectable. Criticism of the central bank has become a career liability for members of the profession, which silences economists (never a bold bunch to begin with). While the Fed rides herd on economists, it bestows blessings on insiders. In the year before a presidential election, the Fed tightens monetary policy if a Democrat is in office and loosens it if a Republican is in office. When banks lend less, there’s less business, and voters blame the party in power.

Our seeing lobbyists and the lobbied as different entities is only superficial; the elite and the state are actually a partnership. The audit of Fed books revealed what they wanted kept from the public – how many trillions was their bailout and to whom extended. Even after the audit, the Fed kept doling out credits to their associates – their “quantitative easing”. They rescued not just banks but also corporations and not just ones headquartered in the US but foreign ones, too. They didn’t stop inflating the value of big business until they’d created and lent nearly $30 trillion dollars. How many dollars is that? If you were to receive them as silver dollars and stack them up then climb them, you’d be on Mars. That’s a lot of silver, Tonto. The recipients of the bailouts found it easy to pay back such huge sums. Getting bailed out confirmed their status as too big to fail, so their stocks and bonds seemed safer to investors. The recipients not only stayed afloat but also swallowed up competitors who were not bailed out (like Lehman), expanding their market share. Recipients used the money they got at close-to-zero interest to buy US bonds which paid a few percentage points – magnified by the huge sums, a tidy profit – all guaranteed. From the POV of the biggies, while miracles are nice, bailouts are mandatory – a gratifying success for recent recipients. However, for many others, such as those who lost their homes, the bailouts never tricked down. For the public at large, the recession was a missed opportunity for Shumpeter’s creative destruction – sweep out the old bankrupt institutions (literally and figuratively) and usher in the new. Banks, when functioning well, safeguard savings. When one’s savings are many millions – even billions – a local bank is way too small; a global bank fits much better. With investments worldwide and influence internationally, its dividends dwarf its interest payments. Mega-banks stabilize fortune, becoming a place to park hundreds of millions of dollars. When big banks control a central bank, risk to fortune is virtually eliminated. In 1910, the richest financiers of the richest families met in secret on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia, not to reform the economy so it would work right for everyone but to curb its mood swings that panicked the very rich.

In 1913, the night before recessing for the Christmas break, when few members were still in session, Congress approved their plan to create a central bank. Rather than rename it the “US National Bank,” an entity that the popular sentiment had eradicated twice before, financiers christened their corporation the “US Federal Reserve.” Ironically, the Federal Reserve is neither federal nor a reserve. The US president does rubber-stamp each new Chairman of the Reserve and the Fed does pay the Treasury royalties annually. However, the Fed has a corporate charter and stockholders (whose identity is debated). Nor does it keep a reserve of its own cash for a rainy day but rather holds IOUs from lesser banks, corporations, and governments, along with smaller amounts of US notes, foreign currency, and gold. Goldman Sachs of New York (which supplies so many Secretaries of the Treasury), JP Morgan Chase Bank of New York, Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York, Lehman Brothers of New York (now amalgamated into Barclay’s of London), N.M. Rothchild of London, Rothchild Bank of Berlin, Warburg Bank of Hamburg, Warburg Bank of Amsterdam, Lazard Brothers of Paris, and Israel Moses Seif Bank of Italy. That arrangement between financiers and government did not sit well with everybody. Back in the Great Depression, one congressman, Louis T. McFadden, having served as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee for more than 10 years, brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Secretary of United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts, including but not limited to, conspiracy, fraud, unlawful conversion, and treason. The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee and has yet to be acted on. (Sort of like Congress illegally refusing to call a Constitutional Convention.) The four major US lenders, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, own the four major oil extractors – Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, and Chevron Texaco, in tandem with Deutsche Bank, BNP, Barclays and other European old-money behemoths. Those four big US banks are among the top ten stockholders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation. Marine Major-General Smedley Butler confessed, “I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street, and the bankers.

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.” The bankers who own the Fed lend heavily to munitioneers during war time. They also have a voice in the subsequent peace. At the end of the First World War, Jack Morgan, J. Pierpont’s son and successor, presided over the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which led both German and Allied reconstruction efforts. The US still backs up big banks and big brokers. A US court, well out of its jurisdiction, ruled that Argentina owed a pair of New York speculators for a debt that Argentina had already paid. In 2012 the US Navy detained an Argentinian warship until Argentina transferred the disputed amount. Bigger scale, since the fall of the Iron Curtain, the US military has invaded Muslim nations. Before the interventions, all of them had several independent banks; afterwards, each had one central bank. Unlike many disparate banks, one central bank gets integrated into the global banking system. The Federal Reserve has outsourced their job (as have many public agencies) of tabulating the value of land. Nowadays they limit their role to being a middleman and introducing curious researchers to the private firm that they, the Fed, uses. For the right price, that firm will provide an answer. Yet if that firm can tally up the rents, the vastly more powerful Fed can, too. You can see why a programming whiz would be tempted to hack the Fed, though not me.

And not because the Fed has its own oversized and well-equipped police force. And not because the Fed collaborates with the Secret Service, all of which would really chill an interview. But because, first, hacking is snooping, and second, many useful statistics are already available. We ought to be able to cobble together a figure from them. Paul Samuelson, economist emeritus MIT, had the bestselling textbookof his era, Foundations of Economic Analysis, one of the best of all time. In early editions, he explained rent; in later ones, that part was missing. Why delete a discussion on payments for one of the three basic factors in production? It makes no economic sense; oblivious to rent, economists cannot understand surplus or make accurate forecasts. Rather, the decision must’ve made prudent political sense, appeasing the prevailing winds within the discipline and surrounding it. Economists are anything but objective, with no axe to grind; they can be as politically opinionated as anybody. Blaming their favorite fall-guy is where most analysts halt their peeling of the onion. One sees what one expects, and upon finding that does not dig any deeper. On their less than rigorous analysis they base their recommendations. One insider, peeved at the policies of his cohorts, charged them with practicing “flat-earth economics.”1 While economists don’t count how much society spends on the nature it uses, they don’t want anyone else to measure it, either. Like specialists everywhere, the economists, the statisticians, the bureaucrats, act out the Priesthood Syndrome. Within economia, the hierarchy in which they rank each other excludes the uninitiated, the questers after a solid figure for society’s surplus. When it comes to one part of the economy, natural resources and privileges, it seems economists know neither price nor value. Even though economies generate a surplus – a fat one, if they’d only measure it (Ch 25) – economists abide by the frame of “scarce resources.” Their fake poverty consciousness reinforces society’s poverty consciousness. And makes abundance too good to be true. Rather than be scientifically correct, economists must be professionally correct. All know that the richest Americans founded the US central bank, and that the Fed and bankers in general are outwardly dismissive toward land. If the most powerful fiscal institution on the planet snubs rent, why should anyone else, especially anyone hoping for a career in the field, research rent? Most don’t go there.

If the most powerful fiscal institution on the planet snubs rent, why should anyone else, especially anyone hoping for a career in the field, research rent? Most don’t go there. By de-legitimizing land, politics has discouraged any would-be real scientists. Instead, academics concern themselves with topics that their colleagues care about – marginal cost, elasticity, etc. And the academic press publishes reams and reams of papers – mere embroidery of little utility. So, less relevant issues become most important and the most relevant issue takes on the tone of “flakey.” While economists show great solicitude toward the elite, some sociologists show consideration toward the lowly. Sociologists used to conduct the wallet test; they’d leave wallets in train stations around the world to measure morality regarding property. The closer to the equator, where people are poorer, the more likely the finder just kept the billfold. The closer to the poles, where nations are developed, the more likely the finder tried to return it (even without accepting a reward). After a few years of testing, sociologists no longer wanted to potentially embarrass poor people. Yet right off the bat, economia chose not to annoy the rich and diligently overlooked surplus wealth. Economists not only ignore the nature of land – its ability to consume the lion’s share of our spending – but also ignore the nature of customs. They treat the sanctity of property, for example, as immutable as the law of supply and demand, a physical law. We deal with laws like gravity by engineering solutions, and deal with customs like, say, gleaning of fields by the poor after harvest, by aiming shotguns and hiring lawyers. If you treat phenomena that can change the same as you treat phenomena that can’t, then your conclusions must eventually – or quickly – become out of date. Most float in the mainstream. Many economic models, and especially those currently en vogue in economic theory, suffer from excessive use of mathematical techniques. Young researchers make their models complicated to impress a prospective employer and to get the paper published in a respected journal. Joe Earle, Cahal Moran, and Zach Ward Perkins in The Econocracy report that their lecturers did not mention the biggest economic catastrophe of our times; the recession that started a decade ago. What they were taught had no relevance to people’s lives. Students were memorizing and regurgitating abstract economic models for multiple choice questions.

Other academics have some jargon for that (naturally): “cognitive capture.” During the financial crisis, cognition staged a jail break. Economists from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and elsewhere started looking at “inefficiency.”2 We’ll see if cognition gets put back in its cage soon; looking at class influence requires so much chutzpah. Within economia, the thinking is screwy enough that even conventional economists feel they must speak up. Over time, economists themselves repeatedly fault their field. Throughout his career, the World Bank’s Paul Romer made a habit of critiquing the credibility of macroeconomic models of his peers, irritating many of them (Ch 16). The gatekeepers of knowledge appear impregnable. Yet, just when it seems that the silencers have won, students revolt. Economic students, academics, and professionals who hope to change business-as-usual within economia have gathered under the banner of Rethinking Economics. It’s a hopeful sign, but it’s also like a periodic rash. The previous generation had their post-autistic economics. And before them, there were other critics calling for a fresh start. Economists are unusual, but not unique, in their frequency of scoring low in altruism. Adam Grant, in “Does Studying Economics Breed Greed?”, notes that even thinking about economics can make us less compassionate. Along with directly learning about self-interest in the classroom, because selfish people are attracted to economics, students end up surrounded by people who believe in and act on the principle of self-interest. Extensive research shows that when people gather in groups, they develop even more extreme beliefs than where they started. Mob psychology. By spending time with like-minded people, economics students may become convinced that selfishness is widespread and rational – or at least that charitable giving is rare and foolish. Rather than confront the powerful hierarchy, most economists bow to privilege and sacrifice the scientific method. Still, they boast of being neutral. So, standing by at the evisceration of their field and looking the other way is neutral? Really? Are they neutral or in a state of denial? If not something far less flattering. Actually, I feel a little sad for the ones who adhere to the catechism. But, at least the pay is good. Still, are we being harsh? What if your accountant did not do the best job possible?

An early practitioner, Thomas Malthus, called his field “the dismal science.” Yet only half of that is true; the science part is a polite exaggeration. Their beliefs are more like superstition. I don’t mean to be harsh, but what else can cold, impartial logic lead one to think? Economics is really just a discipline. And its disciples are not full of much useful advice. Rather, they are full of contradictory advice. So, society loses needed guidance. Peer-review pressures economists to conform. When Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard prof, later a presidential advisor on economics, published a paper predicting the last recession, his colleagues roasted him. Instead of praising his attempt to be scientific (he cited the 18-year period in detailed demographics) other highly credentialed voices upbraided him. Not even the guys at the top can escape criticism when they actually try to do their job. Prof. Bill Black, the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One, says “economists are unique among scientists [sic] in the frequency, severity, and persistence of their errors. No other field has such a disastrous series of predictive failures in modern times. No other field gives Nobel [sic] awards to economists for preaching critical policy issues and predictions that have proved dead wrong. Yet conventional economists claim that they should be judged on the basis of their predictive success.” In an article by Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism, 16 May 2016. The Farmer’s Almanac does a better job forecasting the weather. Astrology puts economics to shame, joked John Kenneth Galbraith, the world’s best six-foot-seven economist and President Kennedy’s Economic Advisor. Two other guys who together, back in the 1990s, won that ersatz “Nobel” nearly brought the global financial house down by persuading the rich and powerful to invest in their hedge fund that went belly up. The rare economist does find some predictive power; “residential investment leads the business cycle whereas non-residential investment lags.” That’s by Morris Davis (Georgetown University) and Jonathan Heathcote (Federal Reserve Board) in “Housing and the Business Cycle” (Ch 13). They even mention land and acknowledge it’s absent from NIPA or GDP, so they whittled it down to 20% of the price of housing. For academia-nomics, at least that’s something. Are we finding too much fault? We’re not. The key to forecasting accurately is not a secret, but it is ignored.

Are we finding too much fault? We’re not. The key to forecasting accurately is not a secret, but it is ignored. Leaving out rent, most professionals miss that this cycle occurs with depressing (pardon the pun) regularity, making prediction possible. Geonomists see that, much to their advantage. Rents are vastly superior tea leaves, as you’ll see. I and is out of sight, sut of mind. Even most above-average people still don’t get it. The brain’s hardwiring leaves nearly everyone ill-attuned to the worth of Earth in America. Nearly everybody assumes land value is like any other value that we seek when buying or surrender when selling. We don’t realize that it comes not from anything the seller has done but from what society has done – densify population – and what nature has done, like provide a great view. We’re in denial that natural rent is money for nothing. Statisticians don’t tell us how much we spend on the nature we use. What economists do tell us about the biggest stream in the economy is unfocused, confounding forecasters and optimists. We can’t tell how good we have it. Those who get rent can … then pull up the ladder, focusing attention elsewhere. Critics and reformers busy themselves fighting their own small-picture battles. A blind spot of another species that leaves me dumbfounded is the one afflicting those lizards who live on the cliffs in Chile overlooking the Pacific Ocean. They fight among themselves for the best locations to build a nest, but don’t fight against seagulls when the birds come to eat the lizards’ eggs. The parents sit there and watch placidly, clueless as to what the devouring of their eggs means. The practical-minded turned land into real estate, the idealists into environment. Watching land disappear makes a gadfly feel invisible and a little sad. Being so relentlessly inquisitive cuts the quester off from the rest of humanity. Such is the life of scouts on the cutting edge, those who explore the wilderness that nearly no one else is interested in yet. It’s a lonely pursuit without much in the way of real-time rewards. Most economists declare land to be “irrelevant today” and a theory of rent “simplistic.” Yet Ford Foundation professor Dani Rodrik noted we must simplify the world to understand it. Conceive the simplest possible explanation, argued Albert Einstein, an admirer of Henry George. George, the 19th c. economist, land reformer, and author of the classic best-seller Progress and Poverty, based our getting of goods on axioms of human nature.

Rather than curious about rent, economists are incurious about the difference between spending that rewards another’s effort – paying for goods and services – and spending that never does – payments for land and privilege. And, typically, economists treat privilege as a given; as natural law, as immutable as gravity. Those geonomists were successful because they watched the clock – the 18-year land-price cycle. As society spends more for land nobody made, it must spend less for goods and services humans did make, until a recession results about once every generational period. Demographers cite the rise and fall in population growth over the same period. If hidebound economics discipline can’t be fixed, it can be replaced. Like going from astrology to astronomy and from alchemy to chemistry, the next shift of the paradigm could be from economics to geonomics. F.A. Hayek compared the economy to an organism, Troy Camplin to an ecosystem. Actually, observed Herman Daly, formerly of the World Bank, economies are a subset of the ecosystem. All three are getting close to recognizing the economy as the geonomy. Geonomics is the field of study that finds patterns and natural laws in our producing, distributing, consuming, and protecting of goods and services, all interacting as an organic system that “inhales and exhales.” Since economists won’t, geonomists do admit who does the work and who gets the wealth. Since economics won’t, geonomics must answer how economies function, why regularly they fail, and what must change to fix that. While the status quo might relax – and even celebrate – re nearly everyone’s out-of- touch-ness, I’m feeling a tad sad for the economists who’re presently denied the chance to become experts and scientists. Their physics envy shows they long to become real scientists. If geonomics does supplant economics, many academics might be happy to have the long nightmare of crippling the study be over. Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientific Revolution showed that funpline but from without. What lies outside mainstream economics that could upset the current apple cart? Geonomists? Perhaps a new generation? Kuhn explained old minds don’t change, only young ones are open to bigger picture explanations. An economist is someone who didn’t have enough personality to become an accountant.

Certainly, some of them would lend their help to push Leviathan to measure our spending for the land and resources we use. And maybe just in time, if money for nothing is a major driver behind our widening inequality, despoliation of the environment, politically-charged non-solutions, and widespread resignation and fatalism. Whether we’re on a tipping point or not, glimpsing a way out of our economic morass is a glimpse worth having. Eh? Many scientists say certain problems will reach their tipping points within our lifetimes. Humanity meeting its needs has cer epidemic, obesity, unaffordable healthcare, unaffordable housing, exhaustion of the employed, low self-worth for the under-employed, disappearing jobs, income lagging behind inflation, indebted governments and college grads, endless wars for resources – not to mention awful daytime television (still – and it’s prime time). You can easily add to the list. Seeing these as crises has kicked millions of people into gear. They want to save the world and save it now. However, they’re going about it like a wild goose chase, with little recognition of any underlying cause. Focused on their surface solution to their chosen problem, they’ve not peeled the onion. Their vision has not penetrated to the fundamental flaw. Yet when many things go wrong, they typically have one root cause, noted Henry George long ago. Thanks to locations acting like geysers, a few lucky owners, lenders, and investors reap extra profit without adding extra value. As profiteers go about capturing those rents, they create problems downstream. Publicizing a figure for rent highlights this casual connection. Hence reformers would welcome the statistic (Ch 4), and, before their issue worsens. There is one issue that is totally indifferent to anyone’s political bechange gets the publicity and may merit it, but global baking is actually one assault among many.

Farm runoffs and discarded medicines poison the water table. The toxins intentionally lathered upon cultivated food, acid rain, plastics and other garbage choke the oceans, devastating fisheries and the production of oxygen. Some power plants and weapons tests add to background radiation which mutates living cells. Modern economies pollute merely as a byproduct but pollute profusely; already two of five will get cancer and the rate keeps rising. Modern economies deplete in step with population growth; of course development gobbles farmland, construction destroys forests, factory farming erodes topsoil and expands deserts; those three developments together endanger species and drive essential links in the food chain into extinction. Future hunger looms over the shoulder of modern obesity. Environmental pollution – from filthy air to contaminated water – is killing more people every year than all war and disease in the world. More than smoking, hunger, or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. The number of people killed by pollution is undoubtedly higher and will be better quantified once more research is done (same story for the worth of Earth). So long as humans profit, whether using or abusing land, the health of the planet must worsen. Singly or together, these environmental issues are closing in on their tipping points, putting civilization on the brink of e-collapse. Afterwards, you would not want to be anywhere near the surface of the Earth. While they call it a “housing crisis,” that’s superficial observation. It’s actually a location, location, location crisis. Housing ages and wears out; it depreciates. It’s the land underneath that appreciates. What newcomers to enticing areas will pay dearly for is less the building, more the climate (California) and/or culture (Portland). You can blame techno-progress, giving raises to its workers, endowing them with the wherewithal to bid up homes on desirable sites. Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel explained, “the vast majority of the capital I give to the companies in Silicon Valley is just going to landlords. It’s going to commercial real estate and even more to urban slumlords of one sort or another.” Those who flee spendy regions create a ripple effect, making other places unaffordable for residents there.

Hot spots like the coastal cities radiate rent that warms up formerly cool spots. People called the last major downturn a crisis, a Great Recession, forsion. The Kondratieff Wave could be a factor, but definitely the bailout. Last recession, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve created $30 trillion by issuing it. Big banks and big business, domestic and foreign, used it to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate. They bid up their price beyond their value, exposing asset owners to bankruptcy besides putting assets out of reach of most people. As long as speculators bid up the price of land beyond what most can afford, the US economy must recede on a regular basis. As people spend more for never-produced land, they spend less for the goods and services their neighbors produce. As producers sell less, they hire less. After a while they must fire people. In the words of three academics writing for the Federal Reserve, “in the Great Recession … the collapse in the housing market was followed by a sharp rise of unemployment.” And the unemployed don’t make the best of consumers. Nearly the entire economy recedes. The recession lasts until loan defaults knock land costs back down again (for a while). Many people accept hard times as natural events, like droughts, which human ingenuity cannot deter. Of course, various thinkers have proposed various solutions, mainly focused on banks. However, for a solution to succeed it must address both kinds of spending, the one that rewards production versus the one that rewards rent-seeking. Attend to that sine qua non, then the business cycle will no longer boom and bust but climb and glide. Per capita, US public debt is currently (updated regularly) $62,000. unloading dollars abroad. Further, nations with high inflation hold many US dollars in reserve; places like Ecuador even use it for their national currency. With those two escape valves, the Federal Reserve’s over-issuing of new dollars inflates domestic prices by “only” 3% (officially). That still doubles prices in 25-30 years. However, it’s too slow for most people to notice. The frog in the saucepan on the stove. Meanwhile, the private debt of citizens is also enormous.

Now it’s student debt – $1.5 trillion; while current law allows governments to declare bankruptcy, it prevents students from doing the same. Facing few well-paying jobs, future generations could stay in serious debt their entire lifetimes. Lifelong debt must make it look like older generations pulled up the ladder. The third big bookkeeping category, corporations, is also a swamp of debt – $29t (just coincidentally, the same amount as the Fed’s _(08 − 09) bailouts). Often, they borrow to grow, pay it back, and write off the interest payments. (Did bankers have a hand in lobbying for that loophole, too?) Without that money-saving write-off, businesses would borrow less, and the overall economy would not be saddled with so much debt. During recessions, people demand help from government, but can’t pay as many taxes. So, governments sink even deeper into debt. At some point, just as Detroit did, the US must go bankrupt. To pay its debt it will devalue the dollar relative to other currencies, just as the UK did with the pound. Then others will abandon the dollar, flooding the US with its own money, driving inflation out of sight. W hile economies can’t help but create a surplus society-wide, en-closing that abundance creates a dearth in some pockets. The few who collect rent use it in ways that constrict supply and exacerbate demand. They buy up (thus bid up) assets and under-utilize prime sites. With higher prices and lower wages, many people cannot afford to own large assets, such as a home. Homeownership has fallen and stock ownership was never a majority pastime. Both behaviors drain away the wealth of the majority, making them more vulnerable. It widens the wealth and income gaps, which slows real economic growth, and increases poverty. U.S. income inequality, on rise for decades, is now highest since 1928. The abyss of inequality – it’s unimaginable. A few get so much that they could not spend it all in several lifetimes of ultra-luxurious living. And their locations rise in value faster than elsewhere occupied by non-rich. Meanwhile, others barely scrape by on the leftover scraps. Beyond the purely material dimension, concentrating so much wealth and income in the hands of so few is bad for everyone in many ways. Even people who aren’t poor feel like losers. Wildly unequal societies are less happy than more equal ones.

The more disconnected from others one feels, the less one cares about others, and feels comfortable committing all sorts of anti-social behaviors. The current occupant of the White House may be an outlier, but most of the 1% share his egocentric aloofness. The insensitivity of the privileged crosses party lines. While conservatives might oppose safety for employees at work, liberals might not hear the poor oppose public housing because they, the poor, don’t want their offspring trapped in it, generation after generation. Expect the next recession to create more losers and winners, further shrinking the anxious middle class, expanding the lower class, while making the upper class more aloof. Then America stops being a predominantly middle-class society. That means losing its democracy, losing its environmental movement, losing its rapprochement between the classes. Perhaps it’s the nature of democracies to devolve back into aristocracies in a feudal society. How many recessions away is America from morphing into something even more like George Orwell’s 1984? It’s ironic, happening now – as other big nations are growing their middle class: China, India, Russia, Brazil. Just give those trends enough time – ours shrinking, theirs expanding. (“The American Middle-Class is No longer the World’s Richest” by David Leonhardt and Kevin Quealy in the New York Times, 22 April 2014). Nowadays, even middle-class residents spend over half their income on housing (that sits on desirable sites). In most US cities, downtowns are pockmarked by vacant lots that, if developed, could hire hundreds of workers. And in Louisiana and other cancer alleys, pollution greatly suppresses land value. How much worse can it get? How much more can the tattered social contract tolerate? How much more can the ravaged global ecosystem endure? While such trends seem to move at a glacial pace from the perspective of the individual, when they reach their tipping point, the collapse comes quick – as did the USSR. By then it will be way too late to take the relatively easier steps of prevention versus the arduous steps of curing catastrophe. Wannabe reformers have much bigger fish to fry than tallying rent. And boy, are those fish ever getting fried! Like generals believing they know how to win the last war, the left tries to rein in business, the right tries to rein in government. “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.” – supposedly Einstein, an admirer of proto-genomics – but more likely from a 12-Step Program.

Environmental organizations, trying to stave off eco-lapse, are not necessarily stuck in that old Industrial Era conflict of boss versus worker. Yet, most act like economists in keeping “neutral.” Property is so controversial that they don’t touch it. Further, many environmentalists are already homeowners, which is to say beneficiaries of site values going bonkers. Overlooking the linkage between Earth’s worth and Earth’s health is in their self-interest, too. They, too, turn a blind eye to the link of reward-to-ruin – the role of rent in driving eco-ploitation – and confine themselves to “just say no” to despoliation. People interested in new ideas and old problems try to solve these problems without addressing the basic motive – possessing rents. You can see how that’s worked out. So, who’s really rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic? We gadflies or wannabe saviors who studiously ignore the worth of Earth in America? If our business-as-usual is to be altered in planet-saving ways, and in time, a critical mass must become cognizant of the real role of rent. Nobody should ever have to apologize for their curiosity, yet some in the discipline question our quest. They bring up objectivity and impartiality, like people in glass houses hurling stones. Their stifling behavior is maddening; it’s what Melville’s Billy Budd felt, being mute, unable to be heard. Eventually it drove him insane. Fortunately, the road to that sad outcome is blocked to us by you, our dear reader. If someone did the hard work, perhaps a solid stat for all of society’s spending for nature and privilege could motivate a critical mass of researchers to upgrade, to geonomics. Such things happen in the realm of science; eventually, Leviathan can be turned. The old beliefs that generate psychological dissonance no longer comfort the mind. Overcome resistance to the new paradigm and the once-ridiculous becomes mainstream. Most new ideas begin as heresy. W hile our problems are dire, our activists flail about blindly. If ever they are to solve chronic and pressing problems, agents of change have to see the big picture. Part of that picture is rent, the surplus that an economy naturally and unavoidably cranks out. Who that stream rewards, and what they do to capture it, shapes the world. Environmentalists, for example, want our species to befriend Mother Earth.

Yet it’s not rational of them to let land be such a fat profit-maker and expect a law that “just-says-no” to development to succeed. Ordinary citizens are moved by the bottom line, so the planet needs profit on its side. Then, even if for no other reason but to save money, most would spare ecosystems. A figure for how much we spend on the nature we use helps other problem solvers better see how economies operate and when they don’t, what to do differently. Then we could adopt policies that redirect rent so it’d no longer reward waste but only efficiency. Again, the public would save and befriend reform. edge to good use. President Theodore Roosevelt not only endorsed the public recovery of land values (a little historical footnote), the “Roughrider” also inspired his readers: “It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.” And when the going gets tough, the tenacious gadflies get going. Recall Bertrand Russell’s conjugation: “I am stalwart. You are stubborn. He, she, or it is pigheaded.” You can see where they slide me in, and where I place myself. Philosopher Lord Russell, the person who scored the highest ever on math in the entrance exam to Cambridge without ever previously going to school, eclipsed Teddy by proposing that government pay the citizenry dividends from the recovered rents of sites and resources (another historical factoid). Once you know that rent rules, how can anyone let go of this quest? The few who grasp that our spending for land and resources creates problems now, perhaps solutions later, are the ones who must press forward and drill all the way down to the most serviceable number for the size of all rents. We’ll see this through to the end. Go over the heads of the data-keepers. Issue a rallying cry. Intertwine counters and demanders. Determination feels so much better than despair. f on my watch things worsen drastically for humanity, it won’t be be-Icause I failed my responsibility to make rent knowable. Once we make an intriguing figure available, we’ll have laid the groundwork for specialists to refine it. We’d have an authoritative statistic for all spending for all kinds of land and privilege. Some open-minded agents of change are curious to know how much society spends on the land and resources it uses.

Even if no deep-pocket person or foundation steps up, in this e-era of sites like Kickstarter, money may no longer be an obstacle. A few on the cutting edge of economics may soon address basic sta-tistics, on both the demand side and the supply side. New outfits have sprung up capable of ferreting out a figure for the worth of Earth in America. Plus, some new organizations may demand a grand total of the value of land, resources, and privileges. So, what if the Bigs have not yet come through. These Littles could fill the breach. Not that we should give up on the Bigs, even though the official sources of statistics have not made basic research any easier, and the entrepreneurial sources have not made their statistics any cheaper. But at both places their personnel is constantly changing, so their degree of cooperation is constantly in flux. Perhaps some competition from the Littles may nudge them in the right direction. The few big-name economists who criticize official statistics and demand better numbers are not alone (Ch 17). To meet the need for accuracy and relevance, already, lesser known, specialized organizations churn out stats and make the data available to inquiring minds. Given their self-described willingness to think outside the box, might such entities calculate the economic surplus which the presence of society generates? 5. The Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG) is an independent research and media organization. The Centre acts as a think tank on crucial economic and geopolitical issues. Its articles, commentary, background research and analysis focus on social, economic, strategic, and environmental issues. 7. Shadow Government Statistics (“Shadow Stats”) by John Williams offers analysis behind and beyond government economic reporting. Despite Williams coming from the mainstream, there are an awful lot of mainstream articles criticizing him. That actually could signify that he’s telling the harsh truth that the powers-thatbe don’t want the public to hear. May he go broad and deep and tackle the worth of Earth. 8.

Who Rules America? (1967, Ch 12) was loaded with statistics and described the local growth machines of real estate development. All these outfits (except the next) are open-minded enough to go beyond the official numbers. Nine of them raise the expectations of curious geonomists, number 3 especially. Of them all, the best known is the least bold – #10 (coming up). You know all the oddities you find in statistics (usually negatives, like plane crashes or suicides bunching together)? There’s money to be made citing those. 10.Freakonomics was launched by Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt. They’re academics, like Dr. Domhoff, but despite the great name, the “freakonomists” stick to the mainstream, unlike Bill Domhoff. Their “-omics” began as an article, then a book, then morphed into a documentary film, a Jon Stewart show appearance, and an NPR radio show. Freakonomics.com has been called “the most readable economics blog in the universe” (which, the Steves admit, isn’t really saying much). In 2014, Levitt and Dubner published their third book, Think Like a Freak – supposedly a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems. However, they use official statistics with blind faith. Like the rest of academia, they call their numbers “data” (though it’s nothing like the accurate and relevant measurements in hard science). Dubner and Levitt focus on funny things people do – like When to Rob a Bank. These little-picture oddities – not how economies work and don’t – they call that economics. Their legion of followers, who number in the millions, also think fun-with-numbers is real economics. Give the Steves their due for making economics entertaining and enlightening, even if less relevant. All the probing into the unusual by the Freaks has, so far, kept them clear of the rent factor. Limiting “economics” to the incidental, while eschewing big-picture analysis of an economy’s actual workings and its resultant wealth, does the discipline no favors. Their analyses elevate what’s merely entertainment, distracting the public, and trivializing what the public should know, cementing their institutionalized indifference to deeper analysis. Maybe another source is the fact-checkers. Nowadays, some Internet divers (not surfers), organizations, and newspapers pride themselves on testing official numbers for veracity.

Perhaps it’s self-serving – they wish to stabilize the system that put them so high above everybody else, since yawning disparity de-stabilizes the social order. Or maybe it’s merely an embarrassment of riches. Or those elite are being charitable out of the goodness of their hearts; philanthropy is a normal human trait. Whatever the motive, it’s exciting to know that people with the power to make change are advocating change. Some even advocate fixing or replacing GDP to measure an economy’s success; a figure for rent could make a great replacement statistic, updatable daily. Rather than share just any kind of wealth, maybe these elite would warm up to sharing rent, once they hear how society generates it and how much it is – enough, if shared, to make a real difference. Rent is the kind of wealth that’s less a product of individual effort and more a result of social progress and natural advantages. By tapping sites, resources, and privileges, we can avoid taxing the successes of useful producers, and thereby not diminish the incentive to produce. Second, some of the faithful talk up land issues that cause suffering: concentration of land ownership, homelessness, unaffordable housing, pollution, etc. Many recent Roman Catholic Popes have urged followers to reform land holdings and to quit contaminating the earth. The Catholic Worker Movement in the US and Oxfam in the UK might lend their voices to a chorus calling for officials to measure the Bible’s “fruit of the earth,” which belongs to all. Fourth, youth is a time when humans tend to be more open to new ways to see the world. Inexperienced. Ahistorical. Impatient. Idealistic. And lacking an intellectual lineage they’re deeply emotionally attached to. Note that it’s grad students who criticize economics. And youthful activists who latch on to cutting-edge causes. With the youth wing of monetarists, religions, and wealthy families leading the way, demanding answers, then suppliers of measurements would come up with a good, useful number.

For academics, always in need of young blood, it must feel odd to regard the coming generation as a potentially disruptive force. Some professors would not want to be out of step with their students. Those youngat-heart profs would sniff around the issue of rent and echo the call for a serviceable number for the value of land and resources. Once a critical mass of economists requests decent measurements of spending on assets never produced, then the bureaucratic part of government would raise their bar. Once enough reformers demand to know the size of social surplus, then the legal system itself would push up the bar. The data-minders would make their statistics as accurate and relevant as possible. You may want to ask any of these organizations for a reliable figure for the rental value of all land and resources in the US or UK. Your question could add to earlier ones, putting those interrogated at a tipping point, where they will take on the challenge of digging deeper. Or you may find by then they’ll have come up with an answer and you’ll be one of the first to learn it. The past successes of the above interest groups give one grounds for believing that a gadfly can win. Such groups have expanded their horizons before and can do so again. Once cognizant that our spending for things never produced is a social surplus, probably they’d seek to know not just its size but also the identity of its recipients. ountrysides are where the fewest people own the most land for the least money. Some billionaires in the wide-open West own spreads the size of small East Coast states. Their holdings make for an incredible overall concentration. The USDA figures 3% (not a typo) of Americans own 95% of the privately held land (“Land Rush” by Peter Meyer in Harper’s, January 1979). That’s a far cry from the ideal of proto-geonomist Thomas Jefferson, who thought America should be a nation of small farmers. Other ranchers would like to own more and set their sights on public lands. Some have christened themselves the Sagebrush Rebellion. Opposing them are the democrats (lower case – those who favor group participation in decisions), who resist losing public property, even if they’re unaware of the public nature of rent.

By making their claims strident, they make tallying the worth of Earth in America awkward. Not just because the claimants are rich and powerful; they also have the myth of rugged individualism – now a customary defense mechanism – on their side. While militating against paying the public for their land, sagebrush rebels and other rural corporations are not shy about taking public dollars. Agri-business gets most of the federal billions, but also lining the trough are ranchers, loggers, and miners. States and localities also chip in in their own way, with roads and tax breaks. Cities are where opposition to landlords is most strident, given unaffordable housing and gentrification. Many of those who hang on to their apartments demand rent control. Aspen, Colorado-ites won a tiny land tax to fund public housing. Less conventional people are resettling in land trusts, more every year. While proclaiming their exclusive right (actually, privilege; rights are inclusive) to own any and all, land grabbers reject any requirement to be good stewards. Their straw-villain is the environmental movement. Now that many citizens, mostly city dwellers, want to protect the environment are these “allodials” (owners owing nothing) bitter. The propertarians picked a winnable fight. As audacious are the allodials about taking over the earth, that’s how timid environmentalists are about sharing the earth or her worth. Since most of the latter are home(site)owners in metro America, they too benefit from the current system inflating site values. The more extreme rentiers agitate to abolish all public property and individuals owns the roads, national monuments, beaches, et al. Sidewalks would be gated – if any were to remain and not be ceded to automobiles. Ultimately, would the 1% own the rivers? The lakes? The atmosphere? All are for sale. Some of those who have benefited the most from what civilization has to offer oppose not just commons but society itself. During the 1980s a certain politician across the pond claimed, “there is no society” (may she RIP). On this side of the Atlantic, a TV actor/politician (may he RIP) argued government is a problem, not a solution. Not surprisingly, victims of such abuse find appealing the ideas of shrinking and privatizing the role of bureaucrats and politicians in their lives.

Using their conventional definitions and methods, not corrected by reason or deep analysis, then what would a total for the worth of Earth in America look like? Academics and statisticians tend to lowball the value of land and resources (Ch 18). They come across not as partial to the truth, but partial to a special interest; for them, a high estimate is high risk. So, let me reprogram myself to not just appear impartial but go one better and appear anti-partial. Forget logic. We’ll lowball, too, and see what that total of all rents looks like. Sigh. Surrendering to convention feels like throwing a robe on a classical nude sculpture – dressing up a figure for the worth of Earth in America in pseudo-respectability. Yet it may be easier for a science popularizer to propagate a total that’s pseudo-official, no matter how far off market value it’d be. We twist the campaigner’s saying to yield, ^(′′)I don’t care how much the total becomes as long as you spell socially-generated value right.” Was it Gandhi, who said everyone has a piece of the truth? Economists, however, have pieces of the truth. Rather than tabulate a grand total for our spending that never rewards anyone’s labor or capital (nobody-made land), they’ve measured parts of the whole, like residential land (Ch 13) or parkland (Ch 15). Not finding an official total, we sought, instead, an accurate total. That meant we questers had to question the statistics and methods that experts used. Normally, questioning implies criticism, and who enjoys being criticized? The experts have not exactly been effusive with their praise, toasts, and calls to celebrate this quest to know the total of all rents (Ch 19). If you can’t beat them, bury them – beneath opaque jargon and a thicket of insignificant statistics; that seems to be the motto of many specialists (Ch 17). Our contrary modus operandi was to dig up the numbers that most fully represent surplus – the worth of never produced sites and resources. Yet any gain in accuracy has a cost – a loss in credibility within mainstream minds. Our conciliatory motto is the more familiar, “If you can’t beat them, join them.” That is, base our extended quest on where officials left off. Now, what we lose in accuracy may mean a gain in acceptability.

Now, what we lose in accuracy may mean a gain in acceptability. A total born of their own assumptions may placate the specialists. This exercise could win friends and influence people toiling away in academia or in a relevant bureaucracy. They may become more forthcoming with their assistance and feedback. They may even take on a pride of ownership. Pragmatists put public acceptance above letting one’s light languish beneath a bushel basket. Idealists, of course, put accuracy above accommodating those who don’t prize truth. Our curiosity resolves the dilemma. Exactly how far apart are the two totals – the one catering to convention versus the one employing informed logic? Let’s see. • The latest mean for housing is $203k per house in America. That’s by Case & Shiller, academics cited by government and media. Or, it’s $218k , according to Zillow, a company that serves homebuyers and businesses involved mainly in building houses. Multiply that $15k difference by 83,000,000 homes (Census Bureau stat), you get $1.2t . While specialists might be comfortable with a difference of a trillion here, a trillion there, anyone seeking a reliable total for land value must keep looking. • Figures for housing hint toward a figure for land. For residential land we have academic Lincoln who, for the start of 2016, put it at both $8.7 trillion (FHFA) and $90tr (Case & Shiller again). Both totals cannot be right. Indeed, both can be wrong. The difference is $1.2t (again). That much money could provide a comfy income for one-fifth of all US households. Such disparity makes one wonder if all conventional figures are wrong. Almost all give more weight to buildings, which depreciate, than to locations, which during most of the business cycle appreciate. Nevertheless, both figures can serve as a minimum for all land price. • The only academic figure for land based only on land sales (not sales of location and structure together) is Albouy’s, for metro land. His 2009 total was $18t . To extrapolate a figure for 2016 (Lincoln’s latest), use the FHFA stats at Lincoln; the percentage increase in land value from 2009 to 2016 is 33% . So Albouy’s 2016 total comes to $24t , only for urban land. • To add the value of nature’s electro-magnetic spectrum (that we use for modern communication), it was at least a half-trillion in 2007¹ and certainly more a decade later, bringing the total to over $30t . That amount was reached in 2006 before the bubble burst, and supposedly land values had already recovered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634242998_cleaned.txt:101:31341da7c9b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1150, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634242998_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634242998", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634242998_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "at Lincoln; the percentage increase in land value from 2009 to 2016 is 33% .

That amount was reached in 2006 before the bubble burst, and supposedly land values had already recovered a few years back, so $30+ tr likely underestimates the actual total. Is that $1.5t credible? It’s less than one tenth of national spending (or income or GDP). Consider the value of locations in popular cities. Consider the commercial value of downtown sites. Consider the spending on oil from domestic fields, on owning frequencies in the EM spectrum. Consider imputed environmental values. From such a bigger-picture POV, no way can the rental value of nature in use be $1.5t . Indeed, the totals that geonomists came up with, from $4 to $6t , are far less partial, much more logically derived, and hence far more likely to be accurate (Ch 20). Yet for the present, precision is not our goal; acceptance is. Can mainstreamers live with this paltry figure? Astronomer Carl Sagan’s book, later a film, Contact, got NASA to finally fund SETI. (signals from outer space are also ignored, just like sightings of land value, so the chapters of this book are in good, celestial company). If it becomes as successful as Sagan’s, this book (maybe later a documentary), could get agencies and foundations to fund the determining of a new indicator – the worth of Earth in America. Some well-connected companies - self-described experts at tabulating – do sell measurements. They claim the ability to calculate whatever feature of an economy or demography that a buyer could want. So, that includes figuring out the value of land and resources? And provides a total more precise than our current ballpark figure? Firms like Case-Shiller, CoStar, and Statista suit the needs of the mainstream. Case-Shiller are cited all through the business press, CoStar sells to the Federal Reserve, and Statista draws from over 20,000 sources. These three offer to sell the total value of US residential real estate, and property values in general – more than we want. With their resources, they may also be able to determine just the wellcloaked land portion of real estate. And they may be able to tack on the value of land used for purposes other than residential or commercial or industrial: i.e., agricultural, pastural, sylvan, mineral, and spectral (the airwaves), and other resources, such as water. Asking them to figure in the value of anything else natural may be asking too much.

Asking them to figure in the value of anything else natural may be asking too much. Even the generous who’re interested in economics, like most everyone, have a hard time seeing the relevance of rent. One spending stream can’t be that significant, can it? What’s the big deal about rewarding producers of goods and services, versus rewarding owners of never-produced land and resources? Not much. Unless you want to forecast, assess your surplus, and project the gains from healing land. ↶ iven the millions of human minds and the diversity of human in-Gterests, some individuals and foundations do get it; those are the geonomic (Earth-focused economics) ones. The activist group Common Ground USA, comes to mind, as do two New York-based foundations: Henry George School and the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation. Even this writer has on occasion been funded by them to research rents. Fortunately, some humans are curious enough about the true worth of Earth to give money to a stranger to find it out. A critical mass wants to know how much they and all their fellow citizens spend to own or use a location, or natural resource or government-granted privilege. Plus, they could claim credit for launching a new and better indicator; and for making it safe for funders and researchers to climb aboard the rent train. Money in hand, one could hire the pro statistician. Yet, needing to turn to a for-profit corporation raises the question: why should taxpayers be funding the responsible public agency? Why spend taxes on those huge staffs in public agencies just so they can pay huge staffs in private agencies? If a public agency won’t perform its fiscal duty, why not abolish it and save the public money? An agency fulfilling its mandate – is that something to lobby for? ry as hard as academics and bureaucrats might, it’s nigh impossible to do economics without getting politics all over you. If you find that competition accomplishes some goal equitably, the gal lery calls you a rightist. If you find that cooperation accomplishes some goal efficiently, your detractors call you a leftist. Comes with the territory. While economists try to steer clear of politics, political people grab their favorite economic policy and charge up the hill with it. Which could work out for us gadflies. Some of those political people have influence and may help us sway officialdom to calculate the worth of Earth in America. They’d do that because such a statistic would help them advance their own agenda. Remember those issues at their tipping point (Ch 29)?

Buying land or anything with land in it, we reward owners, some of whom chew up the environment and spew out pollutants. Rather than continue to enrich those who waste resources or leave behind waste, society could make them pay. To avoid paying an extra expense, producers and investors would switch from foul, inefficient ways of providing a good or service to clean, efficient ways. Businesses and residents would reduce their depletion and pollution, too. Just in time, governments may make polluters and depleters pay. Government could collect Ecology Security Deposits, require Restoration Insurance, auction off Emission Permits, penalize violators of standards with realistic fines, etc. To charge any of these, government must first know the market value of affected regions and surrounding regions. That’s our cue. Another policy that benefits the environment is one some jurisdictions use in order to raise revenue efficiently. They shift the property tax from buildings to land. To pay the land levy, owners of prime vacant lots put them to good use. Then downtown absorbs new building, leaving little or no construction to sprawl over the countryside (Ch 39). Before more localities levy land, they’d like to know its yield. Environmentalists defend hillsides, creek banks, and marshes and argue for zoning and other regulations. However, the only current way to profit from land is to develop it. An alternative way could both reward the owner and spare the land. That is, government could gather up the annual rental value in its jurisdiction and pay residents a share. Receiving their portion, owners prevented from developing their land would be compensated financially, and get to live in a vigorous environment. A region with parks, open space, and wildlife corridors has higher value than one with wall-to-wall development.1 So does a region that humans have cleaned up. The cleaner the environment, the more valuable the locations,2 and then the bigger the share.

The cleaner the environment, the more valuable the locations,2 and then the bigger the share. Residents have less motive to exploit their land in any way that’d lower its value and their share of rents. Talk about a positive reinforcing feedback loop. Developers cannot profit by putting low-cost housing on exorbitant sites, parcels that carry high property taxes. Residents respond with requirements to build affordable housing, tax breaks for developers, tax caps, etc. Ironically, the effort to pay less to government means paying more to sellers. Speculators simply raise prices, absorbing any tax savings. Look at California after Prop. 13 and the states that followed suit – site costs are out of sight.3 While capping the property tax does not work, shifting the property tax does. Now taxing property penalizes improvers and rewards speculators, but it could be flipped to discourage speculators and reward improvers. Doing that addresses both issues, affordability and livability (Ch 39). To enjoy these benefits, cutting-edge urban advocates support shifting the property tax. Along with taxes, another job-blockage is speculation in land. Some investors and owners make money by not using their land but by waiting to sell (or lease) it at a higher value. Even in Manhattan, where a parcel can make one a fabulous fortune, you see vacant lots, abandoned buildings, and under-utilized locations. What happens on a vacant lot? Nothing, at least in the way of work. Take a bird’s eye view. Where the city is pockmarked by vacant lots – slums – that’s where unemployment is endemic. Those eyesores, when located downtown, displace businesses and residents to less central, less desirable locations. There companies make less money, hire fewer workers, and pay lower wages. And wherever they are, vacant lots attract crime but do not foot their share of the bill for police and fire. These unwanted results of vacant lots, along with the argument that society generates land value, are more reasons to tap rent to benefit society. The IMF (International Monetary Fund) notes that, having to pay some sort of land dues, owners put their vacant lots to good use,4 which requires hiring people. Afterwards, using the new structures requires hiring people, too. Further, where employment rises, so do wages. Furthermore, where wages rise, so does location value. Were it measured, policymakers would know its potential to do good, and job-pushers would be one big step closer to their ideal of full employment.

Modern libertarians claim yesteryear’s classical liberals as their intel-lectual lineage. And even though many libertarians see paying land and receiving a share as a handout akin to a bribe, they are out of step with their roots. Libertarian heroes Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, and Tom Paine, and others all stated that spending for land – our mutual heritage – is something that all members of society would be better off sharing. Along with lionizing past liberals, modern libertarians prefer their governments slender (as do freedom seekers of all eras). The revenue policy of sharing rents can grant their wish. Jurisdictions that recover the rents of land, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, need not tax labor or capital. The jurisdictions that pay rent dividends, such as Alaska paying residents the oil dividend, need not subsidize citizens, whether rich or poor. Presto. Governments regain their youthful figures. Ironically, it was Alaskan Libertarians who won that oil dividend and the libertarian organization the Heritage Foundation that ranks Hong Kong and Singapore as two of the freest places on Earth, while remaining mute about their policy of capturing rents. Most modern libertarians are too anti-government to be aware of the libertarian nature of socialized rents, but not all. Some rich libertarians and libertarian groups are on board, too. Others could join the call. While another world war is not pending, all the smaller wars that the US has confined itself to are troublesome. So are the black budget and the heavily-armed planet. The more a nation knows inequality, the more belligerently it behaves. Conversely, the smaller the prosperity gap between nations and between classes, the more peaceful are the nations. And rent, once counted, could become a bigger pie for society, better divided. Not so much a movement as a discussion group scattered nationwide,are wannabe reformers of economies; a passionate segment focuses on money. Among those, some would abandon the call to return to gold or any precious metal as a backing for newly issued currency. Instead, they’d use the value of land. If that makes sense, then they and their audience might want to know land’s value. There are some businesses who realize that putting prime land to good use attracts investment. After Pittsburgh widened the gap between its half of the property tax on land and its half on buildings, the city renewed its downtown without one penny of subsidy; rather with private investment.

Every place that has implemented it has benefited, in terms of higher wages, slower inflation, greater investment, gentler business cycle, wider spread prosperity, etc. For others to follow suit and take it mainstream, they might like to first know the size of their tax base. Nowadays, even middle-class residents spend over half their income on the housing (that sits on desirable sites). In most US cities, downtowns are pockmarked by vacant lots that, if developed, could hire hundreds of workers. And in Louisiana and other cancer alleys, pollution greatly suppresses land value. In the past these movements—from environmentalists to politicos— have been at cross purposes, which leaves society in a somewhat turbulent state and even the victor feeling a bit uncomfortable. To lose that social dissonance, some advocates in disparate movements welcome the opportunity to work across the aisle with opponents. Perhaps tabulating the natural surplus of our economy could become a mutual goal. The above interest groups have expanded their horizons before and succeeded often. Singly or in a coalition, they could go over the heads of data-keepers, straight to their bosses. The lobbied officeholders would order the public’s number-crunchers to make an accurate accounting of society’s spending on nature and privilege; imagine: an agency fulfilling its mandate. Not just gadflies are stonewalled when trying to squeeze a re-sponse from government; even presidents get stymied. John F. Kennedy expressed amazement upon discovering how little power the President of the United States actually had, how unresponsive bureaucracies were to his executive orders. Perhaps since then, the “highest” office in the land has accrued more power. Of course, bureaucrats did not stonewall every command issued bytheir commander-in-chief. Most often, they obeyed in one fashion or another, even to an order pertinent to our request. Throughout history, bureaucracies have complied with their ruler’s mandate to calculate the worth of Earth in their jurisdiction: in ancient Sumer and Egypt (Foreword) and medieval England (Ch 3). How hard can it be? In Denmark, they used to include the value of the location with each number and address in the phone book. Denmark had a history of assessing and taxing land dating back to the Age of Enlightenment (late 1700s).

Then, a nephew overthrew his uncle, the king, just so he could sit on the throne and tax land for the betterment of the whole kingdom (the idealism of youth). No vestiges remain. The first US Government, in operation during the rebellion against Great Britain, operated according to the first attempt at a constitution, the Articles of Confederation. That document directed the federal government to fund itself with land value collected by a tax. To do so, of course, required government to know, and thus assess, the worth of locations. The Founding Fathers junked their first constitution with its land tax, in favor of the current constitution with free trade between states and tariffs at national borders, plus land sales to fund the federal government. While no longer needing to know the value of locations, that document does nevertheless require Congress to conduct a census every ten years. Today’s census counts many things; not just the number of people but also their incomes and outgoes and possessions. The US Census Bureau even used to add up the value of land in America, but quit doing it. Yet, the US Congress could require that department to get back to tabulating the worth of Earth in America. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Land Management, Census Bureau, CIA (believe it), Congressional Budget Office, Congressional Research Service, Departments of Agriculture, of Commerce, Federal Communications Commission (for the value of the EM spectrum), Federal Housing Administration, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, General Services Administration, Government Accountability Office, Housing and Urban Development, Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics), Library of Congress, Office of Management and Budget, Treasury (Bureau of the Fiscal Service), and two quasi-governmental agencies, the Federal Reserve and the National Bureau of Economic Research. It also requires that the petitioner understands the obtuse text on the agency’s websites on how to use the FOIA (they offer a second website to explain the first one). A citizen can only hope that their request is made according to the bureaucracy’s rules. And that, if any mistake is made, it won’t completely derail the request. In total, 20 + 2 bureaucracies got our own FOIA request; I held my breath. Within days, the letters from the bureaucracies did begin to pour in. Many were form letters, yet many others were unique and original, in order to address my unheard-of request. I was grateful for the time that a busy bureaucrat took to reply. The end results?

But if an agency did have the answer, it could be hard to say so. The powerful insiders who now capture most of the rental stream have subtly mandated government to overlook that fatness, the very existence of King Rent, in order to keep the public in the dark re this source of fortune. Would that explain why some agencies did not reply? Those that did reply said they did not track “rents,” our society’s spending on land, resources, spectrum, etc. Those that did track real estate values said they did not keep separate the value of human-made buildings from the value of nature-made land. Nor did they offer to separate for me the two drastically different values, to make clear our two drastically different spendings – one that rewards human effort (production) and one that rewards social advantage (ownership). f our public bureaucracies don’t have the answer, elected officials can I make them determine it. The infrastructure is in place. Members of the House, the Senate, and the Executive all have their own research service. And when it’s a member of Congress asking for an answer, that bureaucrat feels enough heat to generate some light, however dim. Officeholders might issue such an order if they, in turn, were ordered. Upstream from politicians, a citizen could request their elected representative to require the relevant public agencies to either release a reliable figure for the worth of Earth in America or to get busy and calculate it. That is, if the chain of command in a democracy were to behave as advertised. Given your clout with federal bureaucracies, you could be of immense help to the electorate, ferreting out data. Our sought-after figures tell us what phase the business cycle is in (decades ago Hoyt discovered the 18-year land-price cycle). Good to know if you want to keep your savings or investments safe. Those same statistics also tell us how much surplus our economy is generating. When government does recover “rents” (technically), i.e., puts them in the tax base, landowners use land more efficiently, which generates jobs.

Many voters prefer a more equitable disbursal of our social surplus, rather than let just a tiny fraction of us hog the most. A fair share would finance free time for every citizen. Presently Singapore cuts taxes on efforts, taps into the socially generated value of locations, piles up a revenue surplus, and pays citizens a dividend. How much we spend for nature can be derived from many sources, including mortgages, property taxes paid, certain insurances, assessments, appraisals, for all uses, not just residential, but also commercial, industrial, agricultural, sylvan, mineral, fossil fuels, the EM spectrum, and not just private land but also nonprofit and public land, including roadways and water. We’re talking trillions here, so we really need to know this stat. Asking officer holders difficult questions runs into the same obstacles as asking bureaucrats. The politicians, or their staff person who handles incoming mail, may have a radically different worldview. They don’t see what the big deal is about knowing the size of all rents. Plus, like almost everybody else, they’re busy. Even though elected public officials are often about as helpful as the unelected public officials, politicians are here to serve us. Sometimes they do. They are cautious, they are weathervanes. One thing all politicians do is count noses. They won’t build a bandwagon; but will hop on one with enough voters onboard. The greater number of people who want to know, the happier politicians are to help. They’re human and humans like to be on the winning side. When an election is coming up, incumbent candidates are especially helpful. Instead of sending a letter that might fetch a form reply, gadflies could make an outing of it. Assemble a crew and pay a visit to their Congressperson; even recruit an academic expert to join in petitioning Congress. In person, they could all insist that public agencies measure the socially generated value of locations and make that knowledge public. Present a sample letter the elected official could use. Even then, after fielding a request from a Congressperson, bureaucrats might stall, as they did with JFK. Words-on-paper are one thing; adherence to those words is something else altogether.

Even if the venture is not immediately successful, at least it will plant seeds that will bear fruit in ways one cannot expect. As in the country-western song, researchers have been looking for a tally in all the wrong places. Statisticians have sought a figure for the worth of Earth in America by looking at sale prices, not at rental leases. Compounding their problem, most economists (except Albouy, Ch 13) looked at property, not at land alone. Why? The media, too, ignore rent, focusing on price. When the price of housing goes up, the media tell us that is good news, while forgetting to point out that actually, it’s the location that appreciates as buildings depreciate. Nor are higher prices good for everyone. What’s good for the goose (the seller) is not necessarily good for the gander (the buyer). Pulled by statistical ease and pushed by cultural norm, almost all of those few economists who do guesstimate the worth of Earth in America used price – a dead end. And when presenting a value for an asset, the default figure for economists is from the POV of the seller, speculator, profiteer, the “winner,” the recipient from the deal; not the buyer, investor, payor, the “loser,” the expender in the deal. In politics, winners write history. In economics, profiteers command statistics. However, those figures represent a minority position. When it comes to owning nature, far fewer people are landlords than tenants. While only a few receive rental income, almost everyone pays rent or a monthly mortgage or something equivalent. Hence periodic payments tell a truer story than does rental income. Besides the matters of utility and accuracy, price has an ethical fail-ing, too. In the modern mindset, price conveys ownership forever while rent conveys occupancy temporarily. Ownership, especially when concentrated, magnifies power while diminishing responsibilities toward community and environment. While most specialists use “price” and “value” interchangeably, one scholar used the terms “rents” and “values” interchangeably. He was also the one guy (who led his team) to tabulate land exclusively (not land plus buildings). That was David Albouy, of U Illinois and NBER, investigating the worth of cities. Fortunately for gadflies, official figures on spending for land are likely to be more accurate than official aggregates of the price of land. Political pressure influences economists and statisticians to slight land value. This pressure is off, as is the human tendency to adopt the winner’s POV, when it comes to spending. Yet the list is incomplete. People also pay to park and to play in parks.

Yet the list is incomplete. People also pay to park and to play in parks. Consumers pay for non-solid “land” (as economists define the term); water and intangible electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, paying the property tax keeps one’s title to land. Compared to other expenses, these would not be huge amounts, but they add up. This $3.5t does not tell the whole story. Besides Earth that someone is paying for, there’s land nobody is: land that’s owned free and clear, farmland lying fallow, unlogged forests, capped oil wells, un-auctioned airwaves, uncompensated eco-damages, etc. Paid-off homesites alone are worth $0.7t − 1/3rd of owners of real estate priced at $28t , rentable at $2.8t . All the other natural resources together would probably go for a third trillion. Eco-losses (clean ups, health costs, regulation, etc; Ch 23) a half-trillion. Adding this $1.5 trillion brings the value to … Showtime for the greatest stat on Earth, literally: The worth of Earth in America – $5 trillion (also the global value of exchange-traded funds). This amount per-capita registered voter is $2, 600 /month. The granddaddy of them all is limited liability. If you plan to put consumer and worker at risk, you can limit your liability by getting a corporate charter for a mere filing fee. Imagine if government were run like a business and charged as much as an insurance company would. That charge, the value of one privilege, could raise $1 trillion. That puts rent at $6 trillion (how much debt China keeps off its books). Per capita registered voter, that’s $3, 200 /month. Next, patents and copyrights. Getting one is like planting a flag on a field of knowledge, preventing everyone else from exploring there. That confers tremendous competitive advantage yet it, too, costs a mere filing fee. If government were to charge the market value of these monopolies it grants, it could rake in $2 trillion per year (Ch 24). Add that to the $60 ; now we’re at $8 trillion (also the amount of global debt, all stocks in developing nations, and the tourism industry). This amount per registered voter is $4, 200 /month. There’s more: the money monopoly. Our Founding Fathers gave the power to create new money to Congress, yet Congress gave that away to the central bankers. That forces us to spend far more on interest, fees, and inflated prices (directly in our household budgets and indirectly as taxes) than we would otherwise spend in a competitive market.

Inflation and interest on debt owed by consumers (including homebuyers), businesses, and government is well over $2 trillion, much of it rent, putting the total at $10t (minimum total in 401ks). Per registered voter: $5, 200 /month (the average salary for professionals). At $10 trillion, half of GDP, more than half of income or spending – re and privilege are just as valuable as labor and capital. Yet what do economists do? Ignore half of the economy. Perhaps because privilege is a creature of politics while creation is the subject of geology, academics see both as beyond the parameters of economics. This $10t isn’t authoritative. We’re not authorities. Yet authorities are not up to this task. Of all the totals by authorities, none is a measure of the money we spend for the nature we use. Ours is. Using official stats in a novel way, we showed how it’s done – quit looking for an official price and start looking for an official expense. Turn from price to rent, then from income to outgo, to finally measure the worth of Earth in America. Better than a lump-sum price, spending flows can tell you what phase of the business cycle you’re in. Once you start tracking this stream, updating daily, quarterly, or as much as feasible, then you’re in business as a prognosticator. Its positive changes, negative changes, they are great indicators. One can have faith in economic statistics again. Now to announce that from the mountain tops. You heard it here first. The worth of Earth in America is immense ed. The doubting Thomases in the economic arena may not now be believing Thomases, but at least some doubt has been sown into their doubt. The total does have shock value. Plus, it’s supremely useful, enabling both prediction and ebullience. Tell a friend. On the other hand, some specialists and members of the lay public may be satisfied with official figures for other economic trends yet criticize our unofficial figure for the worth of non-labor/non-capital. They exercise a double standard. What statistic is above reproof ? The rate of inflation is widely regarded as flawed, the percentage of unemployed is highly politicized, GDP is exaggerated.

When government releases its stats for GDP, inflation, and unemployment, officeholders don’t rush around rewriting their taxes and subsidies. At the peak of the business cycle, businesses whip up a feeding frenzy, ignoring warning signs. Yet those official stats, unlike ours, need not run the gauntlet. Our tabulated figure is as reliable as any other grand aggregate and better than most. But what is fair when it comes to money? Naturally, humans need to alter the environment, as do elephants so ruinous to the health of humans and other species? Actually, no, neither pollution nor depletion is necessary. However, because humans spend so much to own or use land and resources, owners and investors do just about anything to steer that massive spending their way. And because rent, being generated by society, is something for nothing, it, to use the jargon, creates moral hazard. The biggest sector in the GDP is F.I.R.E., the biggest in that is housing, and half of housing is land. To capture that rent stream, business wins favors for sprawl. Another large sector is energy; again, business wins favors for combustible fuels like oil that burn dirty, over incessant power sources like sunlight that operate cleanly. Further, consumers buy a lot of food, including meat; ranchers win more favors than organic gardeners, while cattle trample stream banks and emit enough methane to alter the atmosphere. At the bottom of the eco-crisis is the insider’s relentless grasping for the vast flow of rent. Counterbalancing all that, knowing Earth’s true worth might make environmentalists into economic realists. It’s not rational of them to let land remain such a fat profit-maker and expect a law that “just-saysno” to development to succeed. To defend an ecosystem, your planet needs profit on its side. What does appreciate and account for the accumulated and swelling riches is land as location plus privileges, especially patents and copyrights dished out at way below market value. Land and privilege – created by neither labor nor capital – inflate in value faster than do any goods or services offered to consumers and investors. Bloomberg’s Noah Smith, 27 March 2015: “… in order to address wealth inequality, it’s important to focus on land.

It’s landlords, not corporate overlords, who are sucking up the wealth in the economy.” No matter who’s in power—whether opposed to government or not – government continues to self-aggrandize. Of course as the economy grows, so must government – air traffic requires air traffic controllers, and so on. Yet the bulk of expansion consists of bureaucracy to assist ordinary people who’re needy, not receiving any shares of rent, and of expenditures on corporate welfare, to direct rent to insider elites. Present rent recipients influence budget priorities. Rockefellers and the “oiligarachy” via their Council on Foreign Affars define much of US foreign policy, and the military expands malignantly. Doctors receive license rent and medicare is a huge and growing expense. Bill Gates, uber enriched with patent rent, has his foundations redo classroom curriculum and global public health while ignoring alternatives that enable choice. As income rises, and lucky recipients bid up locations, rising rent indicates ground trafficking. Some speculators keep land from best use, even vacant, precluding others from investing or working there. As the custom of property is presently construed, progress for some must mean poverty for others, as Henry George explained in Progess and Poverty a century and a half ago Ironically, people opposed to government win office and control much of it. Nevertheless, even with them at the helm, government has outgrown even a mammoth-sized bathtub “to drown it in.” If Grover Norquist’s friends everhope to put obese states on a diet, they’d better put rents into different pockets, perhaps into the pockets of all citizens.. What do postmortems on economic peaks reveal? What causes the fall in consumption and the rise in firings, bankruptcies, and foreclosures? It’s not that goods or services have become unaffordable; locations have. As their prices rise, buyers spend more on that asset that nobody created and less on the goods and services that their neighbors and compatriots produce, while owners burn through equity to keep abreast. The heady climb of site values into the stratosphere finally reaches a point where a critical mass can not afford sites. By then, gleeful developers and lenders will have overextended themselves. Spending on produced goods and services will have become too little to maintain sufficient exchange among economics actors. With customers too few and debt too massive, recession results – the gamblers’ backwash terminating the mad dash for rents.

As the shiny lure which urges on so many major economic behaviors, flowing rent must be immense, and is. Measuring it is immensely useful. And recur recessions must, as more people bid more money for the most desirable sites. During the upswing of the business cycle – the first 14 years of this 18-year curve – land value mostly rises. Noting the rise, investors go all-in. Not knowing this cycle, many lose fortunes. If they’re not a major player, government does not bail them out. Already, some savvy firms sell accurate forecasts based on this landprice cycle – Hoyt in Florida and a couple in Australia are the ones I’ve found. Why don’t they all? Does it have something to do with rocking the economic boat? Whatever. With a reliable figure in hand, at least we non-specialists can take advantage. Knowing what’s coming lets us safeguard our savings. One definition of surplus is excess, an amount greater than necessity. Another way of looking at surplus is as a bonus, as an unexpected extra output from the applied input. A third way to regard surplus is not so much as a quantity as a quality that is, output due not to exertion—labor or capital—so much as due to happenstance, to land or location, harkening back a couple centuries to David Ricardo, economist and winner at stocks. It’s the third understanding economists use when asserting land value is a surplus. Hence how much people pay for land is a surplus, too. The more rent flows, the more successful the economy has been. Rent indicates economic health better than GDP, which ignores surplus while honing in on growth. An even better indicator is free time, a consequence of a successful economy. Leisure is society’s rational use of rent. The greater the leisure, the more equitable the sharing of the surplus has been. The greater the vacant lot’s value, the greater the loss to society.

Although cautious “experts” lag behind the curious public, eventually they’ll come around, as they always do when out-numbered and out-enthused. Discovering this datum useful, the users will want it updated, more precise. Sensitive to popular pressure (number-crunchers are people too), and wishing to mollify the serious amateur, academics will both refine the methodology and update the ongoing measure. These agencies could make that datum a permanent part of their regular reports. That would institutionalize rent as an indicator, hopefully in a user-friendly form. Whenever the mood struck, you could find out how much your society spends on the nature it uses. You’d know your economy’s bounty, and what to expect next. The New York Stock Exchange, not far from the Fed, updates the prices of stocks once every second, and somebody does bonds. The technology and correctible rough statistics exist to track nature and privilege. Society could have the stat for all rents every day. Measuring surplus will become the new normal, and enjoy all the benefits conferred by normalcy bias. Then, of course, everybody will act like they knew about the role of Earth’s worth all along. f you’re going to have taxes, consider the advice of every major economic thinker from Adam Smith on down. They noted that a great tax base is land value. Two dozen prominent American economists, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, advised the new Russia to shift taxes off labor and capital, onto land. Society need not even use a tax. A lease (as in port districts), a fee (such as a deed fee), dues (as in HOAs), or another fiscal tool would work as well. Historically, several places chose the tax. Having to pay it motivates owners of nature’s surface to use their land efficiently. From that improvement cascades a bundle of benefits. Given that track record of success, it makes a curious person wonder about curious governments. Why don’t they measure the value of Earth in America? Since nature and privilege could combine into an awesome tax base (Ch 37), why don’t officeholders have their bureaucrats figure out how much revenue is available? Try influence. Look at Prop. 13 and its sequels. Homeowners resist giving up their land value, even when it makes their community healthier.

Look at Prop. 13 and its sequels. Homeowners resist giving up their land value, even when it makes their community healthier. A rational politician [sic] might worry that landowners would vote against “her/him” if they proposed public recovery of socially-generated land value. So, if officeholders are not going to recover it, why measure it? Because. Measuring the value of sites, resources, and government-granted privileges would put a spotlight, wanted or not, on their total value – and that empowers people. Aware of that statistic, a citizen could anticipate the business cycle, to mention just one good use (Ch 38). Plus, once enough people see how much is at stake, and learn how beneficial tapping it could be, that might tempt a majority to go ahead and tap. People worry that it’d be harder to stay in their homes. And their homes, for gosh sakes, sit on land – their land! People live and die for land. If any policy triggers humanity’s territorial imperative, that’s it. All life – even ants and plants – fights for turf. Yet the fight is supposedly futile, “For the Land is Mine” – “God,” Yet battles persist. Other taxes on a source of rent do not trigger this emotional reaction. People are OK with taxing oil; nobody literally lives on oil. And they’re largely indifferent to higher fees for patents – which unbeknownst to many could rake in trillions annually – since tech giants could easily afford to cover their claims on the field of knowledge. But for us land animals, taxing territory is a totally different matter. The tax collector (government) is the institution with unmatched power. In an autocracy, they could charge as much as they like, evict anyone in their way. Their demanding rent would turn government into a land over-lord. Or so some worry. And not without reason, especially if one has had dealings with the IRS or felt pushed around by government exercising eminent domain. Some angry opponents label a tax on land as ultra-leftist. However, if akin to any ideology it’d be Christian, with its notion of surrendering to Caesar what is Caesar’s, or, pay over to society the values society has generated.

The Indians burst out laughing and said that now they knew the white man was lying all along, because nobody could own the land. However, once tribes settled down to farm, then communities did own the land. Next, when community settlements increased and families ruled, the head of the family owned the land. Later, as population and independence grew, yes, an individual could own what was once Mother Earth. Now, with thick density and cold autonomy, individual ownership is the new normal. ronically, an objective study of the issue shows these fears to be un-Ifounded. What should be feared is government’s failure to recover socially generated values. Where governments thus fail, elites gobble up the rent. They erect a steep hierarchy, widen the gap between haves and havenots, and behave more oppressively. The World Bank showed this true for nations, but it applies to states, too. While some voice outrage about paying land value to government and having government confiscate their land – things that remain largely figments of overheated imagination – their outrage is muted about paying mortgages inflated by speculation and banks foreclosing on homeowners; actual tragedies afflicting sizable numbers. It’s banks, the property of elites, who do the most confiscating of land; governments not so much. Governments do confiscate a portion of income directly and indirectly, by taxing sales. Most people consider such taxation as moral or amoral but not immoral, despite those values being individually generated as opposed to socially generated, as are site values. For most of us, socially generated value is a foreign concept. What people do complain about is the amount. A land tax would be yet another tax. While true, how much people would pay equals how much mortgage people would not pay. That’s so because as the tax on land goes up, the price of land goes down. When society chooses to “socialize” land rent, none is leftover for speculators and other owners to capitalize into price. Thereby the land tax does not change how much one pays but to whom one pays it, to neighbors rather than to a banker. That keeps it in the family, so to speak.

Despite paying over more land value than they’d like, people do receive a bigger bang for the buck. While it’s a small sample, the State of New Hampshire only levies a property tax – falling on both land and buildings. The Granite State ranks much higher than most other states by almost every measure. More irony: the only way to solve foreclosures is to levy land. When owners must pay out site rent rather than keep it, speculators lose their reason to withhold sites from use. They reverse course and develop their sites. The resultant greater supply of sites in use also lowers what buyers and tenants pay for underlying land. So, mortgages shrivel and with it a buyer’s inability to pay. Thus foreclosures, too, decrease. Turn from emotion to cool self-interest. Most people own some land themselves (whether outright or not). Many view this payment as a tax on the middle class, and as a tax that would spare the rich. Which is ironic; it’s an urban myth the rich are happy to hear. They know where their fortunes come from – downtown locations. Their parts of cities, New York, London, Tokyo, et al, have the spendiest real estate on earth. They also corral the rents paid for oil and privileges like monopolies on fields of knowledge (patents and copyrights). A tax on land would mean far heftier payments by them than by anyone in the middle class. I Opponents to the idea of taxing land claim it’d discourage development. Yet the reverse is true. Where government fails to recover ground rent, a few owners can own more than they can possibly use and keep many prime sites out of productive use. Hence the economy is sluggish, both investment and wages are low, the income and wealth gaps are wide, and poverty appears intractable. To correct that, advocates of geonomic logic as laid out by Henry George, the follower of Ricardo who in the 1880s was the third most popular figure in America after Thomas Edison and Mark Twain (one of George’s admirers), found legislators willing to listen. Hence, some jurisdictions have levied land. Most shifted their property tax off of buildings, onto locations. Having to pay land dues spurs owners to put sites to good use or sell to someone who will. Places that tax land, not buildings, attract investors.

The Steel City was named America’s Most Livable City two years running. Like the old carrot and stick, the levy on land spurs owners to develop vacant lots and parking lots, while the zero tax on buildings entices owners to improve or replace antiquated or abandoned buildings. Those owners erecting buildings infill cities. In compact cities, residents do not rely on cars so much and walk more, ride bikes and take buses. Happily for life forms, tax-spurred development is tempered, benefitting the environment. Where the community does require owners to pay “land dues” (or the equivalent), owners tend to take no more than they can use and to use that wisely. Those kinds of decisions reduce both depletion and pollution. Without even thinking about it, people leave behind fewer byproducts that pollute (Ch 29). Owners engaged in development add to the housing stock; as supply goes up, the price of housing goes down. Plus, paying the rental value of locations as land dues removes that value from the price of housing; locations of reduced price mean housing of reduced price, too. During the two decades that Pittsburgh shifted its tax from buildings to land, their housing was prize-winning affordable. With our current relationship to land as property – versus land as “trusterty” in the language of Ralph Borsodi – we guarantee ourselves periodic recessions. When bankruptcies mount and the newly unemployed line up at (un)employment offices, our recurring recessions slash the ranks of property owners. Our self-imposed recessions keep ownership a dream for many and a memory for others. While property is wonderful, it’s even more wonderful when more people can hang on to it. Which they can, when their economy is not in recession. Any place can avoid a downturn. Certain Australian towns that taxed land opened new factories … during a recession! In neighboring towns, factories were closing. If other jurisdictions were to duplicate what smart towns do, drastic recessions would become a thing of the past. When owners develop vacant lots and rehab abandoned buildings to earn more money in order to pay their land dues, they develop the entire region, spur the economy, and spread prosperity.

Of course they had to follow reason and confront political reality, yet in doing so they produced a more impressive resume than most other reform attempts.1 Singapore, along with Hong Kong, is often rated as the best city in the world for doing business; plus, the freest city. The people doing the ratings are capitalists with their own ideas of freedom and justice. Those raters note both cities levy fewer and smaller taxes yet those judges leave out the fact that both places recover lots of socially-generated land value. In Singapore, all the land is private, owned by private citizens, but taxed at a high rate. In Hong Kong, all the land is owned by the public and leased to the owners of buildings. Semantically, there’s a difference, but functionally the two policies are pretty much the same. And the benefits are laid out for all to see: prosperity, big middle classes (now shrinking in places like America and Germany), and enough public revenue to afford quality public services, and even a dividend, in Singapore.2 For many people, it’s hard to believe that public recovery of site value really works that well. And if it’s such a good idea, why is not better known and more widely used? All these examples are from the past, not the present. Even when society took these first steps toward economic perfection, they immediately got derailed. Repeatedly. Why? How? Public recovery of social surplus sows the seeds of its own destruction. It gets repealed because it works. It greatly improves an economy’s performance. Its participants, getting more income, spend more money on land, pushing up location value. Speculators see that climb in price and want it for themselves. Given the political power of the real estate lobby, they get the landward tax-shift repealed much more quickly than it ever took proponents to get it adopted.

If they buy up great parts of America and that worries you, don’t let it. Just recover land value and enjoy the benefits. Plus, your public treasury will be flush. If the worth-of-earth figure were available and were huge and if you’re not getting any or much of it, then you should know it’s concentrated. Not that you’d do anything about that. But the few who now get the lion’s share, they don’t know how obedient and lethargic you are. They might worry that a fat rent figure could light a fire under you, and make bounty a boon for everybody, not for just those lucky few. Social movements need such fires. • At Bloomberg – a billionaire’s website for businesses – a columnist, Noah Smith (no relation, surprisingly), calls for a real solution, no matter how cutting edge and ahead of the pack – tax the value of locations” (9 September 2015). He adds, for affordable housing … “there’s one very powerful policy that cities and the activists who love them haven’t yet employed – the land value tax.” A land-value tax is an efficient and fair way to take a city that now works only for lucky prosperous landowners, and turn it into a place where the working class can afford to make a decent life (24 October 2017). Those voices, plus knowing the size of land value as a potential tax base, could give timid politicians the confidence to take a page from the Pittsburgh playbook and shift taxes off of people’s efforts (wages, sales, and buildings) and onto the low-hanging fruit produced by nobody – the ground beneath your feet. To deal with possible losers, if any landowner could show a net loss after paying land dues, then the government could pay such deprived owners a bond. A few unlucky souls should not have to pay the cost of a reform that benefits the many. Governments would not have to pay a lump sum but an annuity out of the recovered rents. Beyond just net losers, government could pay everybody; combine the taking with a sharing.

Paying a literal dividend or a subsidy to all residents is how Aspen won its sort of land tax, how Alaska passed its oil tax, and how British Columbia passed its carbon tax. For most residents owning land of average or less value, the dividend would exceed their land dues, since commercial sites pull the average up so high. Money in the pocket – a rent share greater than the land dues one pays – makes the paying in more than palatable. It’s almost a no-brainer (next chapter). Lord Bertrand Russell, who lived to almost 98, was asked, “What’s the dif-ference between ignorance and apathy?” He answered, “I don’t know – and matica, which in 900 pages gave math its logical underpinnings. Russell also proposed that society share natural rent. Is that what we should do with the immense ocean that is the full worth of Earth in America? Or take a page from the Aspen playbook and turn the value of locations and natural resources into a source of funding for something like Social Security for everyone (#4). Then nearly everyone would take an interest in measuring the size of society’s surplus. Conversely, were government or academia to calculate the worth of Earth in America, that figure would likely intrigue people with the question of what to do with so much bounty. No matter what we choose, once we know its size then we know the health of our economy and when to anticipate its ups and downs. While some object to public spending on the poor, they do not object to politicians providing corporate welfare to the rich, which pays off bigtime. A sizable portion of enormous fortunes are not earned. Didier Jacobs, senior economist for Oxfam America, estimated in 2016 that about 75% of U.S. billionaire wealth is derived from rents. Those who admire the unduly fortunate and oppose largesse for the innocent unlucky extend that double standard to embrace themselves. They do not clamor to repeal the handouts they get: Social Security, COLA, Medicare, public schools funded in part by childless homeowners, etc. For them, a freebie is good for the goose, not the gander. Further, objectors claim many recipients would waste their share, even though they do not object to current rentiers wasting more than their share on a profligate lifestyle.

Critics fear many recipients would quit working despite the fact many can’t keep working because their jobs are disappearing. It’s good riddance in many cases, since a huge number of jobs are not productive but merely conformist; the work does not actually produce food, clothing, shelter, energy, transportation, medicine, or recreation. Indeed, most work is a waste of life. First, nobody made Earth, so our spending for land and resources never rewards anybody’s labor or capital. None of us can buy land from the maker. You buy goods and services from their producers and providers, but not land and other natural resources. That’s why spending is of two types, rewarding either effort or status. Second, enjoying an equal right to life, and needing land in order to live, we all enjoy an equal right to land. It’s a right that occasionally conflicts with instinct, as when long-term residents oppose short-termers – “You don’t belong here.” Belong or not, within our group, when we claim or occupy a location, we displace everyone else. Hence, we owe them compensation, just as everyone else owes us compensation for displacing us. Third, while nobody made land, everybody makes its locations valuable. It’s not owners but the presence of society that generates land value. It’s not old-timers selling out and moving on but newcomers buying up and settling in. The most powerful and accurate generator of land value is population density, something no owner by himself can claim responsibility for. Thus, our popular interpretation of property is a shared delusion. Our paying dues, then getting dividends, differs from our paying sellers to leave the lot behind. Instead, owners pay their neighbors in order to stay. It’s compensation for having displaced them. That feels different from the indifference one gets when paying any other price. It feels more like contributing one’s share to a common kitty. Were modern humans persuaded that sharing the gains from land is just, they’d not be the first – far from it. For millennia sharing was customary. Gatherer/hunters shared their pickings and game. Recall the Indians in the Pacific Northwest with so much natural wealth (even if primitive); they lost their material insecurity. One did not show off and gain status by hoarding stuff but by giving it away. Their potlatches still exist today.

At the beginning of the Agrarian age, the whole harvest went into the community granary and back out in equitable shares. Later, kings were supposed to disburse this output equitably. Of course, royalty got away from that duty, and just kept the lion’s share. One exception was early in the Industrial Revolution when England paid people a stipend to buy bread. People are basically generous. In the past, workers via their unions did their best to take care of the poor. Presently people are still generous, donating to churches and charities. Even those who weren’t too generous on their way up became charitable once they arrived at the top. It’s in our genes. • The State of Hawaii passed a resolution in favor. • In Congress, Rep. of Minnesota Keith Ellison expressed his support. • Several governments planned a trial run for a limited number of recipients in 2017. Stockton, California planned to test a basic income. At Cash Conference in San Francisco, the town’s mayor, Michael Tubbs, said the program isn’t a response to encroaching technology. “Basic income isn’t about a scary future where robots run everything. It’s about today, when working people can’t afford rent.” Note that word, “rent.” As for funding Basic Income, proponents have yet to find consensus around its source. None of those proponents appeared cognizant of social surplus. If the source of extra income is anything but surplus, then when recipients spend it, they’d inflate prices. Landlords in particular would just raise their charge. Note how: Using fees or dues or taxes, government would redirect society’s spending for land, natural resources, the electromagnetic spectrum, ecosystem services, and the rest of the planet that we find useful enough to be willing to pay for it, etc., temporarily into the public treasury then back out.

My career as an art director began at the Oxford American magazine while best-selling author John Grisham was its publisher. I served in the same capacity for the Weekly Standard magazine, which was headed by Bill Kristol, son of Irving Kristol and Vice-President Dan Quayle’s chief of staff, and favorite conservative commentator Fred Barnes. I worked with FoxNews’ Tucker Carlson and David Brooks, columnist for the New York Times, among others. More recently, I helped found the Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area, one of only 55 such areas in the country, each established by Congress. Our heritage area shares and interprets the creative legacies of some of America’s greatest cultural icons including Elvis Presley, Tammy Wynette, Howlin’ Wolf, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner. On a modern, conventional clock, the twelve o’clock position marks the point at which, when all three hands – the hour, the minute, and the second – converge, that brief moment is both the end of the previous twelve hours and simultaneously the beginning of the new twelve. (If you wanna argue that the new hour doesn’t actually begin until the second hand ticks forward, go right ahead. You’re missing the point.) f you are a Christian, you believe I that we are all condemned sinners, but that there is hope in that we can be forgiven through profession of faith in Jesus Christ. God has a plan for our personal salvation. We are saved from “the second death” by God on Judgment Day when the whole world and all the dead are judged. Looking at the world today, it would be hard for many Christians to argue with the assertion that a lot of these signs have been fulfilled and that the world is deserving of God’s wrath. Sin, as traditionally defined, is rampant, flaunted, gloried, normalized and praised in every facet of our popular culture – and, increasingly, our civic culture, as well. But while some might emphasize that man by his very nature is incorrigibly depraved and, without God’s salvation, deserving of eternal damnation, others would take a less harsh view of human nature; and, while not arguing against individual accountability, contend that it is the evil world system in which we exist – one that is increasingly incapable of turning out anything other than radically warped human beings – which must be judged and destroyed. have studied and written extensively about this “evil world system” in I its current technologically-empowered form as well as its historical predecessors.

There is a case to be made that throughout the centuries these together constitute one continuous, supernaturally-empowered stream of pure evil spewing forth from the mouth of hell, but that’s another subject for another time. However, I would point out that the manifest evil I have documented is gargantuan in its proportions and hideous in nature – even beyond what many Bible-believing Christians are aware of or prepared to believe. I’m not talking Sunday-school, fairy-tale evil, but rather super-sophisticated, multigenerational, near-omniscient evil controlling practically every aspect of the world we live in. Incredibly well-organized, supernaturally-empowered, awe-inspiring, tantalizing, insanely-seductive, wildly-attractive-and-tempting evil. Evil without limits, with access to near-infinite resources. Evil practiced enthusiastically by ultra-wealthy, ultra-influential, Satan-worshipping, Lucifer-loving elite families, whose bloodlines extend back into antiquity and whose thirst for wealth, power and human blood knows no bounds. Evil that views human beings as commodities, as just one more natural resource to be manipulated and exploited. We are by orders of magnitude lesser beings than they, and worthy only of being reviled and abused. They are engaged in a program of “full-spectrum dominance” against mankind, controlling us and exploiting us on every level possible, manipulating and degrading our bodies, minds and spirits. They are actively and purposefully destroying our planet, our home, made for us by the Creator. The environmental degradation we witness all around us is not simply the result of greed, of indifference, of global industrialization, of “capitalism run amok.” They are re-writing our DNA and that of much of the life on this planet – befouling our genes, poisoning our soil, water and air through indiscriminant pollution. They are actively and enthusiastically re-creating our world in pursuit of a planet that is the antithesis of the one God created, and they are doing the same to us – remaking us in the image of Evil. going spiritual battle for our minds and eternal souls. How can such monumental evil ever be countered? Not by human hands, but only by what Christian author C.S.

Because it is not just a message written in the heavens above – God has reiterated it in multiple ways, confirmed it and reconfirmed it in ways that only He could … on a human scale, if you will, through means that we can readily understand and relate to. He does not leave us to guess whether or not the message is from Him. He makes it abundantly clear, even going so far as to provide what could be viewed as “confirmation codes.” Sound a bit whacky to you?

It takes approximately 26,000 years for the earth to complete one wobble. The sun’s position relative to the constellations is what determines which age (Pisces, Aquarius, etc.) we are in. All of the ages combined constitute the Great Age, or Great Year or Platonic Year. One full journey through the signs of the Zodiac equals one Great Age. Hence the term, “the wisdom of the ages.” A substantial percentage of conservatively-oriented Christians already believe that the signs of the Apocalypse are everywhere, and almost daily witness what they believe to be fulfillment of Biblical end-times prophecies. Enormously successful books have been written on the subject, not the least of which being Tim LaHaye’s Left Behind series. Before we really dig in, here’s a good question: if a significant percent-age of the faithful already believe that it’s the end of the world based on what they believe to be fulfilled prophecy, what would be the point in some kinda cosmic clock or supposed “end-times message from God”? Wouldn’t it kinda be a moot point? My goal here is to show you that God has very plainly told us that NOW is the time, and told us in such an unmistakable and convincing way that it will not only confirm the faithful’s existing beliefs about where we are on God’s timeline, but will also attract the interest and attention of unbelievers, as well. God is re-awakening an ancient knowledge in our hearts and minds so that we may have peace in the face of everything falling apart, and He is confirming his message in the universal language of mathematics.

But fortunately for you, we’re not gonna start with the numbers. The Milky Way being the most dominant feature in the night sky, the “nuclear bulge” is the most prominent part of it. This bulge, the area surrounding its center, resembles a heavenly mountain and was often represented as such in ancient myths. It was also viewed as a cosmic womb and various other things. It was often held to be our heavenly home, the source of being. In its circular journey through the 12 signs of the Zodiac during the 26,000-year Precession of the Equinoxes, or Cycle of Precession, the sun visually passes through the nuclear bulge and almost, but not quite, directly through the center of the galaxy – which, I’ll remind you, both Sagittarius’ arrow and Scorpio’s stinger point directly towards. Our sun has been crossing the Galactic Equator (this is not a real thing, it’s similar to the earth’s equator, an imaginary dividing line) for the past 40 or so years, during a period that has been termed “Galactic Alignment.” This alignment began around 1976 when the sun began moving across the galaxy’s equatorial line. The alignment was at its most precise, its mid-point, in 1998, and the sun will be completely clear of the Galactic Equator at the end of 2021.

As you can see below, the general concept of “God’s Clock” is not a new one. Various theories have been put forward over the years, many tied to dates and numbers contained in scripture.

Astute astronomical observers that they were, they did foresee and foretell of the coming Galactic Alignment – with remarkable accuracy, considering that they lived in the jungles of South America hundreds of years ago. They created numerous myths about this future alignment, myths incorporating characters based on the constellations, and they timed their sophisticated calendar to this event, as well. But all the supposed predictions of doom and destruction? These, contend scholars, were all just part of their mythology. And it’s fairly obvious that the world did not come to an end on that date. The Maya also held that the end of 13 baktun marked the end of the Fifth Sun, or Age, each of which lasts 1,872,000 days. Using a 360-day year, that is precisely 5,200 years. Five Ages, each 5,200 years in length, a total of 26,000 years and 9,360,000 days. It certainly appears that the Maya were aware not only of “Galactic Alignment,” but also of the Great Age, the Grand Cycle. (Now, when you hear someone refer to “The End of Days,” you can tell them how many.) Why did they pin the end of 13 baktun to the year 2012? Recall that modern astronomers place the date of the most precise moment of galactic alignment in 1998, fourteen years earlier, and that the end of the alignment will occur in 2021, nine years after 2012. But also recall when the Maya were making their calculations. The year 2012 was certainly well within the roughly 45-year window of Galactic Alignment. he first extant account of the five successive ages of humanity comes from the TGreek poet Hesiod in his poem Works and Days, in which he lists them as Golden, Silver, Bronze, Heroic and Iron. The Five Ages of Man generally correspond to the five stages of human development – infancy, childhood, adolescence, manhood/adulthood and old age – drawing a parallel between the maturation of the individual and that of the species. Returning from the jungles of South America to the pages of scripture, we note that there are well-known numbers of importance within the Bible, among them being 144,000, the number of days in the Mayan baktun. Coincidence? That’s certainly a possibility.

No one could learn this song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4 They have kept themselves as pure as virgins, following the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among the people on the earth as a special offering [or, “firstfruits”] to God and to the Lamb. 5 They have told no lies; they are without blame. Interpreting Revelation is an enormous challenge, due in no small part to the fact that the author’s frame of reference is constantly changing. His perspective is continually switching back and forth between scenes he is witnessing on earth, in heaven, “in spirit” (out of body) and with his own two eyes. It can be difficult to know where we are or what we’re looking at. As a result, there are about as many different interpretations of Revelation as there are denominations in the Christian faith (over 20,000). It is practically a Rorschach Inkblot Test, and I’m not here to debate the particulars, or to argue over whether or not the “locusts” in Chapter 9 are in fact Apache attack helicopters, as some contend. Analyses of Revelation run the gamut with a multitude of interpretations written by Christian and non-Christians alike. Some researchers claim that there is alchemical symbolism (the “white stone,” as the fabled Philosopher’s Stone in alchemy is sometimes referred to) in its verses. Others discuss what is termed “astrotheological symbolism” – astronomical references, descriptions of beings or objects that are based upon various constellations, such as the “eagle with wings spread out as though in flight,” purported to be a reference to Aquila the Eagle. It has been proposed that Revelation is, at least in part and perhaps in whole, a giant astrotheological drama in the heavens. Some have even argued that it is an unfolding prophetic drama, projecting forward from the time it was written to contemporary times – a fact that, if true, would be entirely consistent with the astronomical myth-making of a multitude of ancient cultures, including the Greeks and the Maya.

He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them. 4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.” The city wall was broad and high, with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels. And the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates. 13 There were three gates on each side – east, north, south, and west. 14 The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 15 The angel who talked to me held in his hand a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 16 When he measured it, he found it was a square, as wide as it was long. In fact, its length and width and height were each 12,000 stadia [1,400 miles, 2,220 kilometers]. 17 Then he measured the walls and found them to be 144 cubits [216 feet, 65 meters] thick (according to the human standard used by the angel).

The city wall is built on a foundation, “twelve foundations” – the number of the foundation is twelve, and the length of the foundation of each side of the city we know to be 12,000: 12 times 12,000 equals 144,000; 1,728,000 plus 144,000 equals 1,872,000. Bingo. his is a metaphorical construct. Go with the logic. Use your common sense. Don’t get all uptight about it. The city has a floor, of course: what does the city itself within the walls rest upon? Are we not repeatedly admonished throughout scripture to build our house on solid rock? (Okay, crystal in this instance; jasper, to be exact.) Each of the five faces of the city are of equal measure, each representing one of the Five Ages, each conveying the exact number of days in each of these ages, with the cube itself representing the Great Age and the total number of days therein.

He shouted to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Swing your sickle now to gather the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for they are ripe for judgment.” 19 So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and loaded the grapes into the great winepress of God’s wrath. 20 The grapes were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress in a stream about 1,600 stadia (180 miles, 300 kilometers) long and as high as a horse’s bridle. Here again, we should note that it would be unwise to doubt any of the promises of God, including His warning that He will judge the whole world. But are we really intended to believe here that He’s going to instruct one of His angels to round up every inhabitant of earth, shove them into a giant bucket and stomp their guts out? Unfortunately, the only number I see here is 1,600, so we may be wrap-ping this one up early: “1,600 stadia long and as high as a horse’s bridle.” Now, if there were a standard, widely-known measurement for the height of a horse’s bridle, we might be in business. And it just so happens that this is indeed the case. Well, first of all, 1,600 is the square of 40, the Mother of All Biblically-Significant Numbers: during the Great Flood, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights; the Jews wandered in the wilderness for 40 years; Moses was on the mount for 40 days receiving the Law; Saul and David reigned for 40 years; 40 days were given to Nineveh; Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness for 40 days, and he spent the same amount of time with his disciples following his resurrection, and on and on. So there’s that. [14] Then I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of mighty ocean waves or the rolling of loud thunder.

No one could learn this song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4 They have kept themselves as pure as virgins, following the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among the people on the earth as a special offering [or, “firstfruits”] to God and to the Lamb. 5 They have told no lies; they are without blame. The chapter begins with the use of the number 144,000 twice in the plain text in two sequential paragraphs, referring to the “firstfruits,” those who had already been redeemed from the earth. So, the whole earth has been harvested, yielding a number that is exactly 144,000 shy of what we know to be the full number of days in the Great Age, and we are reminded, twice, in the first part of the chapter, about the firstfruits, all 144,000 of them. The obvious message: add the 144,000. Does this mean that the events described in Revelation are about to begin? I cannot answer that question. I can merely respond with another question: Why would God give us this knowledge at this specific time in history if we weren’t on the very doorstep of a highly-significant moment in the unfolding of His Divine Plan? God does not play games and He does not waste time. “The sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens.” This means that there will be a sign, a definitive sign, and, further, that it will appear in the heavens. Not in the sky, in the heavens. And we will see the Son of Man “coming on the clouds of heaven” – again, not the clouds in the sky, but “of heaven.” Scripture explains that Christ was born, lived, was crucified, died and resurrected as ordained by God to secure the salvation of our souls, to save us from “the second death,” eternal damnation in the lake of fire – soul death. The Bible teaches that this is the seminal event in all of human history: God providing a means for us to have eternal life with Him. Galactic Alignment can thus be viewed as the time when the sun, which has been moving slowly towards this place of crossing over the millennia, is suspended upon the Heavenly Cross.

This event occurs at Galactic Center, which, as we’ve already learned, has, among other things, been symbolically represented by various cultures as a skull. Through the Hand of God’s Providence, did Christ’s death, burial and resurrection – the most important event in all of history – symbolically foreshadow the unique astronomical alignment that would exist at the designated time of Jesus’ return? Is this “the sign that the Son of Man is coming,” appearing, as promised, “in the heavens”? The name of God used most often in the Hebrew Bible is referred to as the “Tetragrammaton,” written יהוה , and transliterated as YHWH in English. Jewish tradition held that the divine name was too sacred to be uttered, and in synagogue rituals it was replaced with the Hebrew word Adonai (“My Lord”). In most English translations of the Bible, YHWH is replaced with “the Lord.” YHWH is generally pronounced and spelled out “Yahweh” (or, alternately and less accurately, “Jehovah”; there was no equivalent for the letter “j” in the Hebrew alphabet). God’s name is special: it is his chosen and revealed name. Gematria is the practice of substituting an assigned numerical value for a specific letter, and the values for YHWH are 10, 5, 6 and 5. Added, these total 26, and that number has long been associated with the name of God. It is the number of God’s name. We have discovered that there are two encodings of the lengthof the Great Age in Revelation, both of which utilize the Pro-phetic Year. We might refer to this 26,000-Prophetic-Year Clock as “YHWH’s Timepiece.” Yet, almost unbelievably, there appears to be a second “secret clock” tracking the length of the Great Year. The Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year when the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, falls on December 21^(st) on the modern calendar. Traditionally, the Winter Solstice marked the symbolic death of the sun, with its rebirth – the start of its upward journey through the sky – beginning soon thereafter. he exact moment of Winter Solstice in 2012, the year of the Mayan TNon-Doomsday, as listed on the U.S. Naval Observatory’s website for years in advance, was precisely 11:11 UT (Universal Time): 11:11 on 12/21.

Unable to afford in such quantities both guns and butter, as the saying went, despite its enormous economy, the United States was undergoing inflation. Simultaneously in the throes of Watergate, it was unable to avert the Yom Kippur War of 1973 or to do more than stand by as Arab petroleum producers first organized an oil boycott to protest the West’s tolerance of Israel’s policies and then activated OPEC, the international oil cartel, in early 1974. The United States government was able to lead internationally during the global era, especially when doing so sensibly, but it could no longer be as confident that either its own public or those of other liberal countries would follow. Solid domestic support for defending vital U.S. and allied national security interests around the world held through the mature Pax Americana and beyond, but after the war in Vietnam the public was wary of ethically ambiguous involvements and impatient with ill-conceived, open-ended, or mismanaged ones. There was widespread concern at home and abroad about such limited but questionable U.S. engagements as those in Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan, and Iraq. U.S. power remained predominant globally, but the range of circumstances under which it could be employed was restricted. Democratic peoples around the world had little trouble distinguishing between horror at the threat of Soviet occupation and annoyance and resentment over seemingly arbitrary American intervention, but as the Soviet threat diminished, many were becoming more concerned with U.S. action abroad as well. Through it all, the Pax Americana reaped a bountiful harvest of beneficial global developments. Among the most important of them, the Cold War with China was suspended in large steps during the 1970s as a result of the normalization of relations achieved by Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972, the death of Mao and failed coup by the “Gang of Four” in 1976, and the establishment of the Deng Xiaoping regime in 1978. Deng remained the regime’s paramount figure until 1992. The most dramatic fruition of the Pax Americana came when after several years of liberalization under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet empire reverted to its Russian core as the Eastern European satellite countries were ceded their freedom between 1989 and 1991. The Baltic States were also soon granted independence, and much of Eastern Europe quickly stepped into the global-liberal mainstream. The other non-Russian republics were given independence as well.

Propped up by an enormous security apparatus and abject fear of the heavy boot, Soviet rule was illegitimate at its core. Its immorality was widely perceived even in Russia, in part as a consequence of the opening made there to Western culture in the decades following the death of Stalin. The last straw was the debacle of the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979-89). The Soviets were halted and the tide turned by mujahedeen guerrillas wielding CIA-supplied, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles to devastatingly counter the invaders’ air advantage. Its military defeat further discredited the Soviet regime and empire and intensified popular revulsion against them.17 Overextended in Afghanistan and elsewhere, an economically stressed politburo had quietly decided under Andropov in December of 1981 that thereafter the USSR would not again intervene in Eastern Europe should the subject countries assert their independence.1 The leadership of Gorbachev (1985-91) combined with the Soviet military rout and crisis of acceptance to liberalize and bring down the regime and empire. Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika, respectively openness and restructuring, essentially made public the end of the threat of Soviet intervention that had long hung over the subject countries. Before reform had progressed far at home, it led to the unraveling of the Soviet empire. The spirit of glasnost was nowhere more welcome than in the captive Eastern European countries where free discussion and assembly focused above all on ending Soviet occupation. With a mixture of humanity, courage, and dithering, Gorbachev more or less peacefully acceded power one by one, as the former subject peoples demanded independence. Several subject nations within Russia proper, including Chechnya, did as well, but, other than the Baltic States, none of these were given independence. The successful unraveling also owed much to Gorbachev’s successor Boris Yeltsin’s courageous defeat of the attempted hardliner coup in 1991 and the parliamentary uprising in 1993. Essential to the collapse of the Soviet Union was also the charismatic leadership of President Ronald Reagan, whose decency and rhetoric of freedom were combined with toughness and steadfastness. Reagan’s resounding phrases worked their way into the minds of Eastern European subjects, Soviet peoples, and, not least, Gorbachev himself.

The Soviets could not withstand the expense of trying to keep up with Reagan’s military investment. Nor could they come close to matching such U.S. military technology as anti-missile defense and submarine-detection systems. Held at bay for decades by nuclear deterrence and concerted global resistance, the USSR finally crumbled from within, bringing an end to the Cold War. The United States and its close allies, possessing the world’s most thoroughly market-driven economies, were also the most innovative and wealthiest countries and hence, all else equal, those best equipped to win long struggles for survival. Global-liberal societies’ economic, military, and moral robustness proved decisive, as it had for their national-liberal predecessors. (The dominant paradigm and society that preceded global liberalism in the United States, those of approximately 1885 to 1965, were relatively focused on the nation state and thus national – rather than global-liberal systems).19 Throughout the Soviet period, the USSR was a segmentary, tribal, plural state much like Austro-Hungary had been. Even as the Soviet Union engaged in brutal suppression, it prided itself in being made up of autonomous national cultures. When strongly identifying ethnic groups are also highly regionalized, as Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, and others were within the Soviet Union, a country is not merely weakened but in danger of disintegration when in crisis. For the longing of ethnic groups to participate with their fellows is difficult to stop, short of the use of overwhelming force. Such an unnatural political union as the USSR is hard to keep together. Had the Soviets used their absolute power to systematically Under President George H. W. Bush, the United States undertook the First Iraq War in 1991 with strong involvement of the UN and the participation of many countries. The United States and its allies implemented General Colin Powell’s doctrine of overwhelming force and soon reversed the Iraqi conquest, which without U.S. initiative would have been allowed to stand, but they made no attempt to replace the regime. For a time, the slogan became “the new world order,” the restrained, civilized, collegial, largely uncontested, post-Cold War projection of a peaceful, liberal world under the leadership of the United States. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia began to unravel as Slobodan Milošević’s brooding Serbian nationalism turned murderous against successive Balkan national communities as they declared independence.

Bosnia was more problematic because more ethnically split, primarily between Serbians and Muslims, and its Serbian militias began committing genocide against their Muslim neighbors with Milošević’s approval and support. The world outcry against the atrocities was loud and nearly unanimous, but European countries, in their timidity born of collective guilt over fascism together with half a century of security dependence on the United States, were unable to bring themselves to halt it. Year after year the genocide went on amid barrages of denunciation and innumerable resolutions, but the Europeans would not act. Bush lent moral support and encouraged them to do their share and take responsibility for the problem in their own backyard, but he kept the United States out of the Balkans. President Bill Clinton at first continued Bush’s policy of aloofness but after continued genocide and European handwringing the United States entered Bosnia in 1994 with European backing and partial UN support to halt the genocide. As another Serbian genocide was under way in Kosovo two years later, and the Europeans were again paralyzed, Clinton at last intervened with a bombing campaign to stop Serbia’s war crimes. U.S. engagement under Clinton with the UN in Bosnia and Kosovo was more hesitant and delayed than it had been under the elder Bush in the Persian Gulf, but it too was consultative, needed, and generally appreciated. An important consequence of the collapse of the USSR was that India, which had long been cozy with the Soviets, out of lingering colonial resentment toward Great Britain and Jawaharlal Nehru’s genteel sympathy for hierarchy, began concerted liberalization and realignment and became an increasingly important member of the world community. The imminent threat to India, whose interests and inclinations lay entirely in peaceful relations with its neighbors and the world, was from Pakistan, bitter internecine struggle having resulted in partition at the very moment of India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947. Pakistan claimed all of predominantly Muslim Kashmir and has directed aggression against India throughout the more than seven decades since their independence, waging four wars and an ongoing campaign of terrorism over the contested province.

As Deng-regime China developed rapidly over the later decades of the global era, it increasingly posed the most serious threat to India as well as to the Pax Americana. China allowed considerable play to economic markets under the new regime – much more than did Maoist China or the USSR – but its markets remained predominantly under the direction of the state and conducted for purposes of the regime and its cronies. Its profile had much in common with that of imperial Germany of the hierarchical societies of the national era. As Germany was the rising hierarchical power of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, China was the rising hierarchical power of the late 20th and early 21st. It shared Bismarck’s aim of exploiting the economic markets and strategy of co-opting internal dissent by improving conditions for the population while remaining authoritarian. China also came to share every bit of imperial Germany’s hubris, yet China was totalitarian where the imperial Germany was not. China’s population at the end of the period was just over four times that of the United States and 50 percent greater than that of the West as a whole. The Chinese regime’s single most hostile act toward the world community was the covert passing of nuclear weapons technology and components to Pakistan from the 1980s on. The regime wagered that it was in its interests to help equip Islamic countries with nuclear weapons in their growing contest with the United States and the West. Its intent was that this proliferation would be costly to the United States and its allies, tie them up, and provide the Chinese regime more room within which to maneuver.20 Its intent was also to force the United States to reconfigure defense capabilities away from meeting Chinese conventional war threats and toward addressing Islamic insurgencies. Its further intent was to nudge Pakistan and India toward a nuclear stand-off in the expectation that a beleaguered India would be a less substantial counterweight to China. The Chinese rulers calculated that the gargantuan costs and risks of their ghastly, negative-sum action would be borne disproportionately by other countries, leaving China comparatively stronger. Pakistani and, potentially, Iranian nuclear weapons (the latter partly proliferated from Pakistan) posed major threats to everyone in the world, the Chinese people included, but the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:4:74f2d3b79ee1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1194, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Its further intent was to nudge Pakistan and India toward a nuclear stand-off in the expectation that a beleaguered India would be a less substantial counterweight to China.

Pakistani and, potentially, Iranian nuclear weapons (the latter partly proliferated from Pakistan) posed major threats to everyone in the world, the Chinese people included, but the regime banked that given their well-known resolve, numbers, tight controls, and geographical insularity, these weapons would be less likely to be directed toward them than toward others. China deliberately created the nuclear proliferation that occupied a good deal of the rest of the world’s international attention and resources. This strategic move was vintage Deng Xiaoping in its abstruse brilliance. The proliferation was also sufficiently secret and advanced in time from the threat that it fell within Deng’s slogan, “Hide our claws.” That such proliferation would leave China stronger vis-à-vis the world, at least for a time, is likely correct, but note the reference behind the decision. This action greatly harmed China’s true and lasting national interests. Who is to say that a nuclear war between Pakistan and India would not devastate China as well? Trolling in nuclear chaos could make sense only to a threatened elite within the Chinese Communist Party possessing doubtful popular acceptance, whose legacy of machinations haunts China and the world. The decision to proliferate in such a manner speaks more reliably about who the Chinese rulers are than decades of official statements.21 Where Deng-regime China was, until recently, for the most part pragmatic, North Korea was an erratic rogue state. From the Korean War on, the regime has stewed in its poisonous juices, glowered across the demilitarized zone, and intermittently taken hostile action against the South, all the while building up its military and cruelly exploiting its people. North Korea undertook extremely costly nuclear weapons development even as its perennial agricultural crisis resulted in widespread starvation. Learning more about this program in 1993 than it wanted to know, the Clinton administration pressured and bribed the North Korean regime into signing a formal accord with the United States and allowing inspections, whereupon the regime went underground with its program. When the deception was discovered by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 and was soon after admitted, North Korea summarily expelled the inspectors. Already committed in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bush did nothing. Seeking to intimidate at every turn, the Kim Jong-un regime’s nature has long been abundantly apparent.22 Despite Russia’s promising change of regime and withdrawal from much of its empire, hopes for a new world order were largely dashed over the next decade.

Russia continued to possess a formidable military, including a nuclear arsenal second only to that of the United States, and its turbulent experiment with pseudo-democratic reform under Boris Yeltsin soon proved unserious. The Russian regime once again became fully authoritarian after Vladimir Putin was elected president in 2000, and the country again began presenting problems to the world community increasingly comparable to those the USSR had presented. Russia once more began menacing its neighbors. Putin’s aggression began on a relatively small scale and was carried out surreptitiously for the most part as it occupied two provinces of Georgia and one of Moldova. Putin attempted to assassinate Ukraine’s Reform President Viktor Yuschenko with dioxin poisoning in 2004. He may also have murdered Polish President Lech Kaczynski and much of his administration in 2010 by causing their plane to crash while attempting to land in Russia. Putin’s covert interference with and corruption of the new regimes of the former Soviet republics and dependencies undermined autonomy and set back development in them. Muslims were partly in denial of and partly awed and confounded by the West’s stupendous military and technological achievements during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, as were third-world peoples almost everywhere. Muslims were also revolted and embarrassed by those accomplishments. By the middle decades of the national era, they began looking to Westernizers like Mustafa Ataturk and Gamal Nasser. The most prominent Islamic figures of the early decades of the global era instead sought inspiration and strength in their own tradition. Many young Muslims were receptive to new Islamist forms (i.e., those of totalitarian political Islam) that were developing in Cairo, Damascus, and other centers during the 1950s and early 1960s, particularly around the Muslim Brotherhood. Decades in the making, the Islamist movement began coming into its own during the late 1960s and 1970s in the Middle East. The Islamic Resurgence, the strengthening of Muslim tradition and aggressive resistance to difference, particularly women’s rights, increasingly pronounced since the late 1960s, has presented a many-sided Muslim counter-paradigm diametrically opposed to global liberalism (although there has been important variation in it from country to country). The Islamic Resurgence has been predominantly Islamist, presenting a hardening of Muslim societies’ perennial authoritarianism into militancy and totalitarianism. Accordingly, much of the Islamic world has remained strikingly insular and highly intolerant of other traditions, and it has posed threats to non-Muslim societies in many parts of the world.

Accordingly, much of the Islamic world has remained strikingly insular and highly intolerant of other traditions, and it has posed threats to non-Muslim societies in many parts of the world. Distantly analogous to the rise of fundamentalist Christianity in the United States and many third-world countries, the Islamic Resurgence has been associated with the institutionalization and spread of moral and religious discipline in an effort to restore sociocultural coherence to personal and communal life. But the Islamic movement entails a strongly collectivist, outward political thrust almost entirely absent in Christianity. Moreover, where Christian fundamentalism has lain outside of and resisted many aspects of the dominant global-liberal paradigm, the Islamic Resurgence has been paradigmatic in the Muslim world since the mid-1960s. Bound up with the Islamic Resurgence, a double crescent of conflict containing most of the world’s trouble spots has described the boundaries between Islam and its neighbors in Asia, Europe, and Africa, extending from Mindanao through portions of Indonesia, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Xinjiang, Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Sudan, Nigeria, Mali, and beyond. Under the Islamic Resurgence, most fundamentalist Muslims in particular have shown neither respect nor tolerance for their neighbors, “infidels” toward whom they feel morally superior and bear accumulated resentments. Large numbers of putatively moderate Muslims everywhere have supported their highly intolerant coreligionists in spirit and with resources. Along many of their frontiers, notably in equatorial Africa, Muslims have been gaining ground through migration, fertility, aggression, terror, and pressured conversion. Many Muslim regimes, in their ambivalent simultaneous admiration for and fear of fundamentalism have encouraged or tolerated Islamist militias, leaving confused sovereignty and porous borders. They have used such non-state actors ambiguously to simultaneously allow and cover internal and external aggression from safe havens. Like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hezbollah, al Qaeda and ISIS have been Islamist militias, only much more ambitious and far-reaching than the others. In Israel, the Islamic Resurgence has met with what has appeared to be its nemesis, the adjacent small, prosperous, liberal, Western country that has received the brunt of its wrath but is not going to be intimidated by anyone into yielding its security, although the Jewish state would be a partner to a just and lasting peace which guaranteed its national security. Given the frame of mind accompanying the Islamic Resurgence, Israel’s great strength and success have enraged Muslim populations, as has U.S. support of it. Islam being a highly political religion, the umma, the community of all Muslims, is of supreme importance to it.23 The Islamic Resurgence has manifested strong nationalism from the beginning, only oriented toward the umma rather than the nation-state.24 Muslims have taken Israel’s very existence as an unacceptable travesty.

An Islamic Resurgence would have occurred in any event, but the Arab-Israeli conflict has further inflamed what might otherwise have been less radical and xenophobic. The surface challenge to the world community has been to help assure Israel’s security while offering the Palestinians land and statehood. Such a problem would appear to be ready-made for solution via side-payments, reparations, border adjustments, good fences, some UN troops, an end to detached settlements, and a Palestinian capitol in East Jerusalem – but it is not. Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered such an agreement to the Palestinians in 2000, and Yasser Arafat rejected it. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered slightly more in 2008, and Mahmoud Abbas rejected it. The fundamental problem is that neither the Palestinians nor the vast majority of other Muslims have been ready to accept a non-Muslim state in their midst. Reconciliation of the Arab-Israeli conflict has foundered on the spirit of the times in the Muslim world. The Islamic Resurgence has been radical and nationalist partly because of the strength of communal ties to Islam as a whole but also partly because of the cynical efforts of Muslim rulers, particularly oil producers like the Saudis, to deflect anger away from their own authoritarian regimes. For a time, the Islamic Resurgence seemed to pose the great threat toward these regimes. But many Muslim ruling classes of the global era like many before them, Muslim and non-Muslim, consciously employed nationalism to redirect popular anger outward in order to stymie its natural, inward, expression. Stoking nationalism to distract Egyptians from domestic economic and political issues was the modus operandi of the Mubarak regime for decades. Israel has been the Muslim autocracies’ all-purpose enemy, although as the United States was drawn into the region, it too increasingly became a target. Nor, mixing fervor and cynicism, have most of the corrupt rulers been impervious to the charismatic radicals’ nationalist appeal, so long as their regimes’ interests have been secure. While throttling dissent at home, the tyrants long privately chortled at the Islamist gains and U.S. difficulties abroad.

His al Qaeda terrorist campaign and especially his spectacular strike on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001 successfully shifted some Muslim rage from Israel toward the United States and the West, intensifying the Islamist insurgency against the Pax Americana. Bin Laden’s influence was considerable in Pakistan before he was killed in May of 2011 in his regime-provided sanctuary. After 9/11 the United States under President George W. Bush invaded Afghanistan in early 2002 with the support of the allies to depose the Taliban regime that had harbored the terrorists. Bush replaced it with a formally democratic but duplicitous, corrupt, and ineffectual regime under Hamid Karzai that he half-heartedly sought to strengthen with a program of institution building. While the Taliban-dominated insurgency simmered at a relatively low level during its early years with its top command protected in Pakistan, the U.S. president redirected his attention to Iraq where Saddam Hussein was busy being his provocative self though providing a necessary counterweight to Iran and doing so without threatening vital American international security interests. Still possessing considerable public support soon after 9/11, George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 and quickly destroyed Hussein’s regime, only to face stubborn guerrilla resistance. A follow-up effort led by General David Petraeus during the surge of 2007 and 2008 was at last able to install a partially democratic successor regime that showed some early vitality. Expensive, poorly conceived, conducted and justified, and bearing multiple unfortunate side effects, the Iraq War dragged on for eight years. President Barack Obama scaled down troop strength in Iraq, and significant U.S. combat operations ceased there in late 2011. As the United The Arab Spring that began in December of 2010 presented what might have been a hopeful new direction for the Islamic Resurgence. Beginning with Tunisia’s democratic uprising and going on to those of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and other countries, the movement initially brought degrees of self-determination to a few once entirely hierarchical Arab countries in the face of cruel resistance from tyrannical ruling classes, but the activists were turned back everywhere except in Tunisia. The courageous and inspired, mostly young people who supported democratization struggled with intelligence and pride to shunt aside those herding, fleecing, and stifling them. They made beginnings toward throwing off their shackles and instituting much-needed economic, political, social, and cultural reforms, but their cause awaited another day.

The true nemesis of the Islamic Resurgence was neither Israel nor the West; it was the extent to which Muslim publics were susceptible to diversion by radical nationalism. This in turn has been substantially conditioned by the hierarchical origins and history of Islam. Hopes for Arab Spring-like liberalization or for Middle Eastern peace are likely to remain unfulfilled until Muslims find within themselves the resources with which to critique their tradition and extend humanity to their neighbors. The Pax Americana was fairly effective overall in deterring outright invasion around the world from 1945 through 2012. Public support was relatively strong in advanced liberal countries for halting overt aggression between states, at least insofar as the stakes were high and remedies practicable. In response to clear-cut security threats, global-liberal voting publics, when led by the United States, were usually willing and able to isolate economically and politically, or if necessary turn back by force, any country that would challenge global harmony in such an egregious manner, although they occasionally looked the other way when preoccupied by more pressing concerns. The security regime was less effective in countering insurgencies, which tend to be drawn out and ambiguous, but those too have been reversed when sufficiently threatening to the liberal world order. Although shaken by 9/11, the Pax Americana seemed to face less menacing threats than the Soviet Union had posed, and it remained relatively low key through the George W. Bush and first Obama administrations. Another dangerous phase of the Pax Americana arrived when Presi-dent Obama partially suspended U.S. international leadership and ways of treating international friends and foes. For example, after Poland had gone out on a political limb at the request of the United States in 2008 and accepted NATO anti-ballistic missiles to protect Europe from the threat of Iranian nuclear missiles, he unceremoniously dropped the plans during his first year in office. He snubbed any number of allied leaders the same year. Two years later, at the urging of Britain and France, he unwisely participated in NATO air strikes that enabled Arab-Spring rebels to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that country to slip into chaos. Obama showed disquieting animus toward Israel from the onset. While repeatedly disappointing U.S. allies, he reached out to adversaries of the security regime, as in his “resetting” of relations with Russia and Iran.

Obama conveyed the impression to opponents of the security regime that he was not oriented toward forcefully restraining their aggression.25 U.S. international policy was sufficiently out of character during the first Obama administration that it took the major authoritarian powers four years of experience with it before they would allow themselves to believe that a partial caesura had occurred in the Pax Americana. They began exploiting the opportunity during the second Obama administration, moving into the vacuum created by its ambivalence and inaction to forcibly extend control over land, sea, and airspace belonging to their neighbors or the world, albeit cautiously with the exception of ISIS. Once its adversaries understood that the Pax Americana was partially suspended, they began encroaching upon the liberal world order, first by seeking to establish and progressively enlarge regional spheres of influence. Accordingly, China restructured its ruling class with a more forward presence of the Red Army under Xi Jinping on November 15, 2012 immediately following the U.S. presidential election. Its bid was under way to exclude U.S. and allied military power from the western Pacific. Insofar as this campaign was successful, it would absorb Taiwan and Finlandize or turn other traditional U.S. allies in the area, including South Korea and Japan. The more of its program China achieved, the greater its momentum would be and the more dangerous and costly the eventual containment of or conflict with it. While rapidly building up its military amid great secrecy, the Chinese regime began increasingly bullying India and other neighbors over arbitrary territorial claims. In early 2013 it sharply intensified its efforts to extend control over the Spratly Islands and most of the South and East China Seas, to which several other countries had valid claims in international law, but it did not. China created artificial islands in the Spratlys 660 miles from the mainland and 210 miles from the Philippines, building military airfields on several of them. At stake were airspace, surface transportation, fishing, and seabed resource rights that included large undersea petroleum reserves. The regime also began pushing with increased force and bluster to annex Taiwan, on Beijing’s terms. It did so against the agreement between the United States and China signed by Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972, under which relations between the two countries were normalized.

It did so against the agreement between the United States and China signed by Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972, under which relations between the two countries were normalized. That agreement grounds the understanding in effect between the world community and China regarding Taiwan: There is one China, Taiwan is part of China, and it will one day be reincorporated into China, but only by peaceful means and with the agreement of Taiwan. The agreement provided for transfer of the permanent U.N. Security Council seat from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People’s Republic, in return for China’s acceptance of normalization. China was sowing hatred of the West and Japan and whipping up nationalism for popular support while beginning to expand territorially. Following Obama’s reset with it, Putin’s Russia invaded and occupied Crimea in early 2014. Soon after, amid a massive disinformation campaign, it invaded additional territory in eastern and southern Ukraine while paying and/or coercing Russian-speaking locals to join, providing some cover for what it was doing. Russia consolidated control of the occupied portions of Ukraine during 2015. Its conquests in Ukraine were the first open invasion of a sovereign European nation since World Iran responded to the reset with it by continued extension of influence in the Middle East, sponsorship of terrorism, and development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That country consolidated its control in Lebanon and Syria, increased its control in Iraq and supported the Houthi takeover of Yemen. The United States and Europe reached a controversial nuclear weapons accord with Iran in 2015 that postponed but did not bar it’s becoming a nuclear power. ISIS or the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq, the home base of which was Anbar province, during the Second Iraq War. Headed by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi from 2010 until 2019, ISIS sent its radical forces to fight in Syria when the Arab-Spring uprising began there in 2011. Known for its barbarous beheadings and smashing of artifacts from earlier civilizations, ISIS was committed to a strategy of holding land and forming an Islamist state, which led to an early break with al Qaeda. After conquering large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, ISIS proclaimed itself the Caliphate in 2014 and began accepting affiliates in numerous countries across the Islamic world from West Africa to the Philippines. The onslaught of ISIS was already under way during Obama’s first term, but most of its territorial gains came during the second. After long resisting military involvement against ISIS, the American president eventually began hesitant, perfunctory", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:12:2aeb60d8b3a1", "wtk_id": NaN}]
