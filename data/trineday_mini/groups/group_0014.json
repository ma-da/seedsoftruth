We contacted him at his Santa Barbara-area home for a report on his journey from mild-mannered scholar to doubting Thomas. How did you join the ranks of those questioning the official account of the 9/11 events? I was rather slow getting on board. **For the first year and a half I just accepted the conventional view, really the blowback thesis, that this was blowback for our foreign policy.** When a colleague suggested to me about a year after 9/11 that he was convinced our own government or forces within our own government had arranged it, I didn't accept that. Then several months later another colleague sent me [a link to] [a website](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up) that had a timeline. **Once I started reading that and saw all those stories drawn from mainstream sources that contradicted the official account, I decided I needed to look into it more carefully, and the more I looked, the worse it got.** I considered it an obligation to kind of organize, compile the evidence and put it out there for the public. The Internet is full of 9/11 conspiracy theories. What have you contributed to the discussion? My main contribution has been the second book, [showing] that the 9/11 commission report is not worthy of belief, and the implication of that is that they were covering up the government's own guilt. What would constitute a \"smoking gun\" against the official 9/11 account? There are many. By just ignoring them, the 9/11 commission implicitly admitted they couldn't answer them. The [towers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#wtcinvestigation) coming down into a pile only a few stories high is a smoking gun. Many laws of physics had to be violated if the official story about [the collapses](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#wtcinvestigation2) is true. [The collapses] had all the earmarks of a controlled demolition by explosives. One of those is total collapse into a small pile of rubble. **The fact that [Building 7](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#wtcinvestigation3) [a skyscraper near the towers] collapsed when it had not been hit by an airplane, and collapsed in seven or eight seconds, that's a smoking gun.

I can't say one is bigger than the other. You've got six or seven that are equally big. Critics of the official 9/11 account seem to draw sinister inferences from instances where people, buildings or physical objects didn't react or behave as one might expect in theory. For example, if the hijackers were [devout Muslims](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#lap), why were some drinking, eating pork chops and cavorting with lap dancers? Doesn't real life unfold inconsistently, even bizarrely? That's true, but **the 9/11 commission simply ignored those questions. They're creating this image of fanatics who were so devout and convinced of the truth of their religion that they were ready to meet their maker, yet here's all this evidence that suggests they were not devout at all.** [The commission] simply ignored evidence. Dissenters also seem to find it suspect that in a dire emergency, individuals and agencies bumbled, fumbled, delayed, dropped the ball or choked. Won't that occur in any emergency? Well, of course, that is the official theory. It's a coincidence theory that just happened to be that on those days, everybody became terribly incompetent. Take the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration]. They've got these standard procedures: If a plane goes off course, if you lose radio contact or lose the transponder, you call the military. On this day we're told these FAA officials hit the trifecta. They got all three of these things, and yet they would stand around debating, \"Should we call the military? No, I don't think so.\" And when they finally call, the people at headquarters won't accept their calls because they were in conference or wouldn't pass the call on. They have roughly about 100 hijack warnings a year where planes have to be scrambled, but suddenly they become just all thumbs. The whole thing is just implausible. The other thing is, **if you've got accidents, screw-ups, some ought to go one way and the others the other way. Here everything goes the same way.

What would motivate such a scenario? You've got liberal Democrats and Republicans and Independents who are appalled by what Andrew Bacevich [a professor of international relations at Boston University] called \"the new American militarism\" in the book \"American Empire.\" New meaning, qualitatively different than before. This post-9/11 push to a new level has made the world an enormously more dangerous place. Many people apart from thinking about 9/11 as an inside job have decided that the United States is doing what [Princeton University emeritus international law professor] Richard Falk calls a \"[global domination project](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#pnac).\" Chalmers Johnson [Japan Policy Research Institute president], a previous conservative, now says that we have become a military juggernaut intent on world domination. Have you followed polls on what the public believes about 9/11? **There was a [Zogby poll](https://www.WantToKnow.info/zogby911) in New York. The question asked was, do you believe the government had advance knowledge of the attacks and consciously let them happen? Forty-nine percent in New York City said yes.** I believe it was 43% statewide. That is a pretty remarkable figure. In this country there has not been a poll that asked, do you believe the government actually planned and orchestrated the attacks? The question has been raised in Europe and Canada and has gotten to somewhere around 20%. It would be interesting to have such a poll in the United States. Conspiracy theorists are often dismissed as marginal types. Where do your views on 9/11 place you in the eyes of your peers in academia? One thing to point out is, the official account itself is a conspiracy theory. It says that 19 Arab Muslims under the influence of Osama bin Laden conspired to pull off this operation. The question is not whether one is a conspiracy theorist about 9/11. It's which conspiracy theory do you find most supported by the evidence? Does your role as a 9/11 dissenter depart from your life's work as a scholar and theologian? At first glance it may seem strange, but the task of a theologian is to look at the world from what we would imagine the divine perspective, [which] would care about the good of the whole and would love all the parts. [So] 9/11, if it was brought about by forces within our own government for imperial reasons, is antithetical to the general good. Evil has been a subject of your academic writing.

[So] 9/11, if it was brought about by forces within our own government for imperial reasons, is antithetical to the general good. Evil has been a subject of your academic writing. It's also been a recurring theme in administration rhetoric. Is that strange? In these politicians' mouths, it's used to describe certain groups and organizations when it's politically convenient to do so, and then to overlook even greater evil when it's politically convenient to do so. **If you understand the divine as an all-powerful and wrathful creator who seeks vengeance, and uses overwhelming power to destroy its enemies, why then, if you've got the political power, you're probably going to think you're acting like God if you do that.** The [Christian] church during the early centuries was anti-empire. Rome was the enemy. With Constantine, the empire accepted Christianity, and Christianity started accepting empire and all that entailed. There has been a long history of support for militarism, so from that perspective, it's not so strange. Prior to your 9/11 work, did you have an anti-establishment streak? I never burned my bra. I was fairly critical like a lot of Americans are, but I don't think people would have looked at me and said, \"There's an anti-establishment guy.\" Do you get hate mail? I've had a few people suggest I need to see a psychiatrist, and one psychiatrist in L.A. even kindly offered his services. **For more reliable 9/11 conspiracy information: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information)** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

From the president to passersby on the streets, the message seems to be the same: this is an inexplicable assault on freedom and democracy, which must be answered with overwhelming force -- just as soon as someone can construct a credible account of who was actually responsible. Shock, rage and grief there has been aplenty. But any glimmer of recognition of why people might have been driven to carry out such atrocities, sacrificing their own lives in the process -- or why the United States is hated with such bitterness, not only in Arab and Muslim countries, but across the developing world -- seems almost entirely absent. Perhaps it is too much to hope that, as rescue workers struggle to pull firefighters from the rubble, any but a small minority might make the connection between what has been visited upon them and what their government has visited upon large parts of the world. But make that connection they must, if such tragedies are not to be repeated, potentially with even more devastating consequences. US political leaders are doing their people no favours by reinforcing popular ignorance with self-referential rhetoric. And the echoing chorus of Tony Blair, whose determination to bind Britain ever closer to US foreign policy ratchets up the threat to our own cities, will only fuel anti-western sentiment. So will calls for the defence of \"civilisation,\" with its overtones of Samuel Huntington's poisonous theories of post-cold war confrontation between the West and Islam, heightening perceptions of racism and hypocrisy.

Since George Bush's father inaugurated his new world order a decade ago, the US, supported by its British ally, bestrides the world like a colossus. Unconstrained by any superpower rival or system of global governance, the US giant has rewritten the global financial and trading system in its own interest; ripped up a string of treaties it finds inconvenient; sent troops to every corner of the globe; bombed Afghanistan, Sudan, Yugoslavia and Iraq without troubling the United Nations; maintained a string of murderous embargoes against recalcitrant regimes; and recklessly thrown its weight behind Israel's 34-year illegal military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as the Palestinian intifada rages. It is this record of unabashed national egotism and arrogance that drives anti-Americanism among swaths of the world's population, for whom there is little democracy in the current distribution of global wealth and power. If it turns out that Tuesday's attacks were the work of Osama bin Laden's supporters, the sense that the Americans are once again reaping a dragons' teeth harvest they themselves sowed will be overwhelming. It was the Americans, after all, who poured resources into the 1980s war against the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, at a time when girls could go to school and women to work. Bin Laden and his mojahedin were armed and trained by the CIA and MI6, as Afghanistan was turned into a wasteland and its communist leader Najibullah left hanging from a Kabul lamp post with his genitals stuffed in his mouth. But by then Bin Laden had turned against his American sponsors, while US-sponsored Pakistani intelligence had spawned the grotesque Taliban now protecting him. To punish its wayward Afghan offspring, the US subsequently forced through a sanctions regime which has helped push 4 million to the brink of starvation, according to the latest UN figures, while Afghan refugees fan out across the world. All this must doubtless seem remote to Americans desperately searching the debris of what is expected to be the largest-ever massacre on US soil -- as must the killings of yet more Palestinians in the West Bank yesterday, or even the 2 million estimated to have died in Congo's wars since the overthrow of the US-backed Mobutu regime. \"What could some political thing have to do with blowing up office buildings during working hours?\" one bewildered New Yorker asked yesterday.

NEW YORK, Aug. 24, 1998 At the CIA, it happens often enough to have a code name: Blowback. Simply defined, this is the term that describes an agent, an operative or an operation that has turned on its creators. Osama bin Laden, our new public enemy Number 1, is the personification of blowback. And the fact that he is viewed as a hero by millions in the Islamic world proves again the old adage: Reap what you sow. BEFORE YOU CLICK on my face and call me naive, let me concede some points. Yes, the West needed Josef Stalin to defeat Hitler. Yes, there were times during the Cold War when supporting one villain (Cambodias Lon Nol, for instance) would have been better than the alternative (Pol Pot). So yes, there are times when any nation must hold its nose and shake hands with the devil for the long-term good of the planet. But just as surely, there are times when the United States, faced with such moral dilemmas, should have resisted the temptation to act. Arming a multi-national coalition of Islamic extremists in Afghanistan during the 1980s - well after the destruction of the Marine barracks in Beirut or the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - was one of those times. BIN LADENS BEGINNINGS As anyone who has bothered to read this far certainly knows by now, bin Laden is the heir to Saudi construction fortune who, at least since the early 1990s, has used that money to finance countless attacks on U.S. interests and those of its Arab allies around the world. Osama bin Ladens network As his unclassified CIA biography states, bin Laden left Saudi Arabia to fight the Soviet army in Afghanistan after Moscows invasion in 1979. By 1984, he was running a front organization known as Maktab al-Khidamar the MAK - which funneled money, arms and fighters from the outside world into the Afghan war. What the CIA bio conveniently fails to specify (in its unclassified form, at least) is that the MAK was nurtured by Pakistans state security services, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911docs.txt:3:389e55437657", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8441, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911docs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911docs", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "unclassified CIA biography states, bin Laden left Saudi Arabia to fight the Soviet army in Afghanistan after Moscows invasion in 1979. By 1984, he was running a front organization known as Maktab al-Khidamar the MAK - which funneled money, arms and fighters from the outside world into the Afghan war. What the CIA bio conveniently fails to specify (in its unclassified form, at least) is that the MAK was nurtured by Pakistans state security services, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, the CIAs primary conduit for conducting the covert war against Moscows occupation. By no means was Osama bin Laden the leader of Afghanistans mujahedeen. His money gave him undue prominence in the Afghan struggle, but the vast majority of those who fought and died for Afghanistans freedom - like the Taliban regime that now holds sway over most of that tortured nation - were Afghan nationals. Yet the CIA, concerned about the factionalism of Afghanistan made famous by Rudyard Kipling, found that Arab zealots who flocked to aid the Afghans were easier to read than the rivalry-ridden natives. While the Arab volunteers might well prove troublesome later, the agency reasoned, they at least were one-dimensionally anti-Soviet for now. So bin Laden, along with a small group of Islamic militants from Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian refugee camps all over the Middle East, became the reliable partners of the CIA in its war against Moscow. WHATS INTELLIGENT ABOUT THIS? Though he has come to represent all that went wrong with the CIAs reckless strategy there, by the end of the Afghan war in 1989, bin Laden was still viewed by the agency as something of a dilettante - a rich Saudi boy gone to war and welcomed home by the Saudi monarchy he so hated as something of a hero. AMERICA STRIKES BACK In fact, while he returned to his familys construction business, bin Laden had split from the relatively conventional MAK in 1988 and established a new group, al-Qaida, that included many of the more extreme MAK members he had met in Afghanistan. Most of these Afghan vets, or Afghanis, as the Arabs who fought there became known, turned up later behind violent Islamic movements around the world. Among them: the GIA in Algeria, thought responsible for the massacres of tens of thousands of civilians; Egypts Gamat Ismalia, which has massacred western tourists repeatedly in recent years; Saudi Arabia Shiite militants, responsible for the Khobar Towers and Riyadh bombings of 1996. Indeed, to this day, those involved in the decision to give the Afghan rebels access to a fortune in covert funding and top-level combat weaponry continue to defend that move in the context of the Cold War. Senator Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee making those decisions, told my colleague Robert Windrem that he would make the same call again today even knowing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911docs.txt:4:f128decea44c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8442, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911docs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911docs", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Arabia Shiite militants, responsible for the Khobar Towers and Riyadh bombings of 1996.

Senator Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee making those decisions, told my colleague Robert Windrem that he would make the same call again today even knowing what bin Laden would do subsequently. It was worth it, he said. Those were very important, pivotal matters that played an important role in the downfall of the Soviet Union, he said. HINDSIGHT OR TUNNEL VISION It should be pointed out that the evidence of bin Ladens connection to these activities is mostly classified, though its hard to imagine the CIA rushing to take credit for a Frankensteins monster like this. It is also worth acknowledging that it is easier now to oppose the CIAs Afghan adventures than it was when Hatch and company made them in the mid-1980s. After all, in 1998 we now know that far larger elements than Afghanistan were corroding the communist partys grip on power in Moscow. Even Hatch cant be blamed completely. The CIA, ever mindful of the need to justify its mission, had conclusive evidence by the mid-1980s of the deepening crisis of infrastructure within the Soviet Union. The CIA, assist. deputy director William Gates acknowledged under congressional questioning in 1992, had decided to keep that evidence from President Reagan and his top advisors and instead continued to grossly exaggerate Soviet military and technological capabilities in its annual Soviet Military Power report right up to 1990. Given that context, a decision was made to provide Americas potential enemies with the arms, money - and most importantly the knowledge of how to run a war of attrition violent and well-organized enough to humble a superpower. That decision is coming home to roost.

It is only 60 miles to New York City and I am having trouble keeping my eyes open. I had just pulled off the road in Allentown, PA, to throw some cold water in my face. Kathleen and I have grown very silent. It is the dread of what is ahead.

As we cross the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan, the plume of smoke from the lower part of the island hovers, bright blasting searchlights attempting to crash through it. The college radio station from Fordham is playing Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall.\" Instead of making the turn south to go home down the West Side Highway, I go north and head toward the town where our daughter goes to college. It is one in the morning, and when we arrive on campus we note that every single light in the dorms is on (when do these kids sleep?). We call Natalie and tell her we have made it home. She directs us to the nearest gate where she is with some other young women who are working on the school paper. We pull up, she comes out... and this is, as it always has been, the happiest moment of our lives. We hug her, and hug her again. She is happy to see us, and she generously, good-naturedly, tolerates our weepy parental doting. She is, after all, the only reason we have made this drive. Nothing else matters at this point. We eventually leave her to her own life and head toward New York City. It is now deep in the middle of the night and the radio plays \"O Superman\" by Laurie Anderson (\"Here come the planes -- they're American planes!... hold me in your arms... your military arms...\") and then the DJ says that he is going to play a song that they have never let him play before on the station. What an odd thing to announce, I think, considering we live in a free country where you can play whatever music you damn well please. I recall the email I received the night before from a radio station manager in Michigan. He passed on to me a confidential memo from the radio conglomerate that owns his station: Clear Channel, the company that has bought up 1,200 stations altogether -- 247 of them in the nation's 250 largest radio markets -- and that not only dominates the Top 40 format, but controls 60% of all rock-radio listening. The company has ordered its stations not to play a list of 150 songs during this \"national emergency.\" The list, incredibly, includes \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Peace Train,\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine.\" Rah-rah war songs, though, are OK. And then there was this troubling instruction: \"No songs by Rage Against the Machine should be aired.\" The entire works of a band are banned? Is this the freedom we fight for? Or does this sound like one of those repressive dictatorships we are told", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911docs.txt:6:fd56af5a524d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8444, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911docs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911docs", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "ordered its stations not to play a list of 150 songs during this \"national emergency.\" The list, incredibly, includes \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Peace Train,\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine.\" Rah-rah war songs, though, are OK.

Or does this sound like one of those repressive dictatorships we are told is our new enemy? The song the college DJ goes ahead and plays is, \"Hey, War Pig,\" by Katrina and the Waves, and he dedicates it to the \"all the war mongers out there.\" Yes, there is hope, the kids are all right. We arrive at our apartment building and I am too tired to drop the vehicle off at the rental car place, so we unload, head upstairs, and hit the sack. I awake at noon. A horrible stench has filled the apartment. I did not notice it a few hours earlier, but the winds have shifted. It is the odor others had warned me about. It is a smell I have never smelled. I am told by someone in the building that it is a combination of chemicals, rubber, sheetrock, and... he pauses. He does not want to list the final ingredient, and I do not want him to. I thank him and go back upstairs and close all the windows. I look at the cereal box I had left half-opened before our trip to L.A. I stare at this box for a long time. Nine days of ash has descended on the city. It is everywhere, microscopic, invisible, non-discriminatory in where it has landed. No part of the city is untouched, and all are treated equally to the smoke and stench, regardless of station in life. There is no way to turn away and ignore it. I take the rental car back. As I park it, I look across the street and see our neighborhood firehouse consumed in flowers and candles. \"They lost nine firemen,\" the rental woman tells me. \"It's a pretty sad place.\" I cannot go to work. But I have a film to finish. Our editor has been unable to make it in from New Jersey, but he is there now waiting for some word on what to do. I can't even think about this movie. I don't WANT to think about it because if I think about it I will have to face an ugly truth that has been gnawing through my head...

No bomb was set off, no missile was fired, no weapon (i.e., a device that was solely and specifically manufactured to kill humans) was used. A boxcutter! -- I can't stop thinking about this. A thousand gun control laws would not have prevented this massacre. What am I doing? My wife does not want to go down to the memorial to the victims that has spontaneously taken over Union Square in the Village -- she is still in too much shock having returned to this sullen city -- but she encourages me to go, and I do. The Square is filled with hundreds of people. But, more importantly, the walls and fences around Union Square are covered in a blizzard of \"MISSING\" posters of loved ones. Thousands of handbills, flyers, photos, notes all pleading to contact them should anyone know the whereabouts of their mother, father, son, daughter, infant. Yet, all of us who stare at these faces, we know their \"whereabouts.\" And the smoke, the ash, the odor is much thicker down here, just 20 blocks from The Site. The faces of the victims, culled from wedding photos, birthday party home videos, vacation snapshots, are striking in their diversity. Easily, the majority are African-American, Arabic, Hispanic, Asian, Jewish. Their jobs at the World Trade Center are listed. They were clerks, secretaries, janitors, security guards, assistants, dishwashers, waitresses, receptionists -- all the people who HAVE to be at work first thing in the morning, the lower wage workers. The wall is also filled with the faces of brokers, lawyers, managers, accountants, insurance agents -- it is endless, it is everyone, it is America. I am told that there may be over 500 \"illegals\" -- those less-than-minimum wage workers that the commerce of America depends on -- who are also among the dead, but there are no photos of them. Citizens from over 80 countries are victims of this attack and, remarkably, the country that seems to have the most people who were killed is the Muslim country of Pakistan. For two hours I walk through Union Square, listening to the debates that rage in various small circles, between hippies and Army guys, Israelis and Palestinians, those for war and those against. They are heated, passionate --but never do I sense the threat of violence between them. No police are in sight. \"We are self-policed,\" one kid tells me.

Others are singing or rapping, many are quietly crying. As I sit here in the early morning hours of Saturday, September 22, 2001, I cannot untangle much of the past 24 hours. I am exhausted from the trip, from all that has hit me upon returning to New York. I have to unpack eventually. What was it exactly I had packed all these bags for in the first place? Oh, yeah, The Emmys in L.A! Big friggin' deal now, eh? I tick off the list of everything that no longer matters. I watch Bush speak in front of Congress, but I cannot answer him right now, I am tired. The mayor has drastically upped the death toll. My phone rings off the ... whatever phones ring off of these days. Calls from the BBC, CBC, Canal+, ABC (Australia), Swedish TV, Dutch TV -- all want me to appear live on their national primetime newscasts. Not a single American network has called. Frankly, I don't want to be on anybody's TV show no matter where they are from, but I cannot help but feel this sinking feeling in my gut that the rest of the world wants to hear what I have to say, yet in my own country, I am to have no voice in the media (other than through these letters on the Web). This is MY country. I love MY country. Every channel and it's the same damn repetitive drumbeat WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR... And yet, I have just driven 2,944 miles, a drive that began on the corner of Wilshire and the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica, California. I have heard the voices of the scores of fellow Americans I met, the average Joes and Janes, who are NOT screaming WAR WAR WAR! Why can't their voices be heard? Forget about me, I can barely utter a sentence anyway; I don't wanna go on no TV. But where is Noam Chomsky, or Howard Zinn, or the editors of \"The Nation\" or \"Tikkun\" or \"The Progressive\" or the thousands of college kids who protested at noon on Thursday on 148 American campuses? Don't they count? Is this still the America we believe in, the one we are being asked to defend? Coming home tonight, I noticed a strange sound in the city.

I did not hear a single car horn being honked! I have never heard that sound in New York City. No one was yelling, it was quiet and peaceful. I called my dad on my cell phone. He tells me of things getting even worse back home in Flint, the city now bankrupt, the state preparing to take it over. The fire department has had to lay off over 50% of its firefighters. Fires now are just allowed to burn because they have neither the trucks nor the people left to fight them. Then he said, \"Mike, that guy you call 'The Boss' -- he's singing right now on TV!\" The nationwide telethon for the September 11th victims has started. I could hear Bruce Springsteen singing in the background. My father (bless him and his Big Band soul at the age of 80!) knows how much I love Bruce and says, \"let me hold the phone up close to the set so you can hear him,\" and he does, and I hear Springsteen sing these haunting words: \"My city is in ruins, my city is in ruins... c'mon, rise up!\" I love my dad and my mom, my sisters, my wife and my daughter, and I am grateful for this life and for the privilege I've been given to live it with all of them. I come upstairs and Kathleen and I watch the rest of the telethon. Neil Young appears at one point, alone at the piano, and he does not sing one of his own songs. Rather, he sings the banned \"Imagine.\" The Walrus had to have loved that one from where he was watching! Yours, Michael Moore mmflint@aol.com www.michaelmoore.com _____________________________________________________________________________________ Dear Friends and Associates, below is an article I wrote on the current situation. Please pass it along or post if you wish. Larry Mosqueda, Ph.D. The Evergreen State College September 15, 2001 Like all Americans, on Tuesday, 9-11, I was shocked and horrified to watch the WTC Twin Towers attacked by hijacked planes and collapse, resulting in the deaths of perhaps up to 10,000 innocent people. I had not been that shocked and horrified since January 16, 1991, when then President Bush attacked Baghdad, and the rest of Iraq and began killing 200,000 people during that \"war\". This attack included the infamous \"highway of death\" in the last days of the slaughter, when U.S. pilots literally shot in the back retreating Iraqi civilians and soldiers. I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq, which have resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 Iraqis, including over 500,000", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911docs.txt:10:65e4d382632a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8448, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911docs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911docs", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "not been that shocked and horrified since January 16, 1991, when then President Bush attacked Baghdad, and the rest of Iraq and began killing 200,000 people during that \"war\".

I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq, which have resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 Iraqis, including over 500,000 children, about whom former Secretary of State Madeline Albright has stated that their deaths are worth the cost\". Over the course of my life I have been shocked and horrified by a variety of U.S. governmental actions, such as the U.S. sponsored coup against democracy in Guatemala in 1954 which resulted in the deaths of over 120,000 Guatemalan peasants by U.S. installed dictatorships over the course of four decades. Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the horror I felt when the U.S. helped overthrow the government of the Dominican Republic in 1965 and helped to murder 3,000 people. And it reminded me of the shock I felt in 1973, when the U.S. sponsored a coup in Chile against the democratic government of Salvador Allende and helped to murder another 30,000 civilians, including a few U.S. citizens. Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the shock and horror I felt in 1965 when the U.S. supported a coup in Indonesia that resulted in the murder of over 800,000 people, and the subsequent slaughter in 1975 of over 250,000 innocent people in East Timor by the Indonesian regime with the direct complicity of President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terrorist contra war against Nicaragua in the 1980s which resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 innocent people, or as the U.S. government used to call them soft targets (this was before the term \"collateral damage\" was invented). The World Court declared the U.S. government a war criminal in 1984 for the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. I was reminded of being horrified by the U. S. supported war against the people of El Salvador in the 1980s, which resulted in the brutal deaths of over 80,000 \"soft targets. I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terror war against the peoples of southern Africa (especially Angola) that began in the 1970's and continues to this day. This war has resulted in the deaths and mutilations of over 1,000,000. I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt as the U.S. invaded Panama over the Christmas season of 1989 and killed over 8,000 in an attempt to capture George H. Bush's CIA partner, now turned enemy, Manual Noriega.

Bush's CIA partner, now turned enemy, Manual Noriega. I was reminded of the horror I felt when I learned about how the Shah of Iran was installed in a U.S. sponsored brutal coup that resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 Iranians from 1952-1979. And then I was shocked again to later learn that the Ayatollah Khomani, who overthrew the Shah in 1979, and who was the U.S. public enemy for decade of the 1980s, was also on the CIA payroll while he was in exile in Paris in the 1970s. I was reminded of the shock and horror that I felt as I learned about how the U.S. has \"manufactured consent\" since 1948 for its support of Israel. This support and consent virtually denied any rights for the Palestinians to their native lands and has resulted in ever worsening day-to-day conditions for the people of Palestine. I was shocked as I learned about the hundreds of towns and villages that were literally wiped off the face of the earth in the early days of Israeli colonization. I was horrified in1982 as the villagers of Sabra and Shatila were massacred by Israeli allies with direct Israeli complicity and direction. The untold thousands who died that day match the scene of horror that we saw last Tuesday. But those scenes were not repeated over and over again on the national media to inflame the American public. The events and images of last Tuesday have been compared to the horrific events and media images of Lebanon in the 1980s which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousand of people, with no reference to the fact that the country that inflicted that terror on Lebanon was Israel, with U.S. backing. I continue to be shocked at how mainstream commentators refer to \"Israeli settlers\" in the \"occupied territories\" with no sense of irony. Of course, the largest and most shocking war crime of the second half of the 20th century was the U.S. assault on Indochina from 1954-1975, especially Vietnam, where over 4,000,000 people, many of them innocent civilians, were bombed, napalmed, crushed, shot and individually \"hands on\" murdered in the \"Phoenix Program\" (this is where Oliver North got his start). Many U.S. Vietnam veterans were also victimized by this war. They had the best of intentions, while the policy makers knew the criminality of their actions and policies as revealed in their own words in \"The Pentagon Papers,\" released by Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974 Ellsberg noted that our Presidents from Truman to Nixon continually", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911docs.txt:12:3038811d1d76", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8450, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911docs.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911docs", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "of them innocent civilians, were bombed, napalmed, crushed, shot and individually \"hands on\" murdered in the \"Phoenix Program\" (this is where Oliver North got his start).

I was continually shocked and horrified as the U.S. attacked and bombed with impunity the nation of Libya in the 1980s, including killing the infant daughter of Khadafi. I was shocked as the U.S. bombed and invaded Grenada in 1983. I was horrified by U.S. military and CIA actions in Somalia, Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan, Brazil, Argentina, and Yugoslavia. The civilian deaths in these actions ran into the hundreds of thousands. The above list is by no means complete or comprehensive. It is merely a list that is easily accessible and not unknown, especially to the economic and intellectual elites. It has just been conveniently eliminated from the public discourse and public consciousness. And for the most part, the fact that these U.S. actions have resulted in the deaths of primarily civilians (over 90%) is not unknown to these elites and policy makers. A conservative number for those who have been killed by U.S. supported terror and military action since World War II is 8,000,000 people. Repeat--8,000,000 people. This does not include the wounded, the imprisoned, the displaced, the refugees, etc Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in 1967 during the Vietnam War, \"My government is the world's leading purveyor of violence.\" Shocking and horrifying. Nothing that I have written is meant to disparage or disrespect those who were victims and those who suffered death or the loss of a loved one during this week's events. It is not meant to \"justify\" any action by those who bombed the Twin Towers or the Pentagon. It is meant to put it in a context. If we believe that the actions on Sept 11th were those of \"madmen\", then they were \"madmen\" who were able to keep a secret for 2 years or more among over 100 people, as they trained to execute a complex plan. Osama Bin Laden at this point has been accused by the media and the government of being the mastermind of Tuesday's bombings. Given the government's track record on lying to the America people, that should not be accepted as fact at this time. If indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of this action, he is responsible for the deaths of perhaps 10,000 people-a shocking and horrible crime.

If indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of this action, he is responsible for the deaths of perhaps 10,000 people-a shocking and horrible crime. Perhaps most shocking and horrific, if indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of Tuesday's actions; he has clearly had significant training in logistics, armaments, and military training, etc. by competent and expert military personnel, as during the 1980s, he was recruited, trained and funded by the CIA in Afghanistan to fight against the Russians. As long as he visited his terror on Russians and his enemies in Afghanistan, he was \"our man\" in that country. The same is true of Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who was a CIA asset in Iraq during the 1980s. Hussein could gas his own people, repress the population, and invade his neighbor (Iran) as long as he did it with U.S. approval. The same was true of Manuel Noriega of Panama, who was a contemporary and CIA partner of George H. Bush in the 1980s. Noriega's main crime for Bush, the father, was not that he dealt drugs (he did, but the U.S. and Bush knew this before 1989), but that Noriega was no longer going to cooperate in the ongoing U.S. terrorist contra war against Nicaragua. This information is not unknown or really controversial among elite policy makers. To repeat, this not to justify any of the actions of last Tuesday, but rather to put it in its horrifying context. As shocking as the events of last Tuesday were, they are likely to generate even more horrific actions by the U.S. government that will add significantly to the 8,000,000 figure stated above. This response may well be worse than the events of Tuesday. The New York Times headline of 9/14/01 states that, \"Bush And Top Aides Proclaim Policy Of Ending States That Back Terror\" as if that was a rationale, measured, or even sane option. States that have been identified for possible elimination are \"a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, and even Pakistan.\" This is beyond shocking and horrific-it is just as potentially suicidal, homicidal, and more insane than the hijackers themselves. The terror we see is that of desperate and sometimes fanatical groups and individuals who often have legitimate grievances, but engage in individual criminal and illegitimate activities. But the unseen terror is that of \"rational\" educated Western men where the pain, suffering, and deaths of millions of people are contemplated, planned, and too often, executed, for the purpose of furthering a nebulous concept called the \"national interest\".

But the unseen terror is that of \"rational\" educated Western men where the pain, suffering, and deaths of millions of people are contemplated, planned, and too often, executed, for the purpose of furthering a nebulous concept called the \"national interest\". The American public is being prepared for war while being fed a continuous stream of shocking and horrific repeated images of Tuesday's events and heartfelt stories from the survivors and the loved ones of those who lost family members. These stories are real and should not be diminished. In fact, those who lost family members can be considered a representative sample of humanity of the 8,000,000 who have been lost previously. If we multiply by 800 to1000 times the amount of pain, angst, and anger being currently felt by the American public, we might begin to understand how strongly many in the rest of the world feel that they are continually victimized. Those affected, all of us, must do everything in our power to prevent a wider war and even greater atrocity. We must do everything possible to stop the genocide if it starts, and hold responsible those involved for their potential war crimes during and after the war. If there is a great war in 2001 and it is not catastrophic (a real possibility), the crimes of that war will be revisited upon the U.S. over the next generation. This is not some kind of religious prophecy or threat, it is merely my straightforward political analysis. If indeed Bin Laden is responsible, the world must not deal only with him as an individual criminal, but eliminate the conditions that create the injustices and war crimes that will inevitably lead to more of these types of attacks in the future. The phrase \"No Justice, No Peace\" is more than a slogan used in a march, it is an observable historical fact. It is time to end the horror. In a few short pages it is impossible to delineate all of the events described over the past week or to give a comprehensive accounting of U.S. foreign policy.

Did you know that... we supported Bin Laden and the Taliban for years, and viewed them as freedom fighters against the Russians? Isn't that strange? As late as 1998, the US was paying the salary of every single Taliban official in Afghanistan? Isn't that strange? There is more oil and gas in the Caspian Sea area than in Saudi Arabia, but you need a pipeline through Afghanistan to get the oil out. Isn't that strange? UNOCAL, a giant American Oil conglomerate, wanted to build a 1000 mile long pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea. Isn't that strange? UNOCAL spent $10,000,000,000 on geological surveys for pipeline construction, and very nicely courted the Taliban for their support in allowing the construction to begin. Isn't that strange? All of the leading Taliban officials were in Texas negotiating with UNOCAL in 1998. Isn't that strange? 1998-1999 the Taliban changed its mind and threw UNOCAL out of the country and awarded the pipeline project to a company from Argentina. Isn't that strange? John Maresca VP of UNOCAL testified before Congress and said no pipeline until the Taliban was gone and a more friendly government was established. Isn't that strange? 1999-2000 The Taliban became the most evil people in the world. Isn't that strange? Senior American officials in mid-July told Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October. Isn't that strange? 9/11 WTC disaster... Bush goes to war against Afghanistan even though none of the hijackers came from Afghanistan. Isn't that strange? Bush blamed Bin Laden but has never offered any proof saying it's a \"secret\". Isn't that strange? Taliban offered to negotiate to turn over Bin Laden if we showed them some proof. We refused; we bombed. Isn't that strange? Bush said: \"This is not about nation building. It's about getting the terrorists.\" Isn't that strange? We have a new government in Afghanistan. Isn't that strange? The leader of that government formerly worked for UNOCAL. Isn't that strange? Bush appoints a special envoy to represent the US to deal with that new government, who formerly was the \"chief consultant to UNOCAL\". Isn't that strange?

Isn't that strange? Chevron named one of its newest \"supertankers\" after Condoleezza. Isn't that strange? Dick Cheney worked for the giant oil conglomerate Haliburton before becoming VP. Isn't that strange? Haliburton gave Cheney $34,000,000, as a farewell gift when he left Haliburton. Isn't that strange? Haliburton is in the pipeline construction business. Isn't that strange? There is $6 Trillion dollars worth of oil in the Caspian Sea area. Isn't that strange? The US government quietly announces Jan 31, 2002 we will support the construction of the Trans-Afghanistan pipeline. Isn't that strange? President Musharref (Pakistan), and Karrzai, (Afghanistan...ex-Unocal) announce agreement to build the proposed gas pipeline from Central Asia to Pakistan via Afghanistan. Isn't that strange? Fred here again. These five articles might cause some to feel anger and even hatred towards our own government. That is not at all my intention in sending them to you. My intention is only to try to help those who are interested to understand the why of Sept. 11th. I dont think our feelings of anger and hatred help to do anything except spread more anger and hatred in the world. If we find ourselves feeling hatred and/or anger towards Bush and those pushing for war, we can choose to remember that it is anger and hatred which caused the recent tragic events, and anger and hatred which are behind American support of military retaliation. While consciously working to make our government and leaders more responsible and just, we can try our best to send out love and support to the divine spark, the divine essence that lies in all of our leaders. I would encourage us not to deny or repress any feelings. We can acknowledge and accept any feelings of anger or hatred we might have, yet we can also do our best to move beyond those feelings to find the deeper love we have for all humanity and for the divine essence that lies in all. If we all do our best to send divine love to Bush and to all our politicians and leaders, I know it makes a real difference.

In the meantime, the Minister of Environment of\nEngland (who just resigned in June) made headlines yesterday by presenting\nvery specific evidence that some top officials in the US government knew\nabout the 9-11 attacks beforehand and did nothing to stop them.

Ryan was terminated Tuesday from his job at Environmental Health Laboratories Inc., a subsidiary of Underwriters Laboratories Inc., the consumer-product safety testing giant. On Nov. 11, Ryan wrote a letter to the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- the agency probing the collapse -- challenging the common theory that burning jet fuel weakened the steel supports holding up the 110-story skyscrapers. Underwriters Laboratories Inc., according to Ryan, \"was the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the WTC buildings.\" Ryan wrote that last year, while \"requesting information,\" UL's chief executive officer and fire protection business manager disagreed about key issues surrounding the collapse, \"except for one thing -- that the samples we certified met all requirements.\" UL vehemently denied", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911kevinrryanfired.txt:0:cc6d7addd962", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8461, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911kevinrryanfired.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911kevinrryanfired", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "-- challenging the common theory that burning jet fuel weakened the steel supports holding up the 110-story skyscrapers.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting a $16 million, two-year investigation of the collapse of the twin towers. The agency expects to issue a draft report in January, and UL has played a limited role in the investigation. **Ryan wrote that the institute's preliminary reports suggest the WTC's supports were probably exposed to fires no hotter than 500 degrees -- only half the 1,100-degree temperature needed to forge steel, Ryan said. That's also much cooler, he wrote, than the 3,000 degrees needed to melt bare steel with no fire-proofing.** **\"This story just does not add up,\" Ryan wrote in his e-mail to Frank Gayle, deputy chief of the institute's metallurgy division, who is playing a prominent role in the agency investigation. \"If steel from those buildings did soften or melt, I'm sure we can all agree that this was certainly not due to jet fuel fires of any kind, let alone the briefly burning fires in those towers.\"** He added, \"Alternatively, the contention that this steel did fail at temperatures around (500 degrees) suggests that the majority of deaths on 9/11 were due to a safety-related failure. That suggestion should be of great concern to my company.\" Ryan declined to comment about his letter Thursday when reached at his South Bend home. But his allegations drew a sharp rebuke from UL, which said Ryan wrote the letter \"without UL's knowledge or authorization.\" The company told The Tribune \"there is no evidence\" that any firm tested the materials used to build the towers. \"UL does not certify structural steel, such as the beams, columns and trusses used in World Trade Center,\" said Paul M. Baker, the company's spokesman. **Ryan was fired, Baker said, because he \"expressed his own opinions as though they were institutional opinions and beliefs of UL.\"** \"The contents of the argument itself are spurious at best, and frankly, they're just wrong,\" Baker said. Seeking to head off controversy just months before its report is released, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued its own statement Thursday. Some steel recovered from the WTC was exposed to fires of only 400 to 600 degrees, the institute said, but computer modeling has shown higher temperatures of 1,100 to 1,300 degrees or greater were \"likely\" experienced by steel in regions directly affected by the fires.

The institute believes impact from the jets dislodged fireproofing surrounding some of the steel, and the higher temperatures led to the buckling of the towers' core columns. Wrangling on the Web Ryan's statements have generated interest on many Web sites, including some advocating sharp scrutiny of the federal government's WTC probe. Ryan copied his e-mail to David Ray Griffin, author of \"The New Pearl Harbor,\" and to Catherine Austin Fitts, a board member of 911Truth.org -- a Web site organized by citizens who believe the government is covering up the true cause of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. One day later, Griffin requested and received permission to distribute Ryan's letter to other parties. **An official from 911Truth.org called Ryan to confirm his authorship. They said Ryan made it clear he is speaking for himself only, not on behalf of his laboratory or the company, but that others at UL were aware of his action.** The letter was published Nov. 11 on the Web site septembereleventh.org, site of the 9/11 Visibility Project. On Tuesday, organizers of the 911Truth.org Web site noted Ryan had been fired. In his letter, Ryan appeared confident in his statements about the WTC's fire protection levels. \"You may know that there are a number of current and former government employees that have risked a great deal to help us to know the truth,\" he told the institute's Gayle. \"Please do what you can to quickly eliminate the confusion regarding the ability of jet fuel fires to soften or melt structural steel.\" UL moved immediately to discredit Ryan. The company said Ryan \"was not involved in that work and was not associated in any way with UL's Fire Protection Division, which conducted testing at NIST's request.\" The company said it \"fully supports NIST's ongoing efforts to investigate the WTC tragedy. We regret any confusion that Mr. Ryan's letter has caused 9/11 survivors, victims' families and their friends.\" \"We prefer to base our conclusions, and NIST would say the same, on science rather than speculation,\" Baker said. \"We anxiously await the outcome of the NIST investigation.\" Organizers of 911Truth.org came to Ryan's defense Thursday, although they couldn't persuade him to speak publicly. **\"He just saw too many contradictions, and it set off his sense of what was the right thing to do,\" said David Kubiak, 911Truth.org's executive director. \"It's unfortunate for the country, and it's particularly tragic for him, but inspiring as hell.\"** **\"The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911kevinrryanfired.txt:2:5b9ef81a7943", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8463, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911kevinrryanfired.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911kevinrryanfired", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "and NIST would say the same, on science rather than speculation,\" Baker said. \"We anxiously await the outcome of the NIST investigation.\" Organizers of 911Truth.org came to Ryan's defense Thursday, although they couldn't persuade him to speak publicly. **\"He just saw too many contradictions, and it set off his sense of what was the right thing to do,\" said David Kubiak, 911Truth.org's executive director. \"It's unfortunate for the country, and it's particularly tragic for him, but inspiring as hell.\"** **\"The way things are working in the country right now,\" Kubiak added, \"it's only going to be citizens like this who take their professional knowledge and sense of personal integrity, and put it ahead of the strange status quo, that we will see truth and justice out of the system.\"** *Staff writer John Dobberstein: [jdobberstein@sbtinfo.com](mailto:jdobberstein@sbtinfo.com) (574) 235-6187* **See our archive of revealing news articles at ****[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)** ** ** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Why is the US government so keen to cover it up? **Michael Meacher Thursday July 22, 2004 [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/)** Omar Sheikh, a British-born Islamist militant, is waiting to be hanged in Pakistan for a murder he almost certainly didn't commit - of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002. Both the US government and Pearl's wife have since acknowledged that Sheikh was not responsible. Yet the Pakistani government is refusing to try other suspects newly implicated in Pearl's kidnap and murder for fear the evidence they produce in court might acquit Sheikh and reveal too much. Significantly, Sheikh is also the man who, on the instructions of General Mahmoud Ahmed, the then head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), wired $100,000 before the 9/11 attacks to Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker. It is extraordinary that neither Ahmed nor Sheikh have been charged and brought to trial on this count. Why not? Ahmed, the paymaster for the hijackers, was actually in Washington on 9/11, and had a series of pre-9/11 top-level meetings in the White House, the Pentagon, the national security council, and with George Tenet, then head of the CIA, and Marc Grossman, the under-secretary of state for political affairs. When Ahmed was exposed by the Wall Street Journal as having sent the money to the hijackers, he was forced to \"retire\" by President Pervez Musharraf. Why hasn't the US demanded that he be questioned and tried in court? Another person who must know a great deal about what led up to 9/11 is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, allegedly arrested in Rawalpindi on March 1 2003. A joint Senate-House intelligence select committee inquiry in July 2003 stated: \"KSM appears to be one of Bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants and was active in recruiting people to travel outside Afghanistan, including to the US, on behalf of Bin Laden.\" According to the report, the clear implication was that they would be engaged in planning terrorist-related activities. The report was sent from the CIA to the FBI, but neither agency", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911pakistanconnection.txt:0:1fccc67a3139", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8465, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911pakistanconnection.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911pakistanconnection", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Mohammed, allegedly arrested in Rawalpindi on March 1 2003. A joint Senate-House intelligence select committee inquiry in July 2003 stated: \"KSM appears to be one of Bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants and was active in recruiting people to travel outside Afghanistan, including to the US, on behalf of Bin Laden.\" According to the report, the clear implication was that they would be engaged in planning terrorist-related activities. The report was sent from the CIA to the FBI, but neither agency apparently recognised the significance of a Bin Laden lieutenant sending terrorists to the US and asking them to establish contacts with colleagues already there. Yet the New York Times has since noted that \"American officials said that KSM, once al-Qaida's top operational commander, personally executed Daniel Pearl ... but he was unlikely to be accused of the crime in an American criminal court because of the risk of divulging classified information\". Indeed, he may never be brought to trial. A fourth witness is Sibel Edmonds. She is a 33-year-old Turkish-American former FBI translator of intelligence, fluent in Farsi, the language spoken mainly in Iran and Afghanistan, who had top-secret security clearance. She tried to blow the whistle on the cover-up of intelligence that names some of the culprits who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks, but is now under two gagging orders that forbid her from testifying in court or mentioning the names of the people or the countries involved. She has been quoted as saying: \"My translations of the 9/11 intercepts included [terrorist] money laundering, detailed and date-specific information ... if they were to do real investigations, we would see several significant high-level criminal prosecutions in this country [the US] ... and believe me, they will do everything to cover this up\". Furthermore, the trial in the US of Zacharias Moussaoui (allegedly the 20th hijacker) is in danger of collapse apparently because of \"the CIA's reluctance to allow key lieutenants of Osama bin Laden to testify at the trial\". Two of the alleged conspirators have already been set free in Germany for the same reason. The FBI, illegally, continues to refuse the to release of their agent Robert Wright's 500-page manuscript Fatal Betrayals of the Intelligence Mission, and has even refused to turn the manuscript over to Senator Shelby, vice-chairman of the joint intelligence committee charged with investigating America's 9/11 intelligence failures. And the US government still refuses to declassify 28 secret pages of a recent report on 9/11. It has been rumoured that Pearl was especially interested in any role played by the US in training or backing the ISI. Daniel Ellsberg, the former US defence department whistleblower who has accompanied Edmonds in court, has stated: \"It seems to me quite plausible that Pakistan was quite involved in this ... To say Pakistan is, to me, to say CIA because ... it's hard to say that the ISI knew something", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911pakistanconnection.txt:1:45776f8360cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8466, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911pakistanconnection.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911pakistanconnection", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "secret pages of a recent report on 9/11.

To say Pakistan is, to me, to say CIA because ... it's hard to say that the ISI knew something that the CIA had no knowledge of.\" Ahmed's close relations with the CIA would seem to confirm this. For years the CIA used the ISI as a conduit to pump billions of dollars into militant Islamist groups in Afghanistan, both before and after the Soviet invasion of 1979. With CIA backing, the ISI has developed, since the early 1980s, into a parallel structure, a state within a state, with staff and informers estimated by some at 150,000. It wields enormous power over all aspects of government. The case of Ahmed confirms that parts of the ISI directly supported and financed al-Qaida, and it has long been established that the ISI has acted as go-between in intelligence operations on behalf of the CIA. Senator Bob Graham, chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has said: \"I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted, not just in financing ... by a sovereign foreign government.\" In that context, Horst Ehmke, former coordinator of the West German secret services, observed: \"Terrorists could not have carried out such an operation with four hijacked planes without the support of a secret service.\" That might give meaning to the reaction on 9/11 of Richard Clarke, the White House counter-terrorism chief, when he saw the passenger lists later on the day itself: \"I was stunned ... that there were al-Qaida operatives on board using names that the FBI knew were al-Qaida.\" It was just that, as Dale Watson, head of counter-terrorism at the FBI told him, the \"CIA forgot to tell us about them\". **·** Michael Meacher is Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton.

Anyone who investigates this matter will soon find that the United States Air Force and the FAA both have established procedures that have been in place for at least 25 years regarding planes that veer abnormally off course. Specifically, federal law MANDATES that the Air Force must dispatch a plane to investigate why a certain craft has strayed from its predestined route. These interceptors are only allowed to shoot an airliner from the sky under orders from the President, but that doesn't negate that they are still required to investigate the situation in a timely manner. Yet, on 9-11, NO ONE FOLLOWED ORDERS! Why? Who gave these orders? Plus, Washington, D.C. has the most restricted air space in the country, yet from 9:03 a.m., when the second tower was hit, to 9:47 a.m. when the Pentagon came under attack ... when the Air Force KNEW that a jet was headed toward the Capitol, no planes were dispatched to intercept it. Who gave the orders for these planes to 'stand down,' and, God forbid, were some even called back after they had taken off? To begin understanding how appalling this situation is, we first need to know that there are at least twelve or more National Guard and Air Force installations in close proximity to the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Plus, Andrews Air Force Base is only ten miles from the heart of Washington, D.C. Why wasn't something done to avert this catastrophe, and why isn't the mainstream media asking some very hard questions regarding this deliberately ordered \"crime\"? Yes, I said crime, and once you get a load of the following timeline, you'll concur with this strong terminology. Between 7:59 a.m. - 8:10 a.m., the airliners that would ultimately crash into the WTC and Pentagon were hijacked. By 8:15 a.m., air traffic controllers knew that these planes were in trouble. At this point, the Air Force should have dispatched, per standard operating procedures, fighters that would determine why these jets veered from their normal route. By 8:15 a.m.! At 8:45 a.m. - a half-hour later - American Airlines flight 11 struck the WTC's North Tower. (This flight took off at exactly 7:59 a.m., thus controllers knew it was in trouble for at least 35 minutes, if not more.) At 9:03 a.m., United Airlines flight 175 crashed into the South Tower. (It took off at exactly 8:10 a.m.) At 9:05 a.m. (supposedly), Andrew Card told President Bush of the unfolding", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911standdown.txt:0:e322ac5684ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8476, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911standdown.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911standdown", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "jets veered from their normal route.

(It took off at exactly 8:10 a.m.) At 9:05 a.m. (supposedly), Andrew Card told President Bush of the unfolding catastrophe. At the same time, American Airlines Flight 77 veered off course near Chicago and headed toward D.C. for an impending attack. At 9:06 a.m., the New York Daily News reported that on the morning of the attack, the NYPD dispatched a message declaring, \"This was a terrorist attack - notify the Pentagon.\" Still, NO Air Force jets had yet been scrambled! None! Why? At 9:35 a.m., American Airlines flight 77, which had been tracked by radar all the way from Chicago, circled the Pentagon, yet this military installation was not evacuated! Plus, the Air Force had still not sent out any jets! How completely incredible is this scenario? A few minutes later, with the utmost precision, American Airlines flight 77 drops 7,000 feet in 2 minutes. Do you realize what a truly difficult maneuver this is? It is flying so low at this point that the plane is taking out utility poles and clipping trees en route to its target. The jumbo jet finally zeroes in EXACTLY on the Pentagon while traveling at 460 knots (approx 529 mph). Are we really to believe that this precision \"Top Gun\" style flying was executed by a group of desert-trained Afghani's who had only flown Cessna and Piper prop-planes at a flight school in Florida for six months, many of them reportedly unable to even take off or land them adequately? Come on! This is the most inept cock-n-bull story since the 'surprise attack' on Pearl Harbor. Finally, at 9:40 a.m., a full hour and 31 minutes after the FAA knew that the first airliner had been hijacked ... guess what happened. The Air Force dispatched their jets! The Pentagon was aware of these hijackings since at least 8:45 a.m. when the first tower was struck (and more likely before then), yet it took them 55 minutes to take action. 55 minutes! By 8:15 a.m., when the FAA learned of the hijackings, federal law required that the military dispatch planes to either divert the plane's course, or determine the need to shoot them down. This is normal procedure! But the Pentagon waited until 9:40 a.m. after all the damage was already done. Who commanded the Air Force to stand down, and why is the media still feeding us the \"incompetence\" line? The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk could have had a plane up in the air in that much time!

Who commanded the Air Force to stand down, and why is the media still feeding us the \"incompetence\" line? The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk could have had a plane up in the air in that much time! Barry Zwicker, a Canadian media analyst, wrote on January 21, 2002: \"That morning no interceptors responded in a timely fashion to the highest alert situation. That includes the Andrews squadron which are 12 miles from the White House. Whatever the explanation for the huge failure, there have been no reports, to my knowledge, of reprimands. This further weakens the incompetence theory! Incompetence usually earns reprimands. This causes me to ask whether there were 'stand down' orders.\" To add more weight to the peculiarity of this situation, consider the flight capacity of the four hijacked airliners. These routes were extremely popular ones, most of them filled to 100% capacity during weekdays. In fact, oftentimes, fliers were asked if they wanted to give up their seats to another traveler. Yet on 9-11, the four flights in question were uncharacteristically empty. American Airlines 11 - filled to only 39% of capacity American Airlines 77 - filled to only 27% of capacity United Airlines 175 - filled to only 26% of capacity United Airlines 93 - filled to only 16% of capacity In an industry that takes extremely close notice of such matters, why didn't anyone see the red flags that were being waved? Did someone tell them to neglect these glaring inconsistencies to lessen the collateral damage (or the insurance payouts)? Since I mentioned United Airlines flight 93, consider this odd bit of information. The Reuters news agency reported on 9-13-2001 in an article entitled, \"Troubling Questions in Troubling Times\": \"Pennsylvania State Police officials said on Thursday debris from the plan had been found up to EIGHT MILES AWAY from the crash site.\" Do you realize how immense an eight-mile stretch of land is? Do you also realize that when a plane drops from the sky, the impact does not cause the wreckage to scatter for eight miles? Think about it. Eight miles is the length of 140 football fields laid end-to-end! Obviously, something else happened to bring Flight 93 out of the sky. Strong evidence points to the Air Force shooting it down, then the plane disintegrated during its eight-mile descent into a rural Pennsylvania field. Yet the powers-that-be lied once again to the American people. Now do you know why President Bush personally asked Tom Daschle to limit their Congressional inquiry? Another aspect of this case that makes me scratch my head is this: why won't the FAA release the entire records of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911standdown.txt:2:f014f174f8f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8478, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911standdown.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911standdown", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "happened to bring Flight 93 out of the sky.

Yet the powers-that-be lied once again to the American people. Now do you know why President Bush personally asked Tom Daschle to limit their Congressional inquiry? Another aspect of this case that makes me scratch my head is this: why won't the FAA release the entire records of the pilot conversations with their air-traffic controllers? Another pertinent question revolves around the pilot's curious reactions during these hijackings. Once they got the first inkling that they were being overtaken, why didn't they simply perform a \"rollover\" to incapacitate or disable the hijackers? The \"barrel roll\" is an easily-performed procedure for veteran pilots, especially when one considers the backgrounds of the four men who manned these flights. As Colonel Donn de Grand Pre reports: John Ogonowski - Vietnam Air Force fighter pilot Leroy Homer - Former Air Force pilot Victor Saracini - Former fighter pilot Chic Burlingame - Naval Academy graduate who flew F-4's in Vietnam All of these pilots were described as being strong, agile, healthy, in excellent physical condition, and certainly capable of performing a simple rollover. Now I'm not blaming these men by any means ... it just seems like, if given the opportunity, these pilots would have disoriented the \"hijackers\" enough to gain control of the situation and avert disaster. Rather, we're being led to believe that these three jumbo jets were flown into buildings by Middle Eastern hijackers brandishing nothing more than box cutters, and all of them had only six months flying experience. I don't know about you, but if everything were on the up-and-up, I'd put my faith in these pilots being able to nullify the hijackers any day of the week. But again, we're not being given the entire story because something doesn't add up. I could continue with dozens of other inconsistencies, but instead I'll close on this note. 1) Who in the mainstream media is asking these, and other, pertinent questions? No one! 2) Who in the Pentagon is answering these questions? No one! 3) Finally, who in the Pentagon has been made accountable for the Air Force stand-down? Again, no one! Do you think it's time that we FORCE our government and the media to start addressing these issues? I do. **Note: **To verify many of these facts go to [www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up10pg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts).

Do you remember the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative to build a massive missile defense system that raised so much controversy during the Reagan and first Bush years? [130 billion of our tax dollars](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-missiles20dec20,0,1532739.story) were poured into developing that system. It was designed to detect and intercept missiles fired from an *unknown destination* traveling at well *over 10 times the speed* of a commercial airliner, and to shoot them down in 15 minutes or less, before they reached their US targets. According the [Congressional Budget Office](http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5679&type=0&sequence=2) (CBO) website, \"a defensive system may need to hit a warhead smaller than an oil drum that is traveling above the atmosphere at speeds greater than 13,000 miles per hour.\" The [CBO report](http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5679&type=0) states that missile defense and intercept systems must take down an ICBM in a matter of minutes or it is all over. You may remember that before 9/11, there were a number of tests of the \"Star Wars\" missile defense systems. Some tests failed, while others succeeded. But there is an important question here. **If these sophisticated military systems were designed to detect missiles fired from unknown locations at over 13,000 mph and shoot them down in mere minutes, why on 9/11 could they not detect any one of the four large airliners traveling at a mere 600 mph, especially when two of them were known to be lost for over 40 minutes before they crashed?** This question applies especially to Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. The first plane hijacking on 9/11 was reported at about 8:20 AM (see [*NY Times*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010915nytimes11)), well over an hour before Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon at 9:38. According to the *Times* article, Flight 77 was reported lost at 8:56 A.M., 42 minutes before it crashed. Even if the FAA radar systems completely failed and FAA officials failed to alert the military, all military leaders certainly knew within minutes that the World Trade Center had been hit at 8:46. By 9:03, when the second tower was hit, they certainly knew there were big problems. **How is it possible that the Pentagon's highly touted missile detections systems could not locate Flight 77 in the 42 minutes it was known to be lost before it crashed into the heart of the defense system of the U.S.?** The missile detection systems did not depend on FAA radar and were programmed to pick up any unaccounted for objects and raise alarms immediately, as mentioned on the CBO website. Here's another related question. Why was the Pentagon's billion-dollar missile defense system such a hot topic in the media before 9/11, yet we've heard almost nothing about it since?

Could it be that there are elements in the government and military who don't want people to think about questions like those asked here? And an even bigger question is why isn't our media asking these questions and more? **Why is it that the 9/11 Commission budget was far less than the budget allotted to the Challenger space shuttle disaster or even the Monica Lewinsky affair?** The 9/11 commission was originally [allotted only $3 million](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q5). Eventually, after much begging and haggling, the commission was given $15 million. Yet a [CNN article](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/01/starr.costs/) lists the cost of the Lewinsky investigation at $30 million. A [*Los Angeles Times*article](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/15/nation/na-probe15) states the cost of the Columbia space shuttle disaster investigation was $175 million. How could 9/11 - the greatest disaster in American history - be given such a small budget for investigation? Why didn't the Pentagon want to aggressively investigate the greatest failure ever in U.S. defenses? And why did both the president (see [CNN article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-opposes-9-11-query-panel/)) and vice-president (see [*Newsweek*article](http://www.newsweek.com/battle-back-home-147649)) initially oppose any investigation at all?

In connection with this news, we have assembled 100 notable Americans and 40 family members of those who died to sign this 9/11 Statement, which calls for immediate public attention to unanswered questions that suggest that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war. **We want truthful answers to questions such as: ** Why were standard operating procedures for dealing with hijacked airliners not followed that day? Why were the extensive missile batteries and air defenses reportedly deployed around the Pentagon not activated during the attack? Why did the Secret Service allow Bush to complete his elementary school visit, apparently unconcerned about his safety or that of the schoolchildren? Why hasn't a single person been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for the gross incompetence we witnessed that day?

Why hasn't a single person been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for the gross incompetence we witnessed that day? Why haven't authorities in the U.S. and abroad published the results of multiple investigations into trading that strongly suggested foreknowledge of specific details of the 9/11 attacks, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of traceable gains? Why has Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, been publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge? How could Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, have flown back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military? How were the FBI and CIA able to release the names and photos of the alleged hijackers within hours, as well as to visit houses, restaurants, and flight schools they were known to frequent? What happened to the over 20 documented warnings given our government by 14 foreign intelligence agencies or heads of state? Why did the Bush administration cover up the fact that the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency was in Washington the week of 9/11 and reportedly had $100,000 wired to Mohamed Atta, considered the ringleader of the hijackers? Why did the 911 Commission fail to address most of the questions posed by the families of the victims, in addition to almost all of the questions posed here? Why was Philip Zelikow chosen to be the Executive Director of the ostensibly independent 911 Commission although he had co-authored a book with Condoleezza Rice? Those who are demanding deeper inquiry now number in the hundreds of thousands, including a former member of the first Bush administration, a retired Air Force colonel, a European parliamentarian, families of the victims, highly respected authors, investigative journalists, peace and justice leaders, former Pentagon staff, and the National Green Party. **As Americans of conscience, we ask for four things: ** An immediate investigation by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer Immediate investigation in Congressional Hearings.

The video, \"9/11: Pentagon Strike,\" suggests that it was not American Airlines Flight 77 that slammed into the Pentagon, but a missile or a small plane. With rock music as a backdrop, the video offers flashes of photographs taken shortly after impact, interspersed with witness accounts. The pictures seem incompatible with damage caused by a jumbo jet, and no one mentions seeing one. Red arrows point to unbroken windows in the burning building. Firefighters stand outside a perfectly round hole in a Pentagon wall where the Boeing 757 punched through; it is less than 20 feet in diameter. Propelled by word of mouth, Internet search engines and e-mail, the video has been downloaded by millions of people around the world. American history is rife with conspiracy theories. Extremists have fed rumors of secret plots by Masons, bankers, Catholics and Communists. But now urban legends have become cyberlegends, and suspicions speed their way globally not over months and weeks but within days and hours on the Web. \"The dissemination is almost immediate,\" said Doug Thomas, a University of Southern California communications professor who teaches classes on technology and subgroups. \"It's not just one Web site saying, 'Hey, look at this.' It's 10,000 people sending e-mails to 10 friends, and then they send it on.\" The Pentagon video could be a case study. Williams created a Web site for the video, [www.pentagonstrike.co.uk](http://www.pentagonstrike.co.uk/). Then he e-mailed a copy to Laura Knight-Jadczyk, an American author living in France whose books include one on alien abduction.

Williams created a Web site for the video, [www.pentagonstrike.co.uk](http://www.pentagonstrike.co.uk/). Then he e-mailed a copy to Laura Knight-Jadczyk, an American author living in France whose books include one on alien abduction. Williams, 31, a systems analyst, belongs to an online group hosted by Knight-Jadczyk that blends discussions of science, politics and the paranormal. On Aug. 23, Knight-Jadczyk posted a link to the video on the group's Web site, [www.Cassiopaea.org](http://www.cassiopaea.org/). Within 36 hours, Williams's site collapsed under the crush of tens of thousands of visitors. But there were others to fill the void. In Texas, a former casino worker who downloaded the video began drawing almost 700,000 visitors a day to his libertarian site. In Louisiana, a young Navy specialist put the video on his personal Web page, usually visited by a few friends and relatives; suddenly, the site was inundated by more than 20,000 hits. In Alberta, traffic to a cabdriver's site shot up more than sixfold after he supplied a link to the video. Across thousands of sites, demand for the video was so great that some webmasters solicited donations to pay for the extra bandwidth. \"Pentagon Strike\" is just the latest and flashiest example of a growing number of Web sites, books and videos contending that something other than a commercial airliner hit the Pentagon. Most make their case through the selective use of photographs and eyewitness accounts reported during the confusion of the first hours after the attack. They say they don't know what really happened to American Airlines Flight 77 and don't offer other explanations. The doubters say they are just asking questions that have not been answered satisfactorily. The ready and growing audience for conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been particularly galling to those who worked on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the bipartisan panel known as the 9/11 commission. \"We discussed the theories,\" said Philip D. Zelikow, the commission's executive director. \"When we wrote the report, we were also careful not to answer all the theories. It's like playing Whack-A-Mole. You're never going to whack them all. They satisfy a deep need in the people who create them. What we tried to do instead was to affirmatively tell what was true and tell it adding a lot of critical details that we knew would help dispel concerns.\" Conspiracy theories are common after traumatic events. Michael Barkun, a political scientist at Syracuse University who has written books on the culture of conspiracies, said contradictory and inconclusive eyewitness accounts often leave room for different interpretations of events. \"Conspiracy theories are one way to make sense of what happened and regain a sense of control,\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911storybreaks.txt:1:a2d2dc3fc37b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8491, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911storybreaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911storybreaks", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "do instead was to affirmatively tell what was true and tell it adding a lot of critical details that we knew would help dispel concerns.\" Conspiracy theories are common after traumatic events. Michael Barkun, a political scientist at Syracuse University who has written books on the culture of conspiracies, said contradictory and inconclusive eyewitness accounts often leave room for different interpretations of events. \"Conspiracy theories are one way to make sense of what happened and regain a sense of control,\" Barkun said. \"Of course, they're usually wrong, but they're psychologically reassuring. Because what they say is that everything is connected, nothing happens by accident, and that there is some kind of order in the world, even if it's produced by evil forces. I think psychologically, it's in a way consoling to a lot of people.\" The belief that the government is lying about the Sept. 11 attacks is coming from both the right and the left. Experts say more than suspicion of the Bush administration is at work. \"It seems that since the end of the Cold War, the enemy is the United States government, the enemy is within,\" said Rick Ross, whose Ross Institute of New Jersey monitors cults and other controversial groups, many of which see manipulative forces working behind the scenes. \"Instead of projecting conspiracy theories out, it's become internalized.\" Zelikow, for example, lacks credibility with many who question the work of the 9/11 commission because he wrote a book with national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. He believes that it is futile to discuss evidence with people convinced of a conspiracy. \"The hardcore conspiracy theorists are totally committed,\" Zelikow said. \"They'd have to repudiate much of their life identity in order not to accept some of that stuff. That's not our worry. Our worry is when things become infectious, as happened with the [John F. Kennedy] assassination. Then this stuff can be deeply corrosive to public understanding. You can get where the bacteria can sicken the larger body.\" David Ray Griffin considers himself an unlikely recruit to what is called the \"9/11 Truth Movement.\" The retired theologian, who taught religion for three decades at Claremont School of Theology, initially dismissed the notion that it was not an airliner that hit the Pentagon. But after visiting several Internet sites raising questions about the attack, he ended up writing a book. \"The New Pearl Harbor,\" published in the spring, argues that a Boeing 757 would have caused far more damage and left more wreckage strewn around the Pentagon. \"There are reasons why people doubt the official story,\" he said. \"There are photographs taken, and there is no Boeing in sight.\" Suspicions formed as the Pentagon still smoldered. For 2 1/2 years, the attack on the Pentagon has been discussed and researched by members of Knight-Jadczyk's online group, the Quantum Future School. The group's talks formed the basis for articles", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911storybreaks.txt:2:3afb955b7a5b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8492, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911storybreaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911storybreaks", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "argues that a Boeing 757 would have caused far more damage and left more wreckage strewn around the Pentagon. \"There are reasons why people doubt the official story,\" he said. \"There are photographs taken, and there is no Boeing in sight.\" Suspicions formed as the Pentagon still smoldered. For 2 1/2 years, the attack on the Pentagon has been discussed and researched by members of Knight-Jadczyk's online group, the Quantum Future School. The group's talks formed the basis for articles in which Knight-Jadczyk argues that after the attack on the World Trade Center, eyewitnesses at the Pentagon were predisposed to see a large airliner. She believes that the Pentagon was attacked by a smaller plane and that members of the Bush administration were somehow complicit because it was beneficial for war-profiteers and Israel. Interviewed by telephone from what she said is a 17-bedroom castle outside Toulouse, where she lives with her Polish physicist husband and five children, Knight-Jadczyk acknowledged that her group is considered \"fringe.\" Knight-Jadczyk, 52, a Florida native, has been a psychic and a channeler. She is now involved in experiments in what she calls \"superluminal communication,\" which she described as involving \"time loops\" that would enable people to communicate with their former selves. Knight-Jadczyk said she never imagined anyone outside her group would ever view \"Pentagon Strike.\" \"The fact everybody's been sending it to his brother and his cousin, almost frenetically, reflects the fact that there is a deep unease,\" she said. \"They don't come out and say it. They don't want to be accused of being with terrorists, anti-American or anti-patriotic.

UFOs? The truth about what *really* happened on 9/11? The media cowers** [By Mark Morford, SF Gate Columnist](mailto:mmorford@sfgate.com)** **Wednesday, October 27, 2004 **** I get this a lot: Hey Mark, you're a rather weird, unconventional columnist, why don't you quit toeing the typical blasé journalism line and renounce the corporate-controlled news feeds and standard pop-culture drivel and instead write about the *real* truths, the *real* and sinister power structures at work in America and the world? Like for example how both Kerry and Bush are members of mega-yuppie Yale secret society/boys' club [Skull & Bones](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/02/60minutes/main576332.shtml), and therefore suckle at the same tit of nefarious primeval Illuminati power and draw their ideas from same trough of covert draconian ideology, the one that is right now running the world via an insanely intricate network of corporate fronts and Swiss bank accounts and invisible spaceships and ancient cabals featuring really elaborate handshakes that would make \"The Da Vinci Code\" seem like a day at the sandbox? Hmm? And why, furthermore, don't you talk about the real truths of 9/11? Like how BushCo not only allowed the tragedy to occur to further his administration's snarling agenda but also how he actually made it happen, [signed the order himself](http://rense.com/general57/aale.htm), with the full and complicit cooperation of the FBI and the CIA and the Saudis and maybe even Enron and the Wal-Mart heirs and probably the Olsen twins. And by the way did you know the planes that crashed into the WTC were fully radio controlled? And Dick Cheney was commanding the entire thing from the ground and they had been [rehearsing the attack for months](http://www.911review.org/) and it was all part of a master plan decades in the making and by the way what about the Pentagon? Haven't you seen [that amazing video on that Web site](http://freedomunderground.org/memoryhole/pentagon121.swf)? Those incredible and damning photos? Noticed the weird cover-up?

Repressed? I mean, who cares about the price of raw sweet crude or rampant overfishing when there's astounding crop-circle phenomena and suspicious Air Force inactivity and grainy aerial photos from Area 51 to stare at with a magnifying glass and huge doses of mistrust? Does this make you laugh? Scoff? It is, after all, incredibly easy to dismiss conspiracy theories as ranty silly unproven wishful thinking wrought by desperately lonely fatalists and nutballs and geeks, fringe kooks ever reaching for some eternally just-out-of-reach meta-explanation, some sort of proof of massive cover-up and of the existence of a very real Matrix, and it's all best explained by the mad brilliance of the books of [David Icke](http://davidicke.com/). But you know what? It's not that easy. And it ain't so silly. These people, they have a point. They are indeed onto something quite large and ominous and it very much has to do with the media toeing the line of \"safe\" information and not really asking truly difficult or radically off-track questions of our leaders or of the strangeness happening in the world. Reptilian super-races from the fifth dimension walking among us and secretly mind controlling your child via MSG and fluoridated water? OK, maybe not. But look just a little deeper. After all, there is indeed ample evidence that the U.S. government, long before 9/11, had already discussed the quite plausible possibilities and strategic benefits of unleashing a [\"Pearl Harbor\"-type event](http://rense.com/general57/aale.htm) on America for the purposes of creating havoc and fear and furthering certain agendas. This much is a given. And it's just the tip of the iceberg. Look. There are plenty of strangely unanswered questions about 9/11, about the stunning inaction of NORAD and Bush's stupefying nonreaction upon hearing of the attack, not to mention his administration's incredible attempts to halt any independent 9/11 investigations, and have you ever read a fully satisfying account of how this whole atrocity could have happened, one that answered all your questions and quelled your lingering doubts and squashed, once and for all, any hints of dread you had about our government's potential role in the tragedy?

Neither have I. Neither has anyone. Of course, no one in any major media will touch this stuff. It is professional suicide to dare suggest an alternate truth to the one supplied by the Pentagon and regurgitated by the media, despite the fact that most every journalist, trained as they are to be suspicious and wary and fully cognizant of the fact that there is always more to a given apocalypse than meets the eye, every journalist knows that buried just beneath the slippery surface of any good conspiracy theory is a gem or three of real truth, a question that begs to be solved or at least researched and, yet, most likely never will, because it has been cast into the madhouse of \"outrageous\" impossibility and is therefore rendered impotent and hopeless. Look at it this way. Much of the world believes in UFOs. Or ghosts. Or telekinesis. Or past lives. Or alternate realities. Or the paranormal. Or all of the above. Most of us fully intuit that we are not the center of the universe and that it's rather narcissistic and outrageously arrogant of us to think we are. Whether or not this means shiny blinking flying saucers and androgynous Gumby-like aliens with almond-shaped eyes is beside the point; most sentient bipedal creatures know there is [more to all of this](http://whatthebleep.com/) than just puny and egotistical little us. And yet, go ahead and try to get any serious public figure or mainstream pundit to openly admit this belief, this fact, in public. Try to find more than a glossy and supercilious feature in, say, Time magazine (i.e., \"UFOs: Gosh, are they really here?\") Won't happen, so surrounded are such topics in hokum and wide-eyed ranting and fringe intellectual cheese. The world of conspiracy theories, it is like a zoo. It is like a black hole. It is the place we as a culture toss ideas that don't fit quite right, that unsettle and disturb and cause us to shudder and shake off the queasy feeling. And it is the place the Powers That Be will toss any sinister and dark questions about their behavior, safe in the knowledge that anyone who goes to look for the answer will have to dive into that gnarled world and will look foolish and silly and will be probably be laughed off the stage.

Sometimes it's all you -- or I -- can do to hint at the existence of these radical notions and illuminate the frightening possibilities and scream into the Void, hoping to agitate and inform and inspire while still covering your professional butt. A copout? Maybe. But then again, if there's an alternative, I have yet to find it. And the truth is, we don't really *want* such unstable questions answered. We simply cannot tolerate to have our world, our leaders, our foundations so questioned. We prefer stasis to growth, security to true knowledge, blind faith to chaotic sticky self-defined wonder. After all, once you allow the real possibility of UFOs or psychic healing or crop-circle phenomena or the notion that we could very well have a hugely malicious, criminal U.S. government capable of pulling a 9/11 on its own citizens, well, the happy capitalistic all-American Christian world begins to implode. Foundations crumble. Trust in our institutions vanishes. Gods fall and doctrines crumble and televangelists spontaneously combust and everyone starts reimagining the social order in ways that absolutely terrify those who now hold the reins.

These reports could lead to the collapse of a corrupt power structure that has a stranglehold on the very institutions that are obligated to control it. On April 30th, Sibel Edmonds was my guest for 50 minutes on WGDR radio. What follows is an edited transcript of the interview. Sibel Edmonds is a former FBI translator. She blew the whistle on the cover-up of intelligence that names some of the culprits who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks. These culprits are protected by the Justice Department, the State Department, the FBI, the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee. They are foreign nationals and Americans. Ms. Edmonds is under two gag orders that forbid her to testify in court or mention the names of the people or the countries involved. THE INTERVIEW ** ** **JH:** Ms. Edmonds, what I'll do is invite you to tell us whatever you would like--your stint with the FBI--and what the brouhaha with Ashcroft and company is all about. **SE:** I started working for the Bureau immediately after 9/11 and I was performing translations for several languages: Farsi, Turkish, and Azerbaijani. And I do have top-secret clearance. And after I started working for the Bureau, most of my translation duties included translations of documents and investigations that actually started way before 9/11. During my work there I came across some very significant issues that I started reporting in December of 2001 to the mid-level management within the FBI. They said to basically leave it alone, because if they were to get into those issues it would end up being a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:0:2908fd4d44ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8519, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Azerbaijani. And I do have top-secret clearance. And after I started working for the Bureau, most of my translation duties included translations of documents and investigations that actually started way before 9/11. During my work there I came across some very significant issues that I started reporting in December of 2001 to the mid-level management within the FBI. They said to basically leave it alone, because if they were to get into those issues it would end up being a can of worms. And after I didn't see any response from this mid-level bureaucratic management I took it to higher levels all the way up to [assistant director] Dale Watson and Director Mueller. And, again, I was asked not to take this any further and just let it be. And if I didn't do that they would retaliate against me. At that point, which would be around February 2002, they came and they confiscated my computer, because, they said, they were suspecting that I was communicating with certain Senate members and taking this issue outside the Bureau. And, at that point, I was not. They did not find anything in my computer after they confiscated it. And they asked me to take a polygraph as to the allegations and reports I'd made. I volunteered and I took the polygraph and passed it without a glitch. They have already confirmed this publicly. In March 2002 I took this issue to the Senate Judiciary Committee and also I filed it with the Department of Justice Inspector General's office. And as per the Senate Judiciary Committee's request the IG started an expedited investigation on these serious issues; and they promised the Senate Judiciary Committee that their report for these investigations would be out by fall 2002 latest. And here we are in April 2004 and this report is not being made public, and they are citing \"state privilege\" and \"national security\" for not making this report public. Three weeks after I went to the Senate Judiciary Committee the Bureau terminated my contract, and they cited \"government's convenience.\" I started working with the Senate Judiciary Committee that was investigating this case, and I appeared before the Inspector General's office for their investigation several times, and I also requested documents regarding these reports under the Freedom of Information Act; and they blocked this by citing again the \"state secret privilege\" and \"national security\" refusing to make these documents public. On October 18th 2002 Attorney General Ashcroft came out personally, in public, asserted this rare \"state secret privilege\" on everything that had to do with my case. And they cited \"diplomatic relations\" and certain \"foreign relations\" that would be \"at stake\" if I were to take this issue and make it public. And, since then, this has been acting as a gag on my case. I testified before the [9/11] commission on February 11th 2004.

And, since then, this has been acting as a gag on my case. I testified before the [9/11] commission on February 11th 2004. I have been waiting for this report that they [the Attorney General's office] have been blocking for a year and a half from becoming public. The information I requested under the Freedom of Information Act has been blocked for two years. And I have been campaigning for the past three months trying to get the Senate Judiciary Committee that has the oversight authority and responsibility to start its own public hearings. However, this request is again being blocked. Now they [AG] are citing this upcoming election as reason. And here I am. **JH: And it is the Attorney General who is blocking your testimony.** **SE:** Senator Leahy, on April 8, 2004, sent a very strong letter to Attorney General Ashcroft, citing my case stating that he, Senator Leahy, has been asking questions, and has a lot of issues that have not been addressed, and asking AG Ashcroft to come and provide answers. And AG Ashcroft for the past two years has refused. So he [Leahy] is calling for a public hearing. However, Senator Hatch, who is the Republican Chairman of the Senate, has been a road block. And Senator Grassley [a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee] went on the record with New York Observer's Gail Sheehy and said that Senator Hatch is blocking this investigation from taking place and for this public hearing to be held by the Senate Judiciary Committee. **JH: **Do you think that Leahy and Grassley are going to try to plow ahead with this, or do you think that there is a back door deal with Hatch? **SE:** Well....as far as I see, Senator Leahy has been trying, and it's a strong letter that he issued a few weeks ago. [Ms. Edmonds refers here to the GPO's PDF (Senate--April 8, 2004; pages s4012-4014) regarding Ashcroft's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2003. Senator Leahy describes the inaction of Attorney General Ashcroft since their first meeting on September 19th 2001 as a \"flagrant avoidance of accountability.\"] However, I'm very disappointed with Senator Grassley's office and his staff members. They initially were very supportive. But what I am getting from their office every time I call is, \"Well this issue is under the Inspector General,\" and that their hands are tied. And then I press further and ask, \"Well, what do you mean, 'our hands are tied'? Who's tying your hands? Untie it. Let's get it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:2:75999a84dc3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8521, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "meeting on September 19th 2001 as a \"flagrant avoidance of accountability.\"] However, I'm very disappointed with Senator Grassley's office and his staff members.

And then I press further and ask, \"Well, what do you mean, 'our hands are tied'? Who's tying your hands? Untie it. Let's get it untied.\" They don't have any response. They say, \"Well, this issue is very complex, and as you know, it is being investigated.\" And I'm not seeing any issue being investigated. What I'm seeing is that this issue is being covered up, and relentlessly being covered up, in consideration of \"state privilege,\" which people are calling \"the neutron bomb of all privilege.\" **JH:** I have a question having to do with \"mid-level\" management at the FBI. Why do you think that mid-level FBI management would care enough to stop you from doing your job? **SE:** This was mainly for the reason of accountability. As you know, and as the chairman for the 9/11 Commission [Thomas Kean] answered during Tim Russert's show: to this day, not a single person has been held accountable. And certain issues, yes, they were due to a certain level of incompetence. But there were certain other issues--you know they keep talking about this \"wall,\" and not having communication. I beg to differ on that, because there are certain instances where the Bureau is being asked by the State Department not to pursue certain investigations or certain people or certain targets of an investigation--simply citing \"diplomatic relations.\" And what happens is, instead of targeting those people who are directly related to these illegal terrorist activities, they just let them walk free. **JH:** And they interrogate people who are trying to make voting safe. **SE:** And that is hypocritical. I see people detained for simple INS violations. On the other hand I have seen several, several top targets for these investigations of these terrorist activities that were allowed to leave the country--I'm not talking about weeks, I'm talking about months after 9/11. **JH:** And there were four major FBI investigations, not counting yours, that were squelched in Phoenix, Minneapolis, Chicago and New York. **SE:** Correct. **JH:** So, obviously, we have mid-level FBI people who have been told something. It was the mid-level FBI people who knew enough to squelch many of these investigations before they went further. So how did they know to do that? Can all of them have been incompetent? **SE:** No. Absolutely not. **JH:** So they got the word down from Mueller, probably. **SE:** I cannot confirm that for sure, but I can tell you that there is so much involvement, that if they did let this information out, and if they were to hold real", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:3:c1059e6b68a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8522, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "was the mid-level FBI people who knew enough to squelch many of these investigations before they went further.

If they were to do real investigations we would see several significant high level criminal prosecutions in this country. And that is something that they are not going to let out. And, believe me; they will do everything to cover this up. And I am appalled. I am really surprised. I'm taken back by seeing the mass media's reaction to this. They are the window to our government's operation and what are they doing? **JH:** I have another question: when the gag order was written, it had to do with \"diplomatic relations.\" Right? **SE:** That is what Attorney General Ashcroft cited. **JH:** Are you allowed to say that it's the Saudis? **SE:** I cannot name any country. And I would emphasize that it's plural. I understand the Saudis have been named because fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. However, the names of people from other countries, and semi-legit organizations from other countries, to this day, have not been made public. **JH:** And the information that you have been gagged on has to do with that specifically. **SE:** Correct. And specifically with that and their ties to people here in this country today. **JH:** I understand why you can't say anything about this, but there are several books out about the Bush ties to the Saudis and the bin Ladens in particular. And in David Griffin's book, *The New Pearl Harbor,* there is a very good synopsis of the ISI, which is the Pakistani intelligence service. He shows the direct connections between the CIA, the ISI, and Mohamed Atta. He makes a very convincing case that the Pakistani ISI had been helping to plan 9/11 for a long time. I don't imagine that you are allowed to say much about that. **SE:** You are correct. But I can tell you that the issue, on one side, boils down to money--a lot of money. And it boils down to people and their connections with this money, and that's the portion that, even with this book, has not been mentioned to this day. Because then it starts touching some people in high places. **JH:** Can you explain more about what money you are talking about? **SE:** The most significant information that we were receiving", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:4:75d4a9262bd8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8523, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "You are correct.

And it boils down to people and their connections with this money, and that's the portion that, even with this book, has not been mentioned to this day. Because then it starts touching some people in high places. **JH:** Can you explain more about what money you are talking about? **SE:** The most significant information that we were receiving did not come from counter-terrorism investigations, and I want to emphasize this. It came from counter-intelligence, and certain criminal investigations, and issues that have to do with money laundering operations. You get to a point where it gets very complex, where you have money laundering activities, drug related activities, and terrorist support activities converging at certain points and becoming one. In certain points - and they [the intelligence community] are separating those portions from just the terrorist activities. And, as I said, they are citing \"foreign relations\" which is not the case, because we are not talking about only governmental levels. And I keep underlining semi-legit organizations and following the money. When you do that the picture gets grim. It gets really ugly. ....**JH:** Let me read you a short quote from Dr. Griffin's book and ask you to comment on it. \"...The transfer of money to Atta [$325,000], in conjunction with the presence of the ISI chief in Washington during the week, [is] the missing link behind 9/11....The evidence confirms that al-Qaeda is supported by Pakistan's ISI (and it is amply documented that) the ISI owes its existence to the CIA.\" **SE:** I cannot comment on that. But I can tell that once, and if, and when this issue gets to be, under real terms, investigated, you will be seeing certain people that we know from this country standing trial; and they will be prosecuted criminally. I understand this administration and their anti-transparency, anti-accountability and their corrupt attitudes. But that aside, we are not made of only one branch of government. We are supposed to have a system of checks and balances. And I am saying, how about the other two branches? And putting the pressure on our representatives in the Senate and the Congress, and the court system. They should be counter-acting this corruption, but they are sitting there silent. And they are just an audience, just watching it happen. Senators Leahy and Grassley and Hatch have the obligation to do that. This needs to be demanded of them. People need to pick up their phones. They need to write to these people and say, \"You'd better fulfill your responsibilities.\" **JH:** There is an article in the April sixth TRUTHOUT by Paul Sperry from WorldNet Daily about you and one of your colleagues... **SE:** Mr. Sarshar? **JH:** Behrooz Sarshar. **SE:** He is another translator who worked in the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:5:62427a9ac337", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8524, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "it happen.

Mr. Sarshar wanted to make this information public, however he just wanted to go to the Senate Judiciary Committee and receive their support and protection under the whistleblower protection act. And I facilitated this meeting, and several 9/11 family members and I took Mr. Sarshar to the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in Senator Grassley's office. Mr. Sarshar provided them with detailed information, however, to this day Senator Grassley has not acted upon that, and he passed the buck to the 9/11 Commission. Next we arranged for a briefing between the 9/11 Commission and Mr. Sarshar, and he went there on February 12th, 2004 and he provided the investigators for the 9/11 Commission, for almost three hours with all the details of the investigation that had to do with the 9/11 terrorist attack. He gave them the names of certain assets used by the Bureau for at least twelve years. He gave them contact information for certain agents who were aware of these issues. And they, themselves, wanted to come and talk about it, but they needed certain protection. Mr. Sarshar provided them with all this information and where to look for these documents etc. and, to this day, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the 9/11 Commission have been passing this buck back and forth. So, all this information has been sitting in front of them. They have not called any of those witnesses introduced by Mr. Sarshar to them. And during the 9/11 Commission hearing with [FBI] Director Mueller, none of these questions were asked. In fact they did not have any questions for Director Mueller, and they left it at that [except for the remark by Mr. Ben-Veniste that they should be addressing the translation issues behind closed doors.] And \"behind closed doors\" has become a black hole for me because I have been in these closed door sessions so many times within the Senate, within the Inspector General's office, within the 9/11 Commission. And whatever information you are providing them behind these closed doors, you know for sure that that information will stay there and will never get out. That is why we are demanding to have public hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Senate floor and open to the public. **JH:** Do you think the Ellen Mariani case will help any of this? [Ellen Mariani is a 9/11 widow whose", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911whistlebloweredmonds.txt:6:c53ceaf8fa71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8525, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911whistlebloweredmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911whistlebloweredmonds", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Senate, within the Inspector General's office, within the 9/11 Commission. And whatever information you are providing them behind these closed doors, you know for sure that that information will stay there and will never get out. That is why we are demanding to have public hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Senate floor and open to the public. **JH:** Do you think the Ellen Mariani case will help any of this? [Ellen Mariani is a 9/11 widow whose attorney, Philip Berg, is suing the United States under the RICO statute for the death of Mr. Mariani at the WTC.] **SE:** I have read about her case. But there is another lawsuit: the Motley Rice legal firm that is representing over a thousand family members. They sent me a subpoena to provide them with a deposition. And one day before that deposition took place, the government attorneys intervened and asked the court for a hearing and they quashed this subpoena request. They sent eight heavyweight attorneys from the Department of Justice, and Mr. Ashcroft's right hand. And basically put on this show in front of the judge, saying, \"Sibel Edmonds, if you were to provide this information, our national security and our state secret privilege and our foreign relations will be destroyed. Therefore, Your Honor, we want you to quash this subpoena.\" Motley Rice told the judge that they wanted to ask for information that has already been made public. The government maintained that even though the information was public, it was still classified. And Judge Walton granted their request. **JH:** There is some hope coming from statements made by former FBI counterintelligence agent I.C.Smith who thinks that 9/11 would have been stopped, had the FBI been allowed to do its job. He is strongly critical of FBI assistant director Dale Watson. Do you believe that 9/11 could have been stopped if information like yours had been properly handled? **SE:** At the very least, as early as May/June 2001, we could have issued a red code alert to the public, and we would have issued this very urgent warning system, which would, in return, have increased our Airport and INS security. Could we have prevented in 100% certainty? I don't think anything is that certain. However, we would have had a very, very good chance for preventing it. And agent Smith and I, we crossed the same person, because my case has to do with Dale Watson too. **JH:** The trouble is: once you make this information public, you mess up the plan. And if one of the investigations from Phoenix, Chicago, New York, or Minneapolis had been followed through, let alone all four, it would have burst the bubble. **SE:** Look, Jim, they had those four pieces you mentioned, and far more than that, believe me, far more than that.

And that has not been made public. And for them to say that we did not have any specific information is just outrageous. Because what were they waiting for? An affidavit signed by bin Laden? **JH:** \"Hey Dumb Ass! Coming 9/11!\" So their statement that they didn't have the information is outrageous. **SE:** And they have been backing off from that. About two weeks before Condoleezza Rice appeared before the 9/11 Commission she made the statement, \"We had no specific information.\" And I told the press that that was an outrageous lie. That was printed on the front page of *The Independent* [UK] and several other papers here. And what she did during the hearing was very interesting. She corrected herself saying, \"Well, I made a mistake. I should not have said 'we.' I should say that I personally did not have specific information.\" And that is exactly what I stated. \"We\" includes the FBI, and therefore I can tell you with 100% certainty that that is an outrageous lie. Yet the Commission didn't ask, \"Well, who is the rest of this 'we'?\" **JH:** They don't want to know. **SE:** No, they don't want to know. This is the heart of it. The attitude of the Senate members has been \"See no evil. Hear no evil. Just let it go.\" And you can't let that happen. The only people I have seen who have been truly pushing for the truth are the family members. All they have asked for are three things. They want the truth, the facts, the real facts, the straightforward truth. They want accountability. And they want us to improve our security. That's it. They have no other agenda. And now they're smearing their names. **JH:** Well, they have to figure out the angle. **JH:** Ms. Edmonds, thanks for being our guest. **SE:** Thank you very much. I'm honored to be on your show and I hope I'll be on again. And I hope you will able to get Senator Leahy. I'd like to be able to have a chat with him. [Laughter] **JH:** Fat chance. He withers at the thought. **SE:** We're going to still be pounding. I'm preparing this petition, and it's going to be signed by many, many people and I'm going to be wheeling it in personally to both Senators Leahy and Grassley.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Jim Hogue provided the following conclusion to this interview: \"The facts reported by Sibel Edmonds and Behrooz Sarshar are incontrovertible. Result: Silence. And you must agree to be a part of this silence.The gag order permeates the White House, the Senate Judiciary Committee, all levels of the FBI, the CIA, the 9/11 Commission, the NSC, the Pentagon, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the mass media. The media and the White House will next assassinate Miss Edmond's character, as they have done to others who haven't rolled over and played dead. Never in the course of human events has so great a story been covered up by so many on the orders of so few.

Is Bosnia next?** by Mary Anne Weaver The Atlantic Monthly May, 1996 [http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96may/blowback.htm](http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96may/blowback.htm) One Friday evening, just after sunset prayers, Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman climbed into a camouflaged truck in Peshawar, Pakistan, and set off for his first trip inside Afghanistan. It was 1985, he told me later, and he had just spent three years in Egyptian prisons, where he had been severely tortured as he awaited trial on charges of issuing a fatwa resulting in the assassination of President Anwar Sadat; a military court later acquitted him of that, and of a related conspiracy charge. (Last January in New York the sheikh was sentenced to life imprisonment for seditious conspiracy to wage a \"war of urban terrorism against the United States.\") As he settled into the back seat of the U.S.-supplied truck, the sheikh, who was then forty-seven and had been blind since infancy, was helped into a flak jacket by the fundamentalist Afghan resistance leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar. At that time the Soviet Union was occupying Afghanistan, and the United States was supporting the Afghan resistance; Hekmatyar, though he was one of the most stridently anti-Western of the resistance leaders, was receiving roughly half the arms that the CIA was supplying. The sheikh had first met Hekmatyar in Saudi Arabia a number of years before, and they were friends. They had much in common: both were exceedingly charismatic religious populists; both had committed their lives to jihad, or Islamic holy war; both were fiery orators. They were both given to elliptical, colorful turns of phrase, and their shared message was clear: the imperative to overthrow a secular government -- whether in Afghanistan or Egypt -- and establish an Islamic state. Discuss this article in the Global Views forum of Post & Riposte. Return to Flashback: \"Coming to Grips with Jihad.\" Return to Flashback: \"The Triumph of Terrorism.\" Outside Peshawar the mountain passes came alive with men. The mujahideen were loading their caravans with AK-47s, mortars, grenades, and mines to return to Afghanistan. Mules and ponies strained under the weight of wooden crates strapped onto their backs. There were no identifying markings on the crates, nor were there any on the contents, but everything was pan of what would become Washington's largest covert-action program since Vietnam -- equipping fighters on the last battlefield of the Cold War. The truck in which Sheikh Omar was traveling joined a convoy of six or seven others and continued toward the Khyber Pass. The mujahideen preferred to move the arms supplied by the CIA on moonless nights, Nawab Salim, one of Hekmatyar's aides, explained later when he recounted the trip to me.

Salim accompanied the sheikh and Hekmatyar into Afghanistan that night; so did Muhammad Shawqi Islambouli, an Egyptian who was fighting in the war, and who was the elder brother of Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, the assassin of Anwar Sadat. The sun was just beginning to rise when the convoy reached its destination, a battlefield headquarters in the province of Jalalabad, some fifty miles northeast of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Everything there seemed to be highly improvised, and the headquarters consisted merely of a string of battered and pockmarked buildings built into the side of a strategic hill. For nearly two decades Sheikh Omar had preached his message of jihad throughout the Middle East. Now he was inside Afghanistan, where a jihad was actually taking place. \"My strongest emotion was pride,\" he told me afterward. \"I felt so proud of my religion, so proud of the power that Muslims had. And I knew that Allah would aid these people and this religion, and that Islam would be victorious in the end.\" Guided by Hekmatyar and Islambouli, the sheikh walked to a sandbagged position on the crest of the hill. From below, in the valley, came the echo of crashing artillery shells. He stood there for perhaps five minutes. \"He was weeping,\" Nawab Salim recalled. After a few moments Sheikh Omar turned toward Hekmatyar. \"I have never asked Allah for anything,\" he said. \"But I am under a great disadvantage now. If only Allah could give me eyes for a couple of years, or for a couple of hours, so I could fight in the jihad!\" LAST December 21, in a crowded market in Peshawar, the rugged Pakistani frontier town that had been the primary staging area for the jihad in Afghanistan, a car bomb exploded, killing thirty-six people and wounding about 120 more. Only a month earlier two similar car bombs -- one outside the Riyadh headquarters of a U.S. military training center for the Saudi National Guard, the other outside the Egyptian embassy in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad -- killed twenty-four people, including five Americans. The attack in Saudi Arabia was almost certainly aimed at the Saudi dynasty as well as at the United States. As for the car bombings in Pakistan, they followed threats from three militant Egyptian Islamist groups who demanded that the government of Pakistan stop extraditing those of their members -- all of them veterans of the jihad -- who had stayed on when the war came to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:960500atlantic.blowback.txt:1:a95ada3df1f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8531, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "960500atlantic.blowback.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "960500atlantic.blowback", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad -- killed twenty-four people, including five Americans.

As for the car bombings in Pakistan, they followed threats from three militant Egyptian Islamist groups who demanded that the government of Pakistan stop extraditing those of their members -- all of them veterans of the jihad -- who had stayed on when the war came to an end and were using Peshawar as a base. The groups also demanded that the government of the United States, for its part, release Sheikh Omar. One of the groups that claimed credit for the bombing in Saudi Arabia -- and one that has warned that there will be further attacks -- had participated in the jihad in Afghanistan, as had all three of the groups believed to have been involved in the November bombing in Islamabad. The sheikh and the CIA (and Saudi Arabia) had been obsessed with driving out the Soviets. As a result the CIA helped to train and fund what eventually became an international network of highly disciplined and effective Islamic militants -- and a new breed of terrorist as well. Speaking of the bombings, a former U.S. diplomat specializing in Saudi Arabia told me recently, \"Whether the attacks were carried out by the same or allied Islamic militant groups is not the most important thing. What is far more troubling is that these attacks illustrate the changing nature of terrorism since the Cold War. There's been a marked decline in the fairly well funded, ideologically organized groups like the Red Brigades. More and more we're seeing a proliferation of amorphous underground Islamic groups that we've never heard of before.\" He added that larger numbers of people are prone to enter the new-style groups. \"That, to me, is highly worrisome. Their operations are easy to do. They're basically low-tech. Sure, a certain amount of training is required -- and then you go to a feedstore and to a Radio Shack. The common element in all these attacks -- whether in Cairo or Riyadh, Isla or Algiers, Europe or New York -- is today's equivalent of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade: the 'Afghan Arabs,' the veterans of the Afghanistan war.\" SIXTEEN years have passed since the CIA began providing weapons and funds -- eventually totaling more than $3 billion -- to a fratricidal alliance of seven Afghan resistance groups, none of whose leaders are by nature democratic, and all of which are fundamentalist in religion to some extent, autocratic in politics, and venomously anti-American. Washington's financial commitment to the jihad was exceeded only by Saudi Arabia's. At the time the jihad was getting under way there was no significant Islamist opposition movement in Saudi Arabia, and it apparently never occurred to the Saudi rulers, who feared the Soviets", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:960500atlantic.blowback.txt:2:8aa8a1e33427", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8532, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "960500atlantic.blowback.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "960500atlantic.blowback", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "billion -- to a fratricidal alliance of seven Afghan resistance groups, none of whose leaders are by nature democratic, and all of which are fundamentalist in religion to some extent, autocratic in politics, and venomously anti-American.

At the time the jihad was getting under way there was no significant Islamist opposition movement in Saudi Arabia, and it apparently never occurred to the Saudi rulers, who feared the Soviets as much as Washington did, that the volunteers it sent might be converted by the jihad's ideology. Therein lies the greatest paradox of the bombing in Riyadh: it and the explosions in Peshawar and Islamabad could well prove to be part of the negative fallout -- or \"blowback,\" in intelligence parlance -- of the U.S.- and Saudi-orchestrated Afghan jihad. The bombings -- the first such terrorist attack in Saudi history, and among the worst in Pakistan's -- were the clearest warnings yet of an ominous escalation in the conflicts between the governments in Cairo and Riyadh and their Islamist foes. And the carnage in Islamabad -- the fourth attack against the Egyptian govrnment abroad in recent months (Mubarak narrowly survived an assassination attempt in Addis Ababa) -- indicated that Egypt's militant Islamic groups, facing an increasingly vengeful crackdown at home, were transferring their four-year-old war to the international front. U.S. policymakers were stunned. In less than a week the vulnerabilities of three of Washington's pivotal regional allies had become clear. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan had all served U.S. interests during the jihad Afghanistan; none appears able to cope with its aftermath. Mubarak's anger was palpable when he told me, months before the bombings, that he laid the blame for Islamist terrorism squarely on Pakistan, for, in his words, failing to \"clean up\" Peshawar and its environs. Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's bewilderment after the bombings was evident, as she once again faulted the United States and the CIA, which she accused of continuing to finance Pakistan's radical Muslim clerics and fundamentalist groups. As for the rulers of Saudi Arabia, whose princes and foundations, ironically, remain the leading benefactors of many of the militant Islamic groups in a shortsighted attempt to placate the kingdom's expanding fundamentalist constituency, they seemed shaken out of their placidity. And government officials in all three capitals began to wonder, as they redoubled their efforts against terrorism, whether the Islamists could still be contained. For more than a decade some 25,000 Islamic militants, from nearly thirty countries around the world, had streamed through Peshawar on their way to the jihad. They came, without passports and without names, from the Palestinian organization Hamas, from Egypt's AlGama'a al-Islamiya and Al-Jihad, from Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front, and from the Philippines' Moro Liberation Front.

Five years after the jihad ended, a thousand or so remained, some in Peshawar itself, others encamped in the mountain passes of the ungovernable tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, planning and executing what investigators now believe were terrorist acts that have reached from Cairo to Algiers, Manila to Bangkok -- and to the streets of Islamabad. Riyadh, Peshawar, and New York. \"Even today you can sit at the Khyber Pass and see every color, every creed, every nationality, pass,\" a Western diplomat told me in Peshawar last spring. \"These groups, in their wildest imagination, never would have met if there had been no jihad. For a Moro to get a Sting missile! To make contacts with Islamists from North Africa! The United States created a Moscow Central in Peshawar for these groups, and the consequences for all of us are astronomical.\" The diplomat went on to say that many veterans of the Afghan jihad have set up an informal network of small, loosely organized underground cells, with support centers scattered around the world: in the United States, the Persian Gulf countries, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The days of mule trains like the one Sheikh Omar joined en route to Afghanistan are long gone; now E-mail and faxes drive the jihad. PEOPLE in the Peshawar bazaars and in the overcrowded refugee camps still remember Sheikh Omar from the war years. A short, rotund man, dressed in long gray clerical robes and a red fezlike cap with a wide white band, he was easily distinguishable by his blindness and by his full gray-white beard, which rested on his chest. It was in Peshawar that Sheikh Omar became involved with the U.S. and Pakistani intelligence officials who were orchestrating the war. The sixty or so CIA and Special Forces officers based there considered him a \"valuable asset,\" according to one of them, and overlooked his anti-Western message and incitement to holy war because they wanted him to help unify the mujahideen groups. Unifying the groups, which had been fighting among themselves for years, proved impossible even for Sheikh Omar. but he did succeed in coordinating some of their activities. As he did so, he favored the two most anti-Western and fundamentalist of them -- one led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the other by Professor Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf, who, like the sheikh, held a Ph.D. from the University of al-Azhar, in Cairo.

A swashbuckling figure, often draped in blankets of homespun cloth, Sayyaf had taught at Kabul University, but his power base inside Afghanistan was limited. Nevertheless, largely because he was an adherent of the puritanical Wahhabi school of Islam (the dominant school in Saudi Arabia), Riyadh funded him lavishly. But Sheikh Omar's closest friend in Peshawar was a highly respected Palestinian, Sheikh Abdullah Azzam, a man of erudition, refinement, and eloquence, who also had a Ph.D. from Al-Azhar but was everything the blustering Sayyaf was not. Like Sheikh Omar, he had been a professor of shari'a law (at the University of Jordan) before joining the jihad. Azzam became the pivotal figure in the Arab world in popularizing the cause. What was called the Service Office, which he led until November of 1989, when he was killed by a still-unidentified assassin, was the largest recruitment center in Peshawar, perhaps in the world, for Arab volunteers. It became, in a sense, the nexus for the pan-Islamic effort both inside and -- after the Soviet occupation ended, in 1989 -- outside Afghanistan. Money flowed into the Service Office from the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Sheikh Azzam belonged. But the heaviest funding, which may have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars, came from Saudi Arabia -- some directly from the Saudi government, some from official mosques, and some from Saudi princes and members of the kingdom's financial and business elite. Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, the governor of Riyadh, who headed a support committee that funded the Arab mujahideen, was a heavy contributor, as was the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, who chairs the immensely powerful Muslim World League, the main conduit for Saudi government funds to Islamic causes worldwide. As was and is true of much of Saudi Arabia's clandestine funding abroad, the league's funds were often distributed somewhat indiscriminately. The Service Office set up branches in Europe and the United States as the war progressed. East Coast efforts in the United States centered on the Alkifah Refugee Center, on Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue. More than 200 Arabs and Arab-Americans were recruited and sent to the jihad. As Sheikh Azzam recruited, Sheikh Omar preached. Generally flying first-class, he carried his message of jihad from Pakistani refugee camps to the towns of upper Egypt, into Saudi Arabian mosques, and to Islamic centers in Germany, England, Turkey, and the United States.

During his travels, over nearly five years, Sheikh Omar's stature continued to grow, as he shored up old friendships and made new ones along the way. He always kept in mind his ultimate goal: the establishment in Egypt of an Islamic state. Planning ahead, he cultivated men whose assistance would eventually lead to the formation of an international support network for his activities -- an axis that would link Europe and the United States with Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The sheikh met frequently during those years, in London and Khartoum, with Hassan al-Turabi, the erudite Islamist who today effectively controls the rigid Islamic government in Sudan (whence U.S. diplomats were withdrawn in February because of fears of terrorist attacks). He wooed Pakistani generals, many of whom were, and are, committed Islamists, and all of whom were charmed by Sheikh Omar's extraordinary knowledge of the Koran. And he returned to Saudi Arabia, where he had previously lived, there proving adept at exploiting political divisions within the ruling establishment. Two of his most abiding friendships, however, turned out to be with his traveling companions on that 1985 trip. Gulbaddin Hekmatyar was named Prime Minister of Afghanistan in 1992, when the puppet Communist government in Kabul finally fell. The fighting continued, now in the form of a fratricidal civil war in which Hekmatyar unleashed a deadly offensive against other factions of the mujahideen, using a formidable arsenal of arms -- all of them supplied by the United States and Saudi Arabia. (Ironically, Hekmatyar and the present leaders of the Afghan government, who among them have stockpiled some 500 \"missing\" Stinger anti-aircraft missiles supplied by the CIA, are now being challenged by a new and extremely fundamentalist Afghan student militia known as the Taliban, which grew out of the chaos left by the CIA's war. With the strong backing of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, it has managed to wrest control of nearly half of the country -- and several Stingers -- from the leaders of the jihad.) Muhammad Islambouli, who at one time was a student of Sheikh Omar's at the Upper Egyptian University of Asyut, has since that trip in 1985 become a leading figure in Egypt's militant Islamic Group, or Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya, the first organization to claim responsibility for the Islamabad bomb. The group's spiritual mentor is Sheikh Omar. Like hundreds of other Egyptians who fought in the jihad, Islambouli now divides his time among Europe and Peshawar and the battlefields of Afghanistan, all of which serve as organizational centers or training grounds", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:960500atlantic.blowback.txt:6:8b94470c128a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8536, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "960500atlantic.blowback.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "960500atlantic.blowback", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "student of Sheikh Omar's at the Upper Egyptian University of Asyut, has since that trip in 1985 become a leading figure in Egypt's militant Islamic Group, or Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya, the first organization to claim responsibility for the Islamabad bomb. The group's spiritual mentor is Sheikh Omar. Like hundreds of other Egyptians who fought in the jihad, Islambouli now divides his time among Europe and Peshawar and the battlefields of Afghanistan, all of which serve as organizational centers or training grounds for Egypt's militant Islamic groups. WHEN Sheikh Omar entered the United States, in July of 1990, via Saudi Arabia, Peshawar, and Sudan on a much-disputed tourist visa issued by an undercover agent of the CIA, his primary purpose was to set up a U.S. infrastructure, a funding mechanism, and an organizational base for Egypt's militant Islamic groups -- an undertaking that he had largely accomplished by the time of his arrest in 1993. Many of his followers remained in Peshawar, however, and continued their work. Some teamed up with other militant Islamist groups, including a cadre of demolitions and weapons experts from the Saudi Islamic Movement for Change, which claimed responsibility for the Riyadh car bomb. Others were instructors or trainees in the dozen or so military training camps that hugged the Pakistani-Afghan border on both sides. Still others went off in search of new jihads, in Tajikistan or Kashmir, or joined some 3,000 veterans of the jihad who went as volunteers to Bosnia, where, easily distinguishable by their dark beards, they fought alongside the predominantly Muslim Bosnian army for two years. Last October the Afghan veterans vowed to kill five British soldiers in the United Nations force in retaliation for the death of a Bosnian fundamentalist who had pointed a gun at a British soldier and was shot by him. They are also suspected of having murdered an American employee of the UN. Now there is concern that the jihad veterans will engage in acts against U.S. troops -- a concern that turned to alarm in February, when militant Islamist groups vowed to strike back at U.S. targets in retaliation for the sentencing of Sheikh Omar. AS they sifted through the rubble of the former Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, investigators, including agents from the FBI (which also has agents in Riyadh), attempted to determine what, if any, links exist between the two attacks, each of which involved more than a thousand pounds of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil -- the same highly combustible mixture used in the World Trade Center bombing in New York. \"The bomb in Riyadh is of far greater interest to me,\" the former U.S. diplomat specializing in Saudi Arabia told me. \"The one in Islamabad was more comprehensible, and highly predictable. Riyadh was not. Never before has the Saudi Islamic opposition been so emboldened. In a sense they ripped off the veil.\" About a thousand", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:960500atlantic.blowback.txt:7:981862b1a860", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8537, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "960500atlantic.blowback.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "960500atlantic.blowback", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "a thousand pounds of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil -- the same highly combustible mixture used in the World Trade Center bombing in New York. \"The bomb in Riyadh is of far greater interest to me,\" the former U.S. diplomat specializing in Saudi Arabia told me. \"The one in Islamabad was more comprehensible, and highly predictable. Riyadh was not. Never before has the Saudi Islamic opposition been so emboldened. In a sense they ripped off the veil.\" About a thousand Saudis had fought in the jihad. Largely funded and supported by their government, they came from good and wealthy families. I asked the diplomat what, in his view, made the Saudis different from other Islamists who came to the jihad. \"Their government sent them,\" he responded. \"It was the patriotic thing to do. But when these guys got there, they met others and began to network; they found a whole new world out there. And despite their wealth, they were underemployed, frustrated, an accident waiting to happen -- and it did. Also, unlike the others who went to Afghanistan as members of Islamic groups -- Gama'a, Al-Jihad, Hamas, and the like -- there were no organized Saudi groups. That's what makes these guys very different: they set up the networks when they came home.\" Other U.S. officials agree, and warn that despite the Saudi government's efforts to blame the usual regional suspects -- Iran, Iraq, and Sudan -- for the car bombing, the Islamist discontent in Saudi Arabia is real, and the movement is basically homegrown. One of its most charismatic and powerful champions is Osama bin Laden, the billionaire scion of a leading Saudi family. Fervent and devout, he was described to me by one U.S. intelligence official as \"a religious fanatic with enormous wealth -- a man with a vision, who knows precisely how he wants to convert that vision into reality.\" Bin Laden worked closely with Saudi intelligence and with Prince Salman, the governor of Riyadh, in funding the jihad, and eventually came to Peshawar as a mujahid himself. There he befriended Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and Sheikh Omar, and fought with the forces of Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf. He now divides his time between Khartoum and London, where he owns opulent estates, and he places his formidable wealth at the disposal of militant Islamic groups around the world. Muhammad Jamal Khalifa, Bin Laden's brother-in-law and a Saudi financier, was a prime conduit for funding militant Islamic groups in the Philippines, Filipino officials assert; and, according to U.S. investigators, there is evidence that during the mid-1990s, when Khalifa was the head of the Islamic Relief Agency -- a quasi-government Saudi charity -- in the Philippines, he had contact with Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, alleged to be the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing in New York.

Three years ago, at U.S. urging, the Saudi government stripped Bin Laden of his citizenship because of his \"irresponsible behavior ... and his refusal to obey instructions issued to him.\" When I asked a U.S. counterterrorism expert what this meant, he replied, \"Osama was warned by Saudi intelligence: Do nothing against us and we'll leave you alone.\" Bin Laden ignored the warnings, and the Saudis began running intelligence operations against him and his entourage in Khartoum; at the time of the Bush Administration -- presumably with U.S. knowledge -- they had secretly dispatched hit teams with a contract on his life. When the U.S. military headquarters in Saudi Arabia was blown apart, the expert said, \"Osama bin Laden was the first guy who came up on the radar screen in Riyadh.\" Some months earlier, when I asked Hosni Mubarak about Bin Laden, he winced. \"He wants to take over the world,\" he said. \"He's a megalomaniac.\" Mubarak then expressed both annoyance and concern about what he saw as the passive attitude of Western governments, particularly those of Britain, Germany, and the United States, in permitting militant Egyptian Islamic groups to operate freely from their soil. But he voiced his greatest concern -- rage, really -- about Peshawar and the veterans of the jihad. He told me about a meeting he had had in Bonn, in April of 1993, with Benazir Bhutto's predecessor, Nawaz Sharif. \"It was a tough meeting,\" he said. \"And I couldn't believe my ears: this man was the leader of Pakistan and he told me, quite frankly, 'We cannot control Peshawar. We cannot prevent these people from running loose.' I asked him then if he wanted me to send the Egyptian armed forces to Peshawar to clean up the mess.\" Mubarak may finally be getting his wish. Within a week of the Islamabad bombing Pakistani security forces fanned out across Pakistan and arrested more than 300 people, including numerous militant Pakistani clerics and fundamentalists, some sixty Afghans, and two dozen or so Arabs, some from Peshawar, others from Islamabad. (One, a Saudi national who had arrived in Pakistan during the jihad, was deported in February to Saudi Arabia in connection with his alleged involvement in the car bombing in Riyadh.)

The university's primary benefactors have been the Saudis, who, according to Pakistani officials, used the university as a cover during the jihad for the funneling of fighters, money, and arms. In the last days of December, Sheikh Omar confounded prison officials by refusing to take his medications for diabetes, high blood pressure, and a heart condition, and thus became a prisoner of great concern to the U.S. government. When I saw him last year, I asked how he felt now that, having worked along side the governments of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States in Afghanistan, he was facing charges in the United States that could imprison him for life. Many of his followers in Egypt and Saudi Arabia who had fought in the jihad were being tried and imprisoned, and a number had been hanged in Egypt, solely for participating in that war. \"We have an expression in Arabic,\" he replied. \"'Everybody sings for those whom he loves.' In effect, it means that everyone is singing for something different. And that is exactly what happened in Afghanistan. Do you think we were naive enough to believe that the United States government was helping the Afghans because it believed in their cause -- to raise the flag of jihad for Islam? That they were helping a people, a country, to free themselves? Absolutely not. The Americans were there to punish the Soviet Union, and when they were sure that the Soviet Union had suffered and was about to collapse, they stopped everything -- all the aid, all the equipment -- just like that.\" He snapped his fingers, and his voice began to rise. \"They didn't care that there was still a Communist government in power in Afghanistan.

Bin Laden comes home to roost His CIA ties are only the beginning of a woeful story [By Michael Moran](mailto:michael.moran@msnbc.com) MSNBC NEW YORK, Aug. 24, 1998 - At the CIA, it happens often enough to have a code name: Blowback. Simply defined, this is the term that describes an agent, an operative or an operation that has turned on its creators. Osama bin Laden, our new public enemy Number 1, is the personification of blowback. And the fact that he is viewed as a hero by millions in the Islamic world proves again the old adage: Reap what you sow. BEFORE YOU CLICK on my face and call me naive, let me concede some points. Yes, the West needed Josef Stalin to defeat Hitler. Yes, there were times during the Cold War when supporting one villain (Cambodia's Lon Nol, for instance) would have been better than the alternative (Pol Pot). So yes, there are times when any nation must hold its nose and shake hands with the devil for the long-term good of the planet. But just as surely, there are times when the United States, faced with such moral dilemmas, should have resisted the temptation to act. Arming a multi-national coalition of Islamic extremists in Afghanistan during the 1980s - well after the destruction of the Marine barracks in Beirut or the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - was one of those times. BIN LADEN'S BEGINNINGS As anyone who has bothered to read this far certainly knows by now, bin Laden is the heir to Saudi construction fortune who, at least since the early 1990s, has used that money to finance countless attacks on U.S. interests and those of its Arab allies around the world. As his unclassified CIA biography states, bin Laden left Saudi Arabia to fight the Soviet army in Afghanistan after Moscow's invasion in 1979. By 1984, he was running a front organization known as Maktab al-Khidamar - the MAK - which funneled money, arms and fighters from the outside world into the Afghan war. What the CIA bio conveniently fails to specify (in its unclassified form, at least) is that the MAK was nurtured by Pakistan's state security services, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, the CIA's primary conduit for conducting the covert war against Moscow's occupation. By no means was Osama bin Laden the leader of Afghanistan's mujahedeen. His money gave him undue prominence", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:980824msnbclead.txt:0:b2eb9f40518a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8542, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "980824msnbclead.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "980824msnbclead", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "al-Khidamar - the MAK - which funneled money, arms and fighters from the outside world into the Afghan war. What the CIA bio conveniently fails to specify (in its unclassified form, at least) is that the MAK was nurtured by Pakistan's state security services, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, the CIA's primary conduit for conducting the covert war against Moscow's occupation. By no means was Osama bin Laden the leader of Afghanistan's mujahedeen. His money gave him undue prominence in the Afghan struggle, but the vast majority of those who fought and died for Afghanistan's freedom - like the Taliban regime that now holds sway over most of that tortured nation - were Afghan nationals. Yet the CIA, concerned about the factionalism of Afghanistan made famous by Rudyard Kipling, found that Arab zealots who flocked to aid the Afghans were easier to \"read\" than the rivalry-ridden natives. While the Arab volunteers might well prove troublesome later, the agency reasoned, they at least were one-dimensionally anti-Soviet for now. So bin Laden, along with a small group of Islamic militants from Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian refugee camps all over the Middle East, became the \"reliable\" partners of the CIA in its war against Moscow. WHAT'S 'INTELLIGENT' ABOUT THIS? Though he has come to represent all that went wrong with the CIA's reckless strategy there, by the end of the Afghan war in 1989, bin Laden was still viewed by the agency as something of a dilettante - a rich Saudi boy gone to war and welcomed home by the Saudi monarchy he so hated as something of a hero. In fact, while he returned to his family's construction business, bin Laden had split from the relatively conventional MAK in 1988 and established a new group, al-Qaida, that included many of the more extreme MAK members he had met in Afghanistan. Most of these Afghan vets, or *Afghanis*, as the Arabs who fought there became known, turned up later behind violent Islamic movements around the world. Among them: the GIA in Algeria, thought responsible for the massacres of tens of thousands of civilians; Egypt's Gamat Ismalia, which has massacred western tourists repeatedly in recent years; Saudi Arabia Shiite militants, responsible for the Khobar Towers and Riyadh bombings of 1996. Indeed, to this day, those involved in the decision to give the Afghan rebels access to a fortune in covert funding and top-level combat weaponry continue to defend that move in the context of the Cold War. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee making those decisions, told my colleague Robert Windrem that he would make the same call again today even knowing what bin Laden would do subsequently. \"It was worth it,\" he said. \"Those were very important, pivotal matters that played an important role in the downfall of the Soviet Union,\" he said.

HINDSIGHT OR TUNNEL VISION It should be pointed out that the evidence of bin Laden's connection to these activities is mostly classified, though its hard to imagine the CIA rushing to take credit for a Frankenstein's monster like this. It is also worth acknowledging that it is easier now to oppose the CIA's Afghan adventures than it was when Hatch and company made them in the mid-1980s. After all, in 1998 we now know that far larger elements than Afghanistan were corroding the communist party's grip on power in Moscow. Even Hatch can't be blamed completely. The CIA, ever mindful of the need to justify its \"mission,\" had conclusive evidence by the mid-1980s of the deepening crisis of infrastructure within the Soviet Union. The CIA, as its deputy director Robert Gates acknowledged under congressional questioning in 1992, had decided to keep that evidence from President Reagan and his top advisors and instead continued to grossly exaggerate Soviet military and technological capabilities in its annual \"Soviet Military Power\" report right up to 1990. Given that context, a decision was made to provide America's potential enemies with the arms, money - and most importantly - the knowledge of how to run a war of attrition violent and well-organized enough to humble a superpower. That decision is coming home to roost. *[Michael Moran](mailto:Michael.Moran@msnbc.com) is MSNBC's International Editor* FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Dec. 21, 1998 Inside The Hunt For Osama **The Feds have tailed the Saudi and his secret network for years. So why didn't they stop the Africa bombings?** BY DOUGLAS WALLER/WASHINGTON The exercise was code-named Poised Response. Attorney General Janet Reno had invited 200 policemen from the Washington metropolitan area to the FBI's headquarters last Oct. 14 to plan how they'd react to a terrorist attack in the nation's capital. They settled in that Wednesday morning to consider four scenarios: a car-bomb attack, a chemical-weapons strike on a Washington Redskins football game, the planting of an explosive device in a federal building and an assassination attempt on Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State. But the war game--intended to help the agencies practice working together--quickly melted down into interagency squabbling and finger pointing. Reno left the session feeling uneasy--understandably so, say Administration officials. Poised Response was anything but poised. And while the cops involved were never told which terrorist might carry out such an audacious attack, Reno and other top Administration aides had one man in mind: Osama bin Laden, whose Afghan camp had been blasted by U.S. cruise missiles two months earlier. His operatives might be coming to town soon. **Intelligence sources tell TIME they have evidence that bin Laden may be planning his boldest move yet--a strike on Washington or possibly New York City** in an eye-for-an-eye retaliation. \"We've hit his headquarters, now he hits ours,\" says a State Department aide. The hand-wringing and brainstorming are part of what Albright calls \"the war of the future\"--a battle in which the foot soldiers are elusive terrorists and the agents are in pursuit. The enemy in this case is a 41-year-old Goldfinger with a bank account of $100 million to $300 million, a far-flung network of cohorts and a fiery hatred for the U.S., which he badly wants out of Saudi Arabia, his homeland. The bloodiest round of this new war came on Aug. 7 when bin Laden's agents allegedly bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, 12 of them Americans.

Those simultaneous attacks were the most devastating terror assault the U.S. has suffered overseas since the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Though Washington retaliated 13 days later, with cruise-missile strikes at Osama's base in Afghanistan, U.S. officials are still licking their wounds. The bin Laden attacks came despite a four-year secret campaign by the U.S. government to contain and control his activities--a frustrating war of attrition in which Washington has both won and lost battles. American agents have tracked, arrested and interrogated members of Osama's terror cells in dozens of countries. Now two government inquiries--one by the CIA's inspector general, the other by a State Department Accountability Review Board--have begun to raise a troubling question: Could the East Africa attacks have been prevented? The targeting of Osama's network began in earnest almost two years after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000. On a chilly, clear February night in 1995, a helicopter soared over the Hudson River to the FBI's office at New York City's Federal Plaza. Sitting blindfolded in the chopper next to the bureau's Lewis Schiliro was Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the Trade Center attack, who had just been nabbed in Pakistan. During the transatlantic leg of the flight back to the U.S., Yousef had bragged that his original plan had been to plant enough explosives in one of the 110-story twin buildings to topple it, killing maybe 250,000 people in the tower and on the ground. But his shoestring operation couldn't afford enough dynamite, and settled for a much smaller blast. As the chopper neared the Trade Center, agents removed Yousef's blindfold. \"See?\" said one. \"It's still standing.\" Yousef squinted at the high-rise. \"Next time, if I have more money,\" he finally said, \"I'll knock it down.\" Schiliro, who's now running the FBI's investigation of the Africa bombings, remembers feeling a chill run through his body. His fellow agents had already discovered that the terrorist now had the cash to back up his threat. Yousef apparently had a benefactor, a wealthy Saudi expatriate named Osama bin Laden, who in the 1980s had bankrolled mujahedin guerrillas fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan and who had fled his Saudi homeland after he had been charged with inciting fundamentalist opposition to the country's royal family. Until then, the FBI and the CIA considered bin Laden, son of a Saudi construction magnate, to be a \"Gucci terrorist\" with a fat wallet and a big mouth.

Until then, the FBI and the CIA considered bin Laden, son of a Saudi construction magnate, to be a \"Gucci terrorist\" with a fat wallet and a big mouth. His followers were a loosely bound group of former Afghan freedom fighters called al Qaeda, meaning (military) base. But bin Laden was moving into the big leagues. Al Qaeda operatives or sympathizers are accused of attacking American soldiers in Somalia, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. They had plans to kidnap U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf, and they might have U.S.-made Stinger missiles left over from the Afghan war. Worse, intelligence officials discovered that by 1993 bin Laden had begun hunting for nuclear weapons. First on his shopping list was a Russian nuclear warhead he hoped to buy on the black market. He abandoned that effort when no warhead could be found. Instead, his agents began scouring former Soviet republics for enriched uranium and weapons components that could be used to set off the fuel. Fortunately, \"Osama's buyers weren't physicists, and the people selling to him were trying to rip him off,\" says an Energy Department official. The enriched uranium they were offered turned out to be low-grade reactor fuel unusable for a weapon. Another con man tried to sell them radioactive garbage, claiming it was \"red mercury,\" a supposedly lethal Russian bomb the CIA says never existed. Frustrated, bin Laden instead settled on chemical weapons, which are easier to manufacture. Although U.S. intelligence officials have been unable to pinpoint hidden caches, they suspect that during a five-year stay in Sudan before moving to Afghanistan in 1996, bin Laden tested, with the help of Sudanese officials, nerve agents that would be dispensed from bombs or artillery shells. By the end of 1995 President Clinton signed a top-secret order, approved by the congressional intelligence committees, that authorized the CIA to begin covert operations to break up bin Laden's terror network. The agency's counterterrorism center--200 operatives housed in a windowless warren of cubicles in the CIA's Langley, Va., headquarters--had set up a special bin Laden task force. Analysts were assigned to read every word the Saudi had spoken or written. Computers with sophisticated \"link analysis\" programs were busy printing out diagrams of bin Laden's loose-knit network, which included thousands of Muslim fighters with varying degrees of allegiance to him in almost a dozen countries.

Using its own informants plus the counterterrorism center's computers, which tracks passports worldwide, the CIA would spot bin Laden operatives in foreign countries, then quietly enlist the local security service to arrest or deport them and allow the agency to sift through materials left in their apartments. In many cases, the CIA didn't know \"exactly what each person was doing,\" says an intelligence official, \"just that he was doing something with a terror organization, so we should disrupt it.\" One operation would produce clues that led to another. For example, a CIA analyst perusing a slip of paper scooped up in one raid realized that scribbled on it was part of a phone number for a bin Laden cell in another country. That cell became the next target and yielded another round of evidence. The CIA had a similar \"disruption operation\" under way in Kenya a year before the bombing. The agency's station in Nairobi is one of the busiest in Africa, responsible for keeping watch as well on the war-torn countries of Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Kenya, CIA and embassy security officers believed the biggest threat to Americans was common crime. But the risk of terror lurked below the surface. Nairobi had become a transit stop for Iranian and Sudanese intelligence agents. Along the country's Indian Ocean coast were Kenyan veterans of the Afghan war that bin Laden agents had been recruiting. By August 1997 the CIA had identified a bin Laden cell operating in Nairobi. The agency believed it was headed by Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese who held American citizenship and who, according to court documents, once served as bin Laden's personal secretary. Washington sent a secret request to Kenyan authorities in Nairobi: roust Wadih el Hage. For several weeks Kenyan police, sometimes accompanied by visiting FBI agents, began paying visits to el Hage's Nairobi home, searching its rooms, confiscating computer disks and darkly warning him that he'd face more hassling if he remained in the country. The raids never uncovered a list of operatives in the cell but did rattle many of the members. One typed on el Hage's computer a \"security report\" to a senior bin Laden aide complaining that \"the cell is at 100% danger\" because", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:981221time.txt:3:d0a160b789a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8549, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "981221time.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "981221time", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "weeks Kenyan police, sometimes accompanied by visiting FBI agents, began paying visits to el Hage's Nairobi home, searching its rooms, confiscating computer disks and darkly warning him that he'd face more hassling if he remained in the country. The raids never uncovered a list of operatives in the cell but did rattle many of the members. One typed on el Hage's computer a \"security report\" to a senior bin Laden aide complaining that \"the cell is at 100% danger\" because of hostile intelligence agencies. FBI agents believe the report's author was Abdullah Mohammed Fazul, whom the CIA at the time had identified only as a distant associate of el Hage's. He was later accused of being a key planner of the embassy bombings the next year. El Hage moved with his family to Texas, where he lived and worked as a tire repairman until he was charged this fall with conspiracy in the Africa bombings. Meanwhile, the CIA station conducted another covert operation in Kenya. It was prompted by a tipster who walked into the Nairobi embassy in September 1997 and claimed that seven Arabs who worked for a local Islamic charity had connections with a bin Laden terror group. The agency confirmed that there were indirect ties, so Kenyan authorities deported the men to their home countries, and CIA officers began sifting through all the documents left behind. State Department officials now question whether the CIA missed clues to a future attack in those papers. Intelligence officials insist that none of the evidence taken revealed a bombing plot. Bin Laden definitely had a cell in Nairobi, the CIA reported to the embassy at the time, but the agency had no idea what he planned to do with it. Bin Laden had made plenty of public threats against the U.S., but the CIA believed he would be most likely to carry them out in Persian Gulf countries, where there was a U.S. military presence he hated, not in East Africa. Two months later, in November 1997, another informant walked into the Nairobi embassy. He was Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, an Egyptian, who warned that unnamed terrorists planned to car bomb the compound. Ahmed had details about the planned attack--details that would end up being eerily similar to what happened in the bombing nine months later. (He is under arrest in Dar es Salaam, accused in the Tanzania embassy blast.) CIA officers grilled Ahmed for days but finally concluded he was making up the tale. If an informant is credible, the agency often dispatches a special countersurveillance unit, nicknamed the snapshot team, which will sit in the embassy, wearing night-vision goggles from dusk to dawn, and peer out windows to spot terrorists casing the building.

No snapshot team was dispatched to Nairobi. Instead, the station sent out another warning report: Ahmed is probably fabricating the story, but he could be telling the truth, or he could be approaching the embassy to check its security. It was the kind of report embassy security officers detest. A warning that tells you everything and nothing. Nevertheless, extra guards were posted at the front and back of the building, and nervous security officers convinced their ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, to fire off a letter to Albright warning that the embassy was vulnerable to car bombs. But Nairobi's remained low on the priority list of embassies due for major security upgrades. For the next nine months, East Africa went off the intelligence radar screen. No more CIA reports of terror threats were delivered to the Nairobi embassy. In hindsight, it was probably a tip-off that something bad might happen. Terror cells go quiet before they attack. The CIA thought it had busted up the bin Laden cell, but during the silent period, \"the B-team came in,\" says a U.S. intelligence official. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, trained in explosives at a bin Laden camp, eventually joined Fazul in Nairobi to organize the strike. The CIA was battling bin Laden on additional fronts. In the spring of 1998, a small CIA-FBI team collected intelligence on him by parking itself at what agents call the \"zero line,\" Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. Back at Langley, CIA and Army special-operations officers drafted contingency plans for commandos to fight their way into Afghanistan for a snatch. CIA director George Tenet nixed the operation, fearing too many U.S. casualties. But in June the agency scored a win. CIA officers working with Albanian police grabbed four members of a bin Laden-affiliated group, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, who planned to bomb the U.S. embassy in Tirana. It was before sunrise in Langley on Aug. 7 when the bombs went off in Africa. Within hours of the blast, the CIA's counter-terrorism officers began crowding into their \"fusion center,\" a small room used to monitor terror crises overseas that is crammed with computers and large screens displaying satellite photos. The carpet still had burn marks from the time an excited Tenet dropped his cigar upon learning that CIA officers had apprehended Mir Amal Kasi, who had murdered two agency employees outside Langley. Tension was high as early casualty figures flowed in from Africa. Almost immediately, the CIA officers had a good idea who triggered the explosions at Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.

Tension was high as early casualty figures flowed in from Africa. Almost immediately, the CIA officers had a good idea who triggered the explosions at Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The bin Laden cell. The covert operation the year before apparently had not cleaned out that nest of terrorists. The conclusion hardened within days. The FBI took Odeh and al-'Owhali into custody in Nairobi, and they began spilling secrets. The security protecting bin Laden's network was porous, and other informants began talking, revealing that bin Laden planned assaults on other U.S. embassies in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Though the U.S. soon flexed its military muscle with the cruise-missile strike against bin Laden, and his network has been quiet for four months, Washington still sees him as a major threat. The White House has ordered stepped-up efforts to disrupt the terror network, but with mixed results. Treasury Department officials have made no headway dismantling bin Laden's financial empire. Most of his investments are in European or African companies that are unaffected by U.S. economic sanctions and don't deal in dollars, which Treasury could track. The State Department, likewise, has not convinced Afghanistan's ruling Taliban to evict bin Laden so the FBI can get its hands on him. The Pentagon is still looking at targets to hit, and the CIA continues covert operations to trip up bin Laden operatives. His aides have recently been arrested in Britain and Germany. Three months ago, intelligence sources tell TIME, the CIA broke up a bin Laden ring that had been planning an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan. Egyptian terrorists identified in the plot were deported to Cairo. Washington remains sure that bin Laden will strike back. And when he draws blood again, all the past covert operations will be deemed failures because they did not prevent the latest attack. In the calculus of terrorism, the last side to show its fangs becomes the victor for the moment. \"The game is tilted in Osama's favor until he's gone,\" admits a White House aide. \"That's the problem we face.\" If so, this may be a war--for now--without end.

FRD prepares studies, reports, and translations under interagency agreements for a wide variety of Federal agencies, which are listed elsewhere on this website ([http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/FAQ_Clients.html](http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/FAQ_Clients.html)). Work done for Federal agencies is the property of the requesting agency, and dissemination is controlled by them. In some cases, FRD is asked to disseminate the commissioned reports, many of which can been seen on this website under \"Research Products\" ([http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/frd/](http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/frd/)). The study \"Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism,\" reported the findings of FRD's research of then -current literature written by experts on terrorism, inside and outside government, and was commissioned in June 1999 by the National Intelligence Council ([http://www.cia.gov/nic/](http://www.cia.gov/nic/)) and delivered in September 1999.

Worden, Ph.D. Chief Federal Research Division Library of Congress 101 Independence Ave SE Washington, DC 20540-4840 E-mail: [rwor@loc.gov](mailto:rwor@loc.gov) **PREFACE** The purpose of this study is to focus attention on the types of individuals and groups that are prone to terrorism (see Glossary) in an effort to help improve U.S. counterterrorist methods and policies. The emergence of amorphous and largely unknown terrorist individuals and groups operating independently (freelancers) and the new recruitment patterns of some groups, such as recruiting suicide commandos, female and child terrorists, and scientists capable of developing weapons of mass destruction, provide a measure of urgency to increasing our understanding of the psychological and sociological dynamics of terrorist groups and individuals. The approach used in this study is twofold. First, the study examines the relevant literature and assesses the current knowledge of the subject. Second, the study seeks to develop psychological and sociological profiles of foreign terrorist individuals and selected groups to use as case studies in assessing trends, motivations, likely behavior, and actions that might deter such behavior, as well as reveal vulnerabilities that would aid in combating terrorist groups and individuals. Because this survey is concerned not only with assessing the extensive literature on sociopsychological aspects of terrorism but also providing case studies of about a dozen terrorist groups, it is limited by time constraints and data availability in the amount of attention that it can give to the individual groups, let alone individual leaders or other members. Thus, analysis of the groups and leaders will necessarily be incomplete. A longer study, for example, would allow for the collection and study of the literature produced by each group in the form of autobiographies of former members, group communiqués and manifestos, news media interviews, and other resources. Much information about the terrorist mindset (see Glossary) and decision-making process can be gleaned from such sources. Moreover, there is a language barrier to an", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:1:b5e8bef679e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8555, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "let alone individual leaders or other members. Thus, analysis of the groups and leaders will necessarily be incomplete. A longer study, for example, would allow for the collection and study of the literature produced by each group in the form of autobiographies of former members, group communiqués and manifestos, news media interviews, and other resources. Much information about the terrorist mindset (see Glossary) and decision-making process can be gleaned from such sources. Moreover, there is a language barrier to an examination of the untranslated literature of most of the groups included as case studies herein. Terrorism databases that profile groups and leaders quickly become outdated, and this report is no exception to that rule. In order to remain current, a terrorism database ideally should be updated periodically. New groups or terrorist leaders may suddenly emerge, and if an established group perpetrates a major terrorist incident, new information on the group is likely to be reported in news media. Even if a group appears to be quiescent, new information may become available about the group from scholarly publications. There are many variations in the transliteration for both Arabic and Persian. The academic versions tend to be more complex than the popular forms used in the news media and by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS). Thus, the latter usages are used in this study. For example, although Ussamah bin Ladin is the proper transliteration, the more commonly used Osama bin Laden is used in this study. **TABLE OF CONTENTS** PREFACE i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: MINDSETS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 1 New Types of Post-Cold War Terrorists 1 New Forms of Terrorist-Threat Scenarios 4 INTRODUCTION 8 TERMS OF ANALYSIS 10 Defining Terrorism and Terrorists 10 Terrorist Group Typologies 12 APPROACHES TO TERRORISM ANALYSIS 13 The Multicausal Approach 13 The Political Approach 13 The Organizational Approach 14 The Physiological Approach 15 The Psychological Approach 16 GENERAL HYPOTHESES OF TERRORISM 16 Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis 17 Negative Identity Hypothesis 17 Narcissistic Rage Hypothesis 17 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE TERRORIST 19 Terrorist Motivation 19 The Process of Joining a Terrorist Group 20 The Terrorist as Mentally Ill 23 The Terrorist as Suicidal Fanatic 27 *Fanatics* 27 *Suicide Terrorists* 28 Terrorist Group Dynamics 29 *Pressures to Conform* 31 *Pressures to Commit Acts of Violence* 32 *Terrorist Rationalization of Violence* 33 The Terrorist's Ideological or Religious Perception 35 TERRORIST PROFILING 37 Hazards of Terrorist Profiling 37 Sociological Characteristics of Terrorists in the Cold War Period 39 *A Basic Profile* 39 Age 41 Educational, Occupational, and Socioeconomic Background 41 General Traits 43 Marital Status 44 Physical Appearance 44 Origin: Rural or Urban 44 Gender 45 *Males* 45 *Females* 45 *Characteristics of Female Terrorists* 47 Practicality, Coolness 47 Dedication, Inner Strength, Ruthlessness 48 Single-Mindedness 49 *Female Motivation for Terrorism* 50 CONCLUSION 51 Terrorist Profiling 51 Terrorist Group Mindset Profiling 54 Promoting Terrorist Group Schisms 56 How Guerrilla and Terrorist Groups End 57 APPENDIX", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:2:13ba9e000abd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8556, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the Cold War Period 39 *A Basic Profile* 39 Age 41 Educational, Occupational, and Socioeconomic Background 41 General Traits 43 Marital Status 44 Physical Appearance 44 Origin: Rural or Urban 44 Gender 45 *Males* 45 *Females* 45 *Characteristics of Female Terrorists* 47 Practicality, Coolness 47 Dedication, Inner Strength, Ruthlessness 48 Single-Mindedness 49 *Female Motivation for Terrorism* 50 CONCLUSION 51 Terrorist Profiling 51 Terrorist Group Mindset Profiling 54 Promoting Terrorist Group Schisms 56 How Guerrilla and Terrorist Groups End 57 APPENDIX 61 SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES: CASE STUDIES 61 Exemplars of International Terrorism in the Early 1970s 61 *Renato Curcio* 61 *Leila Khaled* 62 *Kozo Okamoto* 64 Exemplars of International Terrorism in the Early 1990s 65 *Mahmud Abouhalima* 65 *Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman* 66 *Mohammed A.

Jenkins's premise was based on the assumption that terrorist behavior is normative, and that if they exceeded certain constraints and employed WMD they would completely alienate themselves from the public and possibly provoke swift and harsh retaliation. This assumption does seem to apply to certain secular terrorist groups. If a separatist organization such as the Provisional Irish Republic Army (PIRA) or the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (Euzkadi Ta Askatasuna--ETA), for example, were to use WMD, these groups would likely isolate their constituency and undermine sources of funding and political support. When the assumptions about terrorist groups not using WMD were made in the 1970s and 1980s, most of the terrorist groups making headlines were groups with political or nationalist-separatist agenda. Those groups, with some exceptions, such as the Japanese Red Army (JRA--Rengo Sekigun), had reason not to sabotage their ethnic bases of popular support or other domestic or foreign sympathizers of their cause by using WMD. Trends in terrorism over the past three decades, however, have contradicted the conventional thinking that terrorists are averse to using WMD. It has become increasingly evident that the assumption does not apply to religious terrorist groups or millenarian cults (see Glossary). Indeed, since at least the early 1970s analysts, including (somewhat contradictorily) Jenkins, have predicted that the first groups to employ a weapon of mass destruction would be religious sects with a millenarian, messianic, or apocalyptic mindset. When the conventional terrorist groups and individuals of the early 1970s are compared with terrorists of the early 1990s, a trend can be seen: the emergence of religious fundamentalist and new religious groups espousing the rhetoric of mass-destruction terrorism. In the 1990s, groups motivated by religious imperatives, such as Aum Shinrikyo, Hizballah, and al-Qaida, have grown and proliferated. These groups have a different attitude toward violence--one that is extranormative and seeks to maximize violence against the perceived enemy, essentially anyone who is not a fundamentalist Muslim or an Aum Shinrikyo member. Their outlook is one that divides the world simplistically into \"them\" and \"us.\" With its sarin attack on the Tokyo subway system on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:4:9d1c03f9f94a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8558, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the rhetoric of mass-destruction terrorism.

These groups have a different attitude toward violence--one that is extranormative and seeks to maximize violence against the perceived enemy, essentially anyone who is not a fundamentalist Muslim or an Aum Shinrikyo member. Their outlook is one that divides the world simplistically into \"them\" and \"us.\" With its sarin attack on the Tokyo subway system on March 20, 1995, the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo turned the prediction of terrorists using WMD into reality. Beginning in the early 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo engaged in a systematic program to develop and use WMD. It used chemical or biological WMD in about a dozen largely unreported instances in the first half of the 1990s, although they proved to be no more effective--actually less effective--than conventional weapons because of the terrorists' ineptitude. Nevertheless, it was Aum Shinrikyo's sarin attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995, that showed the world how dangerous the mindset of a religious terrorist group could be. The attack provided convincing evidence that Aum Shinrikyo probably would not hesitate to use WMD in a U.S. city, if it had an opportunity to do so. These religiously motivated groups would have no reason to take \"credit\" for such an act of mass destruction, just as Aum Shinrikyo did not take credit for its attack on the Tokyo subway, and just as Osama bin Laden did not take credit for various acts of high-casualty terrorism against U.S. targets in the 1990s. Taking credit means asking for retaliation. Instead, it is enough for these groups to simply take private satisfaction in knowing that they have dealt a harsh blow to what they perceive to be the \"Great Satan.\" Groups unlikely to be deterred by fear of public disapproval, such as Aum Shinrikyo, are the ones who seek chaos as an end in itself. The contrast between key members of religious extremist groups such as Hizballah, al-Qaida, and Aum Shinrikyo and conventional terrorists reveals some general trends relating to the personal attributes of terrorists likely to use WMD in coming years. According to psychologist Jerrold M. Post (1997), the most dangerous terrorist is likely to be the religious terrorist. Post has explained that, unlike the average political or social terrorist, who has a defined mission that is somewhat measurable in terms of media attention or government reaction, the religious terrorist can justify the most heinous acts \"in the name of Allah,\" for example. One could add, \"in the name of Aum Shinrikyo's Shoko Asahara.\" Psychologist B.J. Berkowitz (1972) describes six psychological types who would be most likely to threaten or try to use WMD: paranoids, paranoid schizophrenics, borderline mental defectives, schizophrenic types, passive-aggressive personality (see Glossary) types, and sociopath (see Glossary) personalities. He considers sociopaths the most likely actually to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:5:207fb100cd29", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8559, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "terms of media attention or government reaction, the religious terrorist can justify the most heinous acts \"in the name of Allah,\" for example.

Berkowitz (1972) describes six psychological types who would be most likely to threaten or try to use WMD: paranoids, paranoid schizophrenics, borderline mental defectives, schizophrenic types, passive-aggressive personality (see Glossary) types, and sociopath (see Glossary) personalities. He considers sociopaths the most likely actually to use WMD. Nuclear terrorism expert Jessica Stern (1999: 77) disagrees. She believes that \"Schizophrenics and sociopaths, for example, may *want* to commit acts of mass destruction, but they are less likely than others to succeed.\" She points out that large-scale dissemination of chemical, biological, or radiological agents requires a group effort, but that \"Schizophrenics, in particular, often have difficulty functioning in groups....\" Stern's understanding of the WMD terrorist appears to be much more relevant than Berkowitz's earlier stereotype of the insane terrorist. It is clear from the appended case study of Shoko Asahara that he is a paranoid. Whether he is schizophrenic or sociopathic is best left to psychologists to determine. The appended case study of Ahmed Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the World Trade Center (WTC) bombing on February 26, 1993, reported here does not suggest that he is schizophrenic or sociopathic. On the contrary, he appears to be a well-educated, highly intelligent Islamic terrorist. In 1972 Berkowitz could not have been expected to foresee that religiously motivated terrorists would be prone to using WMD as a way of emulating God or for millenarian reasons. This examination of about a dozen groups that have engaged in significant acts of terrorism suggests that the groups most likely to use WMD are indeed religious groups, whether they be wealthy cults like Aum Shinrikyo or well-funded Islamic terrorist groups like al-Qaida or Hizballah. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 fundamentally changed the operating structures of European terrorist groups. Whereas groups like the Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Faktion--RAF; see Glossary) were able to use East Germany as a refuge and a source of logistical and financial resources during the Cold War decades, terrorist groups in the post Cold War period no longer enjoy the support of communist countries. Moreover, state sponsors of international terrorism (see Glossary) toned down their support of terrorist groups. In this new environment where terrorist groups can no longer depend on state support or any significant popular support, they have been restructuring in order to learn how to operate independently. New breeds of increasingly dangerous religious terrorists emerged in the 1990s. The most dangerous type is the Islamic fundamentalist.

A case in point is Ramzi Yousef, who brought together a loosely organized, ad hoc group, the so-called Liberation Army, apparently for the sole purpose of carrying out the WTC operation on February 26, 1993. Moreover, by acting independently the small self-contained cell led by Yousef prevented authorities from linking it to an established terrorist organization, such as its suspected coordinating group,Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida, or a possible state sponsor. **The World Trade Center** *(www.GreatBuildings.com/buildings/World_Trade_Center.html*) Aum Shinrikyo is representative of the other type of religious terrorist group, in this case a cult. Shoko Asahara adopted a different approach to terrorism by modeling his organization on the structure of the Japanese government rather than an ad hoc terrorist group. Accordingly, Aum Shinrikyo \"ministers\" undertook a program to develop WMD by bringing together a core group of bright scientists skilled in the modern technologies of the computer, telecommunications equipment, information databases, and financial networks. They proved themselves capable of developing rudimentary WMD in a relatively short time and demonstrated a willingness to use them in the most lethal ways possible. Aum Shinrikyo's sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system in 1995 marked the official debut of terrorism involving WMD. Had a more lethal batch of sarin been used, or had the dissemination procedure been improved slightly, the attack might have killed thousands of people, instead of only a few. Both of these incidents--the WTC bombing and the Tokyo subway sarin attack--had similar casualty totals but could have had massive casualties. Ramzi Yousef's plot to blow up the WTC might have killed an estimated 50,000 people had his team not made a minor error in the placement of the bomb. In any case, these two acts in Manhattan and Tokyo seem an ominous foretaste of the WMD terrorism to come in the first decade of the new millennium. Increasingly, terrorist groups are recruiting members with expertise in fields such as communications, computer programming, engineering, finance, and the sciences. Ramzi Yousef graduated from Britain's Swansea University with a degree in engineering. Aum Shinrikyo's Shoko Asahara recruited a scientific team with all the expertise needed to develop WMD. Osama bin Laden also recruits highly skilled professionals in the fields of engineering, medicine, chemistry, physics, computer programming, communications, and so forth. Whereas the skills of the elite terrorist commandos of the 1960s and 1970s were often limited to what they learned in training camp, the terrorists of the 1990s who have carried out major operations have included biologists, chemists, computer specialists, engineers, and physicists. **New Forms of Terrorist-Threat Scenarios** The number of international terrorist", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:7:423962f6741f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8561, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "expertise needed to develop WMD.

The increased threat level, in the form of terrorist actions aimed at achieving a larger scale of destruction than the conventional attacks of the previous three decades of terrorism, was dramatically demonstrated with the bombing of the WTC. The WTC bombing illustrated how terrorists with technological sophistication are increasingly being recruited to carry out lethal terrorist bombing attacks. The WTC bombing may also have been a harbinger of more destructive attacks of international terrorism in the United States. Although there are not too many examples, if any, of guerrilla (see Glossary) groups dispatching commandos to carry out a terrorist operation in the United States, the mindsets of four groups discussed herein--two guerrilla/terrorist groups, a terrorist group, and a terrorist cult--are such that these groups pose particularly dangerous actual or potential terrorist threats to U.S. security interests. The two guerrilla/terrorist groups are the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) and Hizballah, the terrorist group is al-Qaida, and the terrorist cult is Aum Shinrikyo. The LTTE is not known to have engaged in anti-U.S. terrorism to date, but its suicide commandos have already assassinated a prime minister of India, a president of Sri Lanka, and a former prime minister of Sri Lanka. In August 1999, the LTTE reportedly deployed a 10-member suicide squad in Colombo to assassinate Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga and others. It cannot be safely assumed, however, that the LTTE will restrict its terrorism to the South Asian subcontinent. Prabhakaran has repeatedly warned the Western nations providing military support to Sri Lanka that they are exposing their citizens to possible attacks. The LTTE, which has an extensive international network, should not be underestimated in the terrorist threat that it could potentially pose to the United States, should it perceive this country as actively aiding the Sri Lankan government's counterinsurgency campaign. Prabhakaran is a megalomaniac whose record of ordering the assassinations of heads of state or former presidents, his meticulous planning of such actions, his compulsion to have the acts photographed and chronicled by LTTE members, and the limitless supply of female suicide commandos at his disposal add a dangerous new dimension to potential assassination threats. His highly trained and disciplined Black Tiger commandos are far more deadly than Aum Shinrikyo's inept cultists. There is little protection against the LTTE's trademark weapon: a belt-bomb suicide commando.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:8:21aebc112268", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8562, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "record of ordering the assassinations of heads of state or former presidents, his meticulous planning of such actions, his compulsion to have the acts photographed and chronicled by LTTE members, and the limitless supply of female suicide commandos at his disposal add a dangerous new dimension to potential assassination threats.

There is little protection against the LTTE's trademark weapon: a belt-bomb suicide commando. Hizballah is likewise quite dangerous. Except for its ongoing terrorist war against Israel, however, it appears to be reactive, often carrying out terrorist attacks for what it perceives to be Western military, cultural, or political threats to the establishment of an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon. The threat to U.S. interests posed by Islamic fundamentalist terrorists in particular was underscored by al-Qaida's bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. With those two devastating bombings, Osama bin Laden resurfaced as a potent terrorist threat to U.S. interests worldwide. Bin Laden is the prototype of a new breed of terrorist--the private entrepreneur who puts modern enterprise at the service of a global terrorist network. With its sarin attack against the Tokyo subway system in March 1995, Aum Shinrikyo has already used WMD, and very likely has not abandoned its quest to use such weapons to greater effect. The activities of Aum's large membership in Russia should be of particular concern because Aum Shinrikyo has used its Russian organization to try to obtain WMD, or at least WMD technologies. The leaders of any of these groups--Prabhakaran, bin Laden, and Asahara--could become paranoid, desperate, or simply vengeful enough to order their suicide devotees to employ the belt-bomb technique against the leader of the Western World. Iranian intelligence leaders could order Hizballah to attack the U.S. leadership in retaliation for some future U.S. or Israeli action, although Iran may now be distancing itself from Hizballah. Whether or not a U.S. president would be a logical target of Asahara, Prabhakaran, or bin Laden is not a particularly useful guideline to assess the probability of such an attack. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was not a logical target for the LTTE, and his assassination had very negative consequences for the LTTE. In Prabhakaran's \"psycho-logic,\" to use Post's term, he may conclude that his cause needs greater international attention, and targeting a country's top leaders is his way of getting attention. Nor does bin Laden need a logical reason, for he believes that he has a mandate from Allah to punish the \"Great Satan.\" Instead of thinking logically, Asahara thinks in terms of a megalomaniac with an apocalyptic outlook.

Aum Shinrikyo is a group whose delusional leader is genuinely paranoid about the United States and is known to have plotted to assassinate Japan's emperor. Shoko Asahara's cult is already on record for having made an assassination threat against President Clinton. If Iran's mullahs or Iraq's Saddam Hussein decide to use terrorists to attack the continental United States, they would likely turn to bin Laden's al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is among the Islamic groups recruiting increasingly skilled professionals, such as computer and communications technicians, engineers, pharmacists, and physicists, as well as Ukrainian chemists and biologists, Iraqi chemical weapons experts, and others capable of helping to develop WMD. Al-Qaida poses the most serious terrorist threat to U.S. security interests, for al-Qaida's well-trained terrorists are actively engaged in a terrorist jihad against U.S. interests worldwide. These four groups in particular are each capable of perpetrating a horrific act of terrorism in the United States, particularly on the occasion of the new millennium. Aum Shinrikyo has already threatened to use WMD in downtown Manhattan or in Washington, D.C., where it could attack the Congress, the Pentagon's Concourse, the White House, or President Clinton. The cult has threatened New York City with WMD, threatened to assassinate President Clinton, unsuccessfully attacked a U.S. naval base in Japan with biological weapons, and plotted in 1994 to attack the White House and the Pentagon with sarin and VX. If the LTTE's serial assassin of heads of state were to become angered by President Clinton, Prabhakaran could react by dispatching a Tamil \"belt-bomb girl\" to detonate a powerful semtex bomb after approaching the President in a crowd with a garland of flowers or after jumping next to his car. Al-Qaida's expected retaliation for the U.S. cruise missile attack against al-Qaida's training facilities in Afghanistan on August 20, 1998, could take several forms of terrorist attack in the nation's capital. Al-Qaida could detonate a Chechen-type building-buster bomb at a federal building. **Suicide bomber(s) belonging to al-Qaida's Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4 and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or the White House.** Ramzi Yousef had planned to do this against the CIA headquarters. In addition, both al-Qaida and Yousef were linked to a plot to assassinate President Clinton during his visit to the Philippines in early 1995. Following the August 1998 cruise missile attack, at least one Islamic religious leader called for Clinton's assassination, and another stated that \"the time is not far off\" for when the White House will be destroyed by a nuclear bomb.

A horrendous scenario consonant with al-Qaida's mindset would be its use of a nuclear suitcase bomb against any number of targets in the nation's capital. Bin Laden allegedly has already purchased a number of nuclear suitcase bombs from the Chechen Mafia. Al-Qaida's retaliation, however, is more likely to take the lower-risk form of bombing one or more U.S. airliners with time-bombs. Yousef was planning simultaneous bombings of 11 U.S. airliners prior to his capture. Whatever form an attack may take, bin Laden will most likely retaliate in a spectacular way for the cruise missile attack against his Afghan camp in August 1998. While nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer, nothing is more difficult than to understand him. - Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky **INTRODUCTION** Why do some individuals decide to break with society and embark on a career in terrorism? Do terrorists share common traits or characteristics? Is there a terrorist personality or profile? Can a terrorist profile be developed that could reliably help security personnel to identify potential terrorists, whether they be would-be airplane hijackers, assassins, or suicide bombers? Do some terrorists have a psychotic (see Glossary) personality? Psychological factors relating to terrorism are of particular interest to psychologists, political scientists, and government officials, who would like to be able to predict and prevent the emergence of terrorist groups or to thwart the realization of terrorist actions. This study focuses on individual psychological and sociological characteristics of terrorists of different generations as well as their groups in an effort to determine how the terrorist profile may have changed in recent decades, or whether they share any common sociological attributes. The assumption underlying much of the terrorist-profile research in recent decades has been that most terrorists have some common characteristics that can be determined through psychometric analysis of large quantities of biographical data on terrorists. One of the earliest attempts to single out a terrorist personality was done by Charles A. Russell and Bowman H. Miller (1977) (see Attributes of Terrorists). Ideally, a researcher attempting to profile terrorists in the 1990s would have access to extensive biographical data on several hundred terrorists arrested in various parts of the world and to data on terrorists operating in a specific country. If such data were at hand, the researcher could prepare a psychometric study analyzing attributes of the terrorist: educational, occupational, and socioeconomic background; general traits; ideology; marital status; method and place of recruitment; physical appearance; and sex.

Ideally, a researcher attempting to profile terrorists in the 1990s would have access to extensive biographical data on several hundred terrorists arrested in various parts of the world and to data on terrorists operating in a specific country. If such data were at hand, the researcher could prepare a psychometric study analyzing attributes of the terrorist: educational, occupational, and socioeconomic background; general traits; ideology; marital status; method and place of recruitment; physical appearance; and sex. Researchers have used this approach to study West German and Italian terrorist groups (see Females). Such detailed information would provide more accurate sociological profiles of terrorist groups. Although there appears to be no single terrorist personality, members of a terrorist group(s) may share numerous common sociological traits. Practically speaking, however, biographical databases on large numbers of terrorists are not readily available. Indeed, such data would be quite difficult to obtain unless one had special access to police files on terrorists around the world. Furthermore, developing an open-source biographical database on enough terrorists to have some scientific validity would require a substantial investment of time. The small number of profiles contained in this study is hardly sufficient to qualify as scientifically representative of terrorists in general, or even of a particular category of terrorists, such as religious fundamentalists or ethnic separatists. Published terrorism databases, such as Edward F. Mickolus's series of chronologies of incidents of international terrorism and the Rand-St. Andrews University Chronology of International Terrorism, are highly informative and contain some useful biographical information on terrorists involved in major incidents, but are largely incident-oriented. This study is not about terrorism per se. Rather, it is concerned with the perpetrators of terrorism. Prepared from a social sciences perspective, it attempts to synthesize the results of psychological and sociological findings of studies on terrorists published in recent decades and provide a general assessment of what is presently known about the terrorist mind and mindset. Because of time constraints and a lack of terrorism-related biographical databases, the methodology, but not the scope, of this research has necessarily been modified. In the absence of a database of terrorist biographies, this study is based on the broader database of knowledge contained in academic studies on the psychology and sociology of terrorism published over the past three decades. Using this extensive database of open-source literature available in the Library of Congress and other information drawn from Websites, such as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), this paper assesses the level of current knowledge of the subject and presents case studies that include sociopsychological profiles of about a dozen selected terrorist groups and more than two dozen terrorist leaders or other individuals implicated in acts of terrorism. Three profiles of noteworthy terrorists of the early 1970s who belonged to other groups are included in order to provide a better basis of contrast with terrorists of the late 1990s.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:12:1a2eb2df6970", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8566, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "such as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), this paper assesses the level of current knowledge of the subject and presents case studies that include sociopsychological profiles of about a dozen selected terrorist groups and more than two dozen terrorist leaders or other individuals implicated in acts of terrorism.

This paper does not presume to have any scientific validity in terms of general sampling representation of terrorists, but it does provide a preliminary theoretical, analytical, and biographical framework for further research on the general subject or on particular groups or individuals. By examining the relatively overlooked behaviorist literature on sociopsychological aspects of terrorism, this study attempts to gain psychological and sociological insights into international terrorist groups and individuals. Of particular interest is whether members of at least a dozen terrorist organizations in diverse regions of the world have any psychological or sociological characteristics in common that might be useful in profiling terrorists, if profiling is at all feasible, and in understanding somewhat better the motivations of individuals who become terrorists. Because this study includes profiles of diverse groups from Western Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, care has been taken when making cross-national, cross-cultural, and cross-ideological comparisons. This paper examines such topics as the age, economic and social background, education and occupation, gender, geographical origin, marital status, motivation, recruitment, and religion or ideology of the members of these designated groups as well as others on which relevant data are available. It is hoped that an examination of the extensive body of behaviorist literature on political and religious terrorism authored by psychologists and sociologists as well as political scientists and other social scientists will provide some answers to questions such as: Who are terrorists? How do individuals become terrorists? Do political or religious terrorists have anything in common in their sociopsychological development? How are they recruited? Is there a terrorist mindset, or are terrorist groups too diverse to have a single mindset or common psychological traits? Are there instead different terrorist mindsets? **TERMS OF ANALYSIS** **Defining Terrorism and Terrorists** Unable to achieve their unrealistic goals by conventional means, international terrorists attempt to send an ideological or religious message by terrorizing the general public. Through the choice of their targets, which are often symbolic or representative of the targeted nation, terrorists attempt to create a high-profile impact on the public of their targeted enemy or enemies with their act of violence, despite the limited material resources that are usually at their disposal. In doing so, they hope to demonstrate various points, such as that the targeted government(s) cannot protect its (their) own citizens, or that by assassinating a specific victim they can teach the general public a lesson about", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:13:f5f64a0e2abd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8567, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "targets, which are often symbolic or representative of the targeted nation, terrorists attempt to create a high-profile impact on the public of their targeted enemy or enemies with their act of violence, despite the limited material resources that are usually at their disposal.

For example, by assassinating Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on October 6, 1981, a year after his historic trip to Jerusalem, the al-Jihad terrorists hoped to convey to the world, and especially to Muslims, the error that he represented. This tactic is not new. Beginning in 48 A.D., a Jewish sect called the Zealots carried out terrorist campaigns to force insurrection against the Romans in Judea. These campaigns included the use of assassins (*sicarii*, or dagger-men), who would infiltrate Roman-controlled cities and stab Jewish collaborators or Roman legionnaires with a *sica* (dagger), kidnap members of the Staff of the Temple Guard to hold for ransom, or use poison on a large scale. The Zealots' justification for their killing of other Jews was that these killings demonstrated the consequences of the immorality of collaborating with the Roman invaders, and that the Romans could not protect their Jewish collaborators. Definitions of terrorism vary widely and are usually inadequate. Even terrorism researchers often neglect to define the term other than by citing the basic U.S. Department of State (1998) definition of terrorism as \"premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.\" Although an act of violence that is generally regarded in the United States as an act of terrorism may not be viewed so in another country, the type of violence that distinguishes terrorism from other types of violence, such as ordinary crime or a wartime military action, can still be defined in terms that might qualify as reasonably objective. This social sciences researcher defines a terrorist *action* as the calculated use of unexpected, shocking, and unlawful violence against noncombatants (including, in addition to civilians, off-duty military and security personnel in peaceful situations) and other symbolic targets perpetrated by a clandestine member(s) of a subnational group or a clandestine agent(s) for the psychological purpose of publicizing a political or religious cause and/or intimidating or coercing a government(s) or civilian population into accepting demands on behalf of the cause. In this study, the nouns \"terrorist\" or \"terrorists\" do not necessarily refer to everyone within a terrorist organization. Large organizations, such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the Irish Republic Army (IRA), or the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), have many members--for example, accountants, cooks, fund-raisers, logistics specialists, medical doctors, or recruiters--who may play only", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:14:963ad9150cd5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8568, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "of publicizing a political or religious cause and/or intimidating or coercing a government(s) or civilian population into accepting demands on behalf of the cause. In this study, the nouns \"terrorist\" or \"terrorists\" do not necessarily refer to everyone within a terrorist organization. Large organizations, such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the Irish Republic Army (IRA), or the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), have many members--for example, accountants, cooks, fund-raisers, logistics specialists, medical doctors, or recruiters--who may play only a passive support role. We are not particularly concerned here with the passive support membership of terrorist organizations. Rather, we are primarily concerned in this study with the leader(s) of terrorist groups and the activists or operators who personally carry out a group's terrorism strategy. The top leaders are of particular interest because there may be significant differences between them and terrorist activists or operatives. In contrast to the top leader(s), the individuals who carry out orders to perpetrate an act of political violence (which they would not necessarily regard as a terrorist act) have generally been recruited into the organization. Thus, their motives for joining may be different. New recruits are often isolated and alienated young people who want to join not only because they identify with the cause and idolize the group's leader, but also because they want to belong to a group for a sense of self-importance and companionship. The top leaders of several of the groups profiled in this report can be subdivided into contractors or freelancers. The distinction actually highlights an important difference between the old generation of terrorist leaders and the new breed of international terrorists. Contractors are those terrorist leaders whose services are hired by rogue states, or a particular government entity of a rogue regime, such as an intelligence agency. Notable examples of terrorist contractors include Abu Nidal, George Habash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and Abu Abbas of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF). Freelancers are terrorist leaders who are completely independent of a state, but who may collude with a rogue regime on a short-term basis. Prominent examples of freelancers include Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, Ahmed Ramzi Yousef, and Osama bin Laden. Contractors like Abu Nidal, George Habash, and Abu Abbas are representative of the old style of high-risk international terrorism. In the 1990s, rogue states, more mindful of the consequences of Western diplomatic, economic, military, and political retaliation were less inclined to risk contracting terrorist organizations. Instead, freelancers operating independently of any state carried out many of the most significant acts of terrorism in the decade. This study discusses groups that have been officially designated as terrorist groups by the U.S. Department of State. A few of the groups on the official list, however, are guerrilla organizations. These include the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK.

This study discusses groups that have been officially designated as terrorist groups by the U.S. Department of State. A few of the groups on the official list, however, are guerrilla organizations. These include the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK. To be sure, the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK engage in terrorism as well as guerrilla warfare, but categorizing them as terrorist groups and formulating policies to combat them on that basis would be simplistic and a prescription for failure. The FARC, for example, has the official status in Colombia of a political insurgent movement, as a result of a May 1999 accord between the FARC and the Colombian government. To dismiss a guerrilla group, especially one like the FARC which has been fighting for four decades, as only a terrorist group is to misunderstand its political and sociological context. It is also important to keep in mind that perceptions of what constitutes terrorism will differ from country to country, as well as among various sectors of a country's population. For example, the Nicaraguan elite regarded the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) as a terrorist group, while much of the rest of the country regarded the FSLN as freedom fighters. A foreign extremist group labeled as terrorist by the Department of State may be regarded in heroic terms by some sectors of the population in another country. Likewise, an action that would be regarded as indisputably terrorist in the United States might not be regarded as a terrorist act in another country's law courts. For example, India's Supreme Court ruled in May 1999 that the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by a LTTE \"belt-bomb girl\" was not an act of terrorism because there was no evidence that the four co-conspirators (who received the death penalty) had any desire to strike terror in the country. In addition, the Department of State's labeling of a guerrilla group as a terrorist group may be viewed by the particular group as a hostile act. For example, the LTTE has disputed, unsuccessfully, its designation on October 8, 1997, by the Department of State as a terrorist organization. By labeling the LTTE a terrorist group, the United States compromises its potential role as neutral mediator in Sri Lanka's civil war and waves a red flag at one of the world's deadliest groups, whose leader appears to be a psychopathic (see Glossary) serial killer of heads of state. To be sure, some terrorists are so committed to their cause that they freely acknowledge being terrorists.

On hearing that he had been sentenced to 240 years in prison, Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the WTC bombing, defiantly proclaimed, \"I am a terrorist, and I am proud of it.\" **Terrorist Group Typologies** This study categorizes foreign terrorist groups under one of the following four designated, somewhat arbitrary typologies: nationalist-separatist, religious fundamentalist, new religious, and social revolutionary. This group classification is based on the assumption that terrorist groups can be categorized by their political background or ideology. The social revolutionary category has also been labeled \"idealist.\" Idealistic terrorists fight for a radical cause, a religious belief, or a political ideology, including anarchism. Although some groups do not fit neatly into any one category, the general typologies are important because all terrorist campaigns are different, and the mindsets of groups within the same general category tend to have more in common than those in different categories. For example, the Irish Republic Army (IRA), Basque Fatherland and Freedom (Euzkadi Ta Askatasuna--ETA), the Palestinian terrorist groups, and the LTTE all have strong nationalistic motivations, whereas the Islamic fundamentalist and the Aum Shinrikyo groups are motivated by religious beliefs. To be at all effective, counterterrorist policies necessarily would vary depending on the typology of the group. A fifth typology, for right-wing terrorists, is not listed because right-wing terrorists were not specifically designated as being a subject of this study. In any case, there does not appear to be any significant right-wing group on the U.S. Department of State's list of foreign terrorist organizations. Right-wing terrorists are discussed only briefly in this paper (see Attributes of Terrorists). This is not to minimize the threat of right-wing extremists in the United States, who clearly pose a significant terrorist threat to U.S. security, as demonstrated by the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. **APPROACHES TO TERRORISM ANALYSIS** **The Multicausal Approach** Terrorism usually results from multiple causal factors--not only psychological but also economic, political, religious, and sociological factors, among others. There is even an hypothesis that it is caused by physiological factors, as discussed below. Because terrorism is a multicausal phenomenon, it would be simplistic and erroneous to explain an act of terrorism by a single cause, such as the psychological need of the terrorist to perpetrate an act of violence. For Paul Wilkinson (1977), the causes of revolution and political violence in general are also the causes of terrorism. These include ethnic conflicts, religious and ideological conflicts, poverty, modernization stresses, political inequities, lack of peaceful communications channels, traditions of violence, the existence of a revolutionary group, governmental weakness and ineptness, erosions of confidence in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:17:49d960b9f6ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8571, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "and erroneous to explain an act of terrorism by a single cause, such as the psychological need of the terrorist to perpetrate an act of violence. For Paul Wilkinson (1977), the causes of revolution and political violence in general are also the causes of terrorism. These include ethnic conflicts, religious and ideological conflicts, poverty, modernization stresses, political inequities, lack of peaceful communications channels, traditions of violence, the existence of a revolutionary group, governmental weakness and ineptness, erosions of confidence in a regime, and deep divisions within governing elites and leadership groups. **The Political Approach** The alternative to the hypothesis that a terrorist is born with certain personality traits that destine him or her to become a terrorist is that the root causes of terrorism can be found in influences emanating from environmental factors. Environments conducive to the rise of terrorism include international and national environments, as well as subnational ones such as universities, where many terrorists first become familiar with Marxist-Leninist ideology or other revolutionary ideas and get involved with radical groups. Russell and Miller identify universities as the major recruiting ground for terrorists. Having identified one or more of these or other environments, analysts may distinguish between precipitants that started the outbreak of violence, on the one hand, and preconditions that allowed the precipitants to instigate the action, on the other hand. Political scientists Chalmers Johnson (1978) and Martha Crenshaw (1981) have further subdivided preconditions into permissive factors, which engender a terrorist strategy and make it attractive to political dissidents, and direct situational factors, which motivate terrorists. Permissive causes include urbanization, the transportation system (for example, by allowing a terrorist to quickly escape to another country by taking a flight), communications media, weapons availability, and the absence of security measures. An example of a situational factor for Palestinians would be the loss of their homeland of Palestine. Various examples of international and national or subnational theories of terrorism can be cited. An example of an international environment hypothesis is the view proposed by Brian M. Jenkins (1979) that the failure of rural guerrilla movements in Latin America pushed the rebels into the cities. (This hypothesis, however, overlooks the national causes of Latin American terrorism and fails to explain why rural guerrilla movements continue to thrive in Colombia.) Jenkins also notes that the defeat of Arab armies in the 1967 Six-Day War caused the Palestinians to abandon hope for a conventional military solution to their problem and to turn to terrorist attacks. **The Organizational Approach** Some analysts, such as Crenshaw (1990: 250), take an organization approach to terrorism and see terrorism as a rational strategic course of action decided on by a group. In her view, terrorism is not committed by an individual. Rather, she contends that \"Acts of terrorism are committed by groups who reach collective decisions based on commonly held beliefs, although the level of individual commitment to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:18:2c2bf1bb4bb8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8572, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "conventional military solution to their problem and to turn to terrorist attacks. **The Organizational Approach** Some analysts, such as Crenshaw (1990: 250), take an organization approach to terrorism and see terrorism as a rational strategic course of action decided on by a group. In her view, terrorism is not committed by an individual. Rather, she contends that \"Acts of terrorism are committed by groups who reach collective decisions based on commonly held beliefs, although the level of individual commitment to the group and its beliefs varies.\" Crenshaw has not actually substantiated her contention with case studies that show how decisions are supposedly reached collectively in terrorist groups. That kind of inside information, to be sure, would be quite difficult to obtain without a former decision-maker within a terrorist group providing it in the form of a published autobiography or an interview, or even as a paid police informer. Crenshaw may be partly right, but her organizational approach would seem to be more relevant to guerrilla organizations that are organized along traditional Marxist-Leninist lines, with a general secretariat headed by a secretary general, than to terrorist groups per se. The FARC, for example, is a guerrilla organization, albeit one that is not averse to using terrorism as a tactic. The six members of the FARC's General Secretariat participate in its decision-making under the overall leadership of Secretary General Manuel Marulanda Vélez. The hard-line military leaders, however, often exert disproportionate influence over decision-making. Bona fide terrorist groups, like cults, are often totally dominated by a single individual leader, be it Abu Nidal, Ahmed Jibril, Osama bin Laden, or Shoko Asahara. It seems quite improbable that the terrorist groups of such dominating leaders make their decisions collectively. By most accounts, the established terrorist leaders give instructions to their lieutenants to hijack a jetliner, assassinate a particular person, bomb a U.S. Embassy, and so forth, while leaving operational details to their lieutenants to work out. The top leader may listen to his lieutenants' advice, but the top leader makes the final decision and gives the orders. **The Physiological Approach** The physiological approach to terrorism suggests that the role of the media in promoting the spread of terrorism cannot be ignored in any discussion of the causes of terrorism. Thanks to media coverage, the methods, demands, and goals of terrorists are quickly made known to potential terrorists, who may be inspired to imitate them upon becoming stimulated by media accounts of terrorist acts. The diffusion of terrorism from one place to another received scholarly attention in the early 1980s. David G. Hubbard (1983) takes a physiological approach to analyzing the causes of terrorism. He discusses three substances produced in the body under stress: norepinephrine, a compound produced by the adrenal gland and sympathetic nerve endings and associated with the \"fight or flight\" (see Glossary) physiological response of individuals in stressful situations; acetylcholine, which is produced", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:19:f616fe02306e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8573, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "becoming stimulated by media accounts of terrorist acts. The diffusion of terrorism from one place to another received scholarly attention in the early 1980s. David G. Hubbard (1983) takes a physiological approach to analyzing the causes of terrorism. He discusses three substances produced in the body under stress: norepinephrine, a compound produced by the adrenal gland and sympathetic nerve endings and associated with the \"fight or flight\" (see Glossary) physiological response of individuals in stressful situations; acetylcholine, which is produced by the parasympathetic nerve endings and acts to dampen the accelerated norepinephrine response; and endorphins, which develop in the brain as a response to stress and \"narcotize\" the brain, being 100 times more powerful than morphine. Because these substances occur in the terrorist, Hubbard concludes that much terrorist violence is rooted not in the psychology but in the physiology of the terrorist, partly the result of \"stereotyped, agitated tissue response\" to stress. Hubbard's conclusion suggests a possible explanation for the spread of terrorism, the so-called contagion effect. Kent Layne Oots and Thomas C. Wiegele (1985) have also proposed a model of terrorist contagion based on physiology. Their model demonstrates that the psychological state of the potential terrorist has important implications for the stability of society. In their analysis, because potential terrorists become aroused in a violence-accepting way by media presentations of terrorism, \"Terrorists must, by the nature of their actions, have an attitude which allows violence.\" One of these attitudes, they suspect, may be Machiavellianism because terrorists are disposed to manipulating their victims as well as the press, the public, and the authorities. They note that the potential terrorist \"need only see that terrorism has worked for others in order to become aggressively aroused.\" According to Oots and Wiegele, an individual moves from being a potential terrorist to being an actual terrorist through a process that is psychological, physiological, and political. \"If the neurophysiological model of aggression is realistic,\" Oots and Wiegele assert, \"there is no basis for the argument that terrorism could be eliminated if its sociopolitical causes were eliminated.\" They characterize the potential terrorist as \"a frustrated individual who has become aroused and has repeatedly experienced the fight or flight syndrome. Moreover, after these repeated arousals, the potential terrorist seeks relief through an aggressive act and also seeks, in part, to remove the initial cause of his frustration by achieving the political goal which he has hitherto been denied.\" D. Guttman (1979) also sees terrorist actions as being aimed more at the audience than at the immediate victims. It is, after all, the audience that may have to meet the terrorist's demands. Moreover, in Guttman's analysis, the terrorist requires a liberal rather than a right-wing audience for success. Liberals make the terrorist respectable by accepting the ideology that the terrorist alleges informs his or her acts.

Liberals make the terrorist respectable by accepting the ideology that the terrorist alleges informs his or her acts. The terrorist also requires liberal control of the media for the transmission of his or her ideology. **The Psychological Approach** In contrast with political scientists and sociologists, who are interested in the political and social contexts of terrorist groups, the relatively few psychologists who study terrorism are primarily interested in the micro-level of the individual terrorist or terrorist group. The psychological approach is concerned with the study of terrorists per se, their recruitment and induction into terrorist groups, their personalities, beliefs, attitudes, motivations, and careers as terrorists. **GENERAL HYPOTHESES OF TERRORISM** If one accepts the proposition that political terrorists are made, not born, then the question is what makes a terrorist. Although the scholarly literature on the psychology of terrorism is lacking in full-scale, quantitative studies from which to ascertain trends and develop general theories of terrorism, it does appear to focus on several theories. One, the Olson hypothesis, suggests that participants in revolutionary violence predicate their behavior on a rational cost-benefit calculus and the conclusion that violence is the best available course of action given the social conditions. The notion that a group rationally chooses a terrorism strategy is questionable, however. Indeed, a group's decision to resort to terrorism is often divisive, sometimes resulting in factionalization of the group. **Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis** The frustration-aggression hypothesis (see Glossary) of violence is prominent in the literature. This hypothesis is based mostly on the relative-deprivation hypothesis (see Glossary), as proposed by Ted Robert Gurr (1970), an expert on violent behaviors and movements, and reformulated by J.C. Davies (1973) to include a gap between rising expectations and need satisfaction. Another proponent of this hypothesis, Joseph Margolin (1977: 273-4), argues that \"much terrorist behavior is a response to the frustration of various political, economic, and personal needs or objectives.\" Other scholars, however have dismissed the frustration-aggression hypothesis as simplistic, based as it is on the erroneous assumption that aggression is always a consequence of frustration. According to Franco Ferracuti (1982), a University of Rome professor, a better approach than these and other hypotheses, including the Marxist theory, would be a subcultural theory, which takes into account that terrorists live in their own subculture, with their own value systems. Similarly, political scientist Paul Wilkinson (1974: 127) faults the frustration-aggression hypothesis for having \"very little to say about the social psychology of prejudice and hatred...\" and fanaticisms that \"play a major role in encouraging extreme violence.\" He believes that \"Political terrorism cannot be understood outside the context of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:21:4c734abaaaba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8575, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "approach than these and other hypotheses, including the Marxist theory, would be a subcultural theory, which takes into account that terrorists live in their own subculture, with their own value systems.

Knutson (1981) suggests that the political terrorist consciously assumes a negative identity. One of her examples is a Croatian terrorist who, as a member of an oppressed ethnic minority, was disappointed by the failure of his aspiration to attain a university education, and as a result assumed a negative identity by becoming a terrorist. Negative identity involves a vindictive rejection of the role regarded as desirable and proper by an individual's family and community. In Knutson's view, terrorists engage in terrorism as a result of feelings of rage and helplessness over the lack of alternatives. Her political science-oriented viewpoint seems to coincide with the frustration-aggression hypothesis. **Narcissistic Rage Hypothesis** The advocates of the narcissism-aggression hypothesis include psychologists Jerrold M. Post, John W. Crayton, and Richard M. Pearlstein. Taking the-terrorists-as-mentally-ill approach, this hypothesis concerns the early development of the terrorist. Basically, if primary narcissism in the form of the \"grandiose self\" is not neutralized by reality testing, the grandiose self produces individuals who are sociopathic, arrogant, and lacking in regard for others. Similarly, if the psychological form of the \"idealized parental ego\" is not neutralized by reality testing, it can produce a condition of helpless defeatism, and narcissistic defeat can lead to reactions of rage and a wish to destroy the source of narcissistic injury. \"As a specific manifestation of narcissistic rage, terrorism occurs in the context of narcissistic injury,\" writes Crayton (1983:37-8). For Crayton, terrorism is an attempt to acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation. He suggests that the \"meaningful high ideals\" of the political terrorist group \"protect the group members from experiencing shame.\" In Post's view, a particularly striking personality trait of people who are drawn to terrorism \"is the reliance placed on the psychological mechanisms of \"externalization\" and 'splitting'.\" These are psychological mechanisms, he explains, that are found in \"individuals with narcissistic and borderline personality disturbances.\" \"Splitting,\" he explains, is a mechanism characteristic of people whose personality development is shaped by a particular type of psychological damage (narcissistic injury) during childhood. Those individuals with a damaged self-concept have failed to integrate the good and bad parts of the self, which are instead split into the \"me\" and the \"not me.\" These individuals, who have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:22:80372f75f5eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8576, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "mechanisms of \"externalization\" and 'splitting'.\" These are psychological mechanisms, he explains, that are found in \"individuals with narcissistic and borderline personality disturbances.\" \"Splitting,\" he explains, is a mechanism characteristic of people whose personality development is shaped by a particular type of psychological damage (narcissistic injury) during childhood. Those individuals with a damaged self-concept have failed to integrate the good and bad parts of the self, which are instead split into the \"me\" and the \"not me.\" These individuals, who have included Hitler, need an outside enemy to blame for their own inadequacies and weaknesses. The data examined by Post, including a 1982 West German study, indicate that many terrorists have not been successful in their personal, educational, and vocational lives. Thus, they are drawn to terrorist groups, which have an us-versus-them outlook. This hypothesis, however, appears to be contradicted by the increasing number of terrorists who are well-educated professionals, such as chemists, engineers, and physicists. The psychology of the self is clearly very important in understanding and dealing with terrorist behavior, as in incidents of hostage-barricade terrorism (see Glossary). Crayton points out that humiliating the terrorists in such situations by withholding food, for example, would be counterproductive because \"the very basis for their activity stems from their sense of low self-esteem and humiliation.\" Using a Freudian analysis of the self and the narcissistic personality, Pearlstein (1991) eruditely applies the psychological concept of narcissism to terrorists. He observes that the political terrorist circumvents the psychopolitical liabilities of accepting himself or herself as a terrorist with a negative identity through a process of rhetorical self-justification that is reinforced by the group's group-think. His hypothesis, however, seems too speculative a construct to be used to analyze terrorist motivation independently of numerous other factors. For example, politically motivated hijackers have rarely acted for self-centered reasons, but rather in the name of the political goals of their groups. It also seems questionable that terrorist suicide-bombers, who deliberately sacrificed themselves in the act, had a narcissistic personality. **THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE TERRORIST** **Terrorist Motivation** In addition to drawing on political science and sociology, this study draws on the discipline of psychology, in an attempt to explain terrorist motivation and to answer questions such as who become terrorists and what kind of individuals join terrorist groups and commit public acts of shocking violence. Although there have been numerous attempts to explain terrorism from a psychiatric or psychological perspective, Wilkinson notes that the psychology and beliefs of terrorists have been inadequately explored. Most psychological analyses of terrorists and terrorism, according to psychologist Maxwell Taylor (1988), have attempted to address what motivates terrorists or to describe personal characteristics of terrorists, on the assumption that terrorists can be identified by these attributes. However, although an understanding of the terrorist mindset would be the key to understanding how and why an individual becomes a terrorist, numerous psychologists have been unable to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:23:0fc858e739f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8577, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "perspective, Wilkinson notes that the psychology and beliefs of terrorists have been inadequately explored. Most psychological analyses of terrorists and terrorism, according to psychologist Maxwell Taylor (1988), have attempted to address what motivates terrorists or to describe personal characteristics of terrorists, on the assumption that terrorists can be identified by these attributes. However, although an understanding of the terrorist mindset would be the key to understanding how and why an individual becomes a terrorist, numerous psychologists have been unable to adequately define it. Indeed, there appears to be a general agreement among psychologists who have studied the subject that there is no one terrorist mindset. This view, however, itself needs to be clarified. The topic of the terrorist mindset was discussed at a Rand conference on terrorism coordinated by Brian M. Jenkins in September 1980. The observations made about terrorist mindsets at that conference considered individuals, groups, and individuals as part of a group. The discussion revealed how little was known about the nature of terrorist mindsets, their causes and consequences, and their significance for recruitment, ideology, leader-follower relations, organization, decision making about targets and tactics, escalation of violence, and attempts made by disillusioned terrorists to exit from the terrorist group. Although the current study has examined these aspects of the terrorist mindset, it has done so within the framework of a more general tasking requirement. Additional research and analysis would be needed to focus more closely on the concept of the terrorist mindset and to develop it into a more useful method for profiling terrorist groups and leaders on a more systematic and accurate basis. Within this field of psychology, the personality dynamics of individual terrorists, including the causes and motivations behind the decision to join a terrorist group and to commit violent acts, have also received attention. Other small-group dynamics that have been of particular interest to researchers include the terrorists' decision-making patterns, problems of leadership and authority, target selection, and group mindset as a pressure tool on the individual. Attempts to explain terrorism in purely psychological terms ignore the very real economic, political, and social factors that have always motivated radical activists, as well as the possibility that biological or physiological variables may play a role in bringing an individual to the point of perpetrating terrorism. Although this study provides some interdisciplinary context to the study of terrorists and terrorism, it is concerned primarily with the sociopsychological approach. Knutson (1984), Executive Director of the International Society of Political Psychology until her death in 1982, carried out an extensive international research project on the psychology of political terrorism. The basic premise of terrorists whom she evaluated in depth was \"that their violent acts stem from feelings of rage and hopelessness engendered by the belief that society permits no other access to information-dissemination and policy-formation processes.\" The social psychology of political terrorism has received extensive analysis in studies of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:24:cbbefa48044a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8578, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "approach.

The basic premise of terrorists whom she evaluated in depth was \"that their violent acts stem from feelings of rage and hopelessness engendered by the belief that society permits no other access to information-dissemination and policy-formation processes.\" The social psychology of political terrorism has received extensive analysis in studies of terrorism, but the individual psychology of political and religious terrorism has been largely ignored. Relatively little is known about the terrorist as an individual, and the psychology of terrorists remains poorly understood, despite the fact that there have been a number of individual biographical accounts, as well as sweeping sociopolitical or psychiatric generalizations. A lack of data and an apparent ambivalence among many academic researchers about the academic value of terrorism research have contributed to the relatively little systematic social and psychological research on terrorism. This is unfortunate because psychology, concerned as it is with behavior and the factors that influence and control behavior, can provide practical as opposed to conceptual knowledge of terrorists and terrorism. A principal reason for the lack of psychometric studies of terrorism is that researchers have little, if any, direct access to terrorists, even imprisoned ones. Occasionally, a researcher has gained special access to a terrorist group, but usually at the cost of compromising the credibility of her/her research. Even if a researcher obtains permission to interview an incarcerated terrorist, such an interview would be of limited value and reliability for the purpose of making generalizations. Most terrorists, including imprisoned ones, would be loath to reveal their group's operational secrets to their interrogators, let alone to journalists or academic researchers, whom the terrorists are likely to view as representatives of the \"system\" or perhaps even as intelligence agents in disguise. Even if terrorists agree to be interviewed in such circumstances, they may be less than candid in answering questions. For example, most imprisoned Red Army Faction members reportedly declined to be interviewed by West German social scientists. Few researchers or former terrorists write exposés of terrorist groups. Those who do could face retaliation. For example, the LTTE shot to death an anti-LTTE activist, Sabaratnam Sabalingam, in Paris on May 1, 1994, to prevent him from publishing an anti-LTTE book. The LTTE also murdered Dr. Rajani Thiranagama, a Tamil, and one of the four Sri Lankan authors of *The Broken Palmyrah*, which sought to examine the \"martyr\" cult. **The Process of Joining a Terrorist Group** Individuals who become terrorists often are unemployed, socially alienated individuals who have dropped out of society.

Those with little education, such as youths in Algerian ghettos or the Gaza Strip, may try to join a terrorist group out of boredom and a desire to have an action-packed adventure in pursuit of a cause they regard as just. Some individuals may be motivated mainly by a desire to use their special skills, such as bomb-making. The more educated youths may be motivated more by genuine political or religious convictions. The person who becomes a terrorist in Western countries is generally both intellectual and idealistic. Usually, these disenchanted youths, both educated or uneducated, engage in occasional protest and dissidence. Potential terrorist group members often start out as sympathizers of the group. Recruits often come from support organizations, such as prisoner support groups or student activist groups. From sympathizer, one moves to passive supporter. Often, violent encounters with police or other security forces motivate an already socially alienated individual to join a terrorist group. Although the circumstances vary, the end result of this gradual process is that the individual, often with the help of a family member or friend with terrorist contacts, turns to terrorism. Membership in a terrorist group, however, is highly selective. Over a period as long as a year or more, a recruit generally moves in a slow, gradual fashion toward full membership in a terrorist group. An individual who drops out of society can just as well become a monk or a hermit instead of a terrorist. For an individual to choose to become a terrorist, he or she would have to be motivated to do so. Having the proper motivation, however, is still not enough. The would-be terrorist would need to have the opportunity to join a terrorist group. And like most job seekers, he or she would have to be acceptable to the terrorist group, which is a highly exclusive group. Thus, recruits would not only need to have a personality that would allow them to fit into the group, but ideally a certain skill needed by the group, such as weapons or communications skills. The psychology of joining a terrorist group differs depending on the typology of the group. Someone joining an anarchistic or a Marxist-Leninist terrorist group would not likely be able to count on any social support, only social opprobrium, whereas someone joining an ethnic separatist group like ETA or the IRA would enjoy considerable social support and even respect within ethnic enclaves. Psychologist Eric D. Shaw (1986:365) provides a strong case for what he calls \"The Personal Pathway Model,\" by which terrorists enter their new profession.

Psychologist Eric D. Shaw (1986:365) provides a strong case for what he calls \"The Personal Pathway Model,\" by which terrorists enter their new profession. The components of this pathway include early socialization processes; narcissistic injuries; escalatory events, particularly confrontation with police; and personal connections to terrorist group members, as follows: The personal pathway model suggests that terrorists came from a selected, at risk population, who have suffered from early damage to their self-esteem. Their subsequent political activities may be consistent with the liberal social philosophies of their families, but go beyond their perception of the contradiction in their family's beliefs and lack of social action. Family political philosophies may also serve to sensitize these persons to the economic and political tensions inherent throughout modern society. As a group, they appear to have been unsuccessful in obtaining a desired traditional place in society, which has contributed to their frustration. The underlying need to belong to a terrorist group is symptomatic of an incomplete or fragmented psychosocial identity. (In Kohut's terms--a defective or fragmented \"group self\"). Interestingly, the acts of security forces or police are cited as provoking more violent political activity by these individuals and it is often a personal connection to other terrorists which leads to membership in a violent group (shared external targets?). Increasingly, terrorist organizations in the developing world are recruiting younger members. The only role models for these young people to identify with are often terrorists and guerrillas. Abu Nidal, for example, was able to recruit alienated, poor, and uneducated youths thrilled to be able to identify themselves with a group led by a well-known but mysterious figure. During the 1980s and early 1990s, thousands of foreign Muslim volunteers (14,000, according to *Jane's Intelligence Review*)--angry, young, and zealous and from many countries, including the United States--flocked to training camps in Afghanistan or the Pakistan-Afghan border region to learn the art of combat. They ranged in age from 17 to 35. Some had university educations, but most were uneducated, unemployed youths without any prospects. Deborah M. Galvin (1983) notes that a common route of entry into terrorism for female terrorists is through political involvement and belief in a political cause. The Intifada (see Glossary), for example, radicalized many young Palestinians, who later joined terrorist organizations. At least half of the Intifada protesters were young girls. Some women are recruited into terrorist organizations by boyfriends.

Some women are recruited into terrorist organizations by boyfriends. A significant feature that Galvin feels may characterize the involvement of the female terrorist is the \"male or female lover/female accomplice ... scenario.\" The lover, a member of the terrorist group, recruits the female into the group. One ETA female member, \"Begona,\" told Eileen MacDonald (1992) that was how she joined at age 25: \"I got involved [in ETA] because a man I knew was a member.\" A woman who is recruited into a terrorist organization on the basis of her qualifications and motivation is likely to be treated more professionally by her comrades than one who is perceived as lacking in this regard. Two of the PFLP hijackers of Sabena Flight 517 from Brussels to Tel Aviv on May 8, 1972, Therese Halsa, 19, and Rima Tannous, 21, had completely different characters. Therese, the daughter of a middle-class Arab family, was a nursing student when she was recruited into Fatah by a fellow student and was well regarded in the organization. Rima, an orphan of average intelligence, became the mistress of a doctor who introduced her to drugs and recruited her into Fatah. She became totally dependent on some Fatah members, who subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. Various terrorist groups recruit both female and male members from organizations that are lawful. For example, ETA personnel may be members of Egizan (\"Act Woman!\"), a feminist movement affiliated with ETA's political wing; the Henri Batasuna (Popular Unity) party; or an amnesty group seeking release for ETA members. While working with the amnesty group, a number of women reportedly tended to become frustrated over mistreatment of prisoners and concluded that the only solution was to strike back, which they did by joining the ETA. \"Women seemed to become far more emotionally involved than men with the suffering of prisoners,\" an ETA member, \"Txikia,\" who joined at age 20, told MacDonald, \"and when they made the transition from supporter to guerrilla, appeared to carry their deeper sense of commitment with them into battle.\" **The Terrorist as Mentally Ill** A common stereotype is that someone who commits such abhorrent acts as planting a bomb on an airliner, detonating a vehicle bomb on a city street, or tossing a grenade into a crowded sidewalk café is abnormal. The psychopathological (see Glossary) orientation has dominated the psychological approach to the terrorist's personality. As noted by Taylor, two basic psychological approaches to understanding terrorists have been commonly used: the terrorist is viewed either as mentally ill or as a fanatic. For Walter Laqueur (1977:125), \"Terrorists are fanatics and fanaticism frequently makes for cruelty and sadism.\" This study is not concerned with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:28:50fe3f61831a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8582, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "a vehicle bomb on a city street, or tossing a grenade into a crowded sidewalk café is abnormal.

For Walter Laqueur (1977:125), \"Terrorists are fanatics and fanaticism frequently makes for cruelty and sadism.\" This study is not concerned with the lone terrorist, such as the Unabomber in the United States, who did not belong to any terrorist group. Criminologist Franco Ferracuti has noted that there is \"no such thing as an isolated terrorist--that's a mental case.\" Mentally unbalanced individuals have been especially attracted to airplane hijacking. David G. Hubbard (1971) conducted a psychiatric study of airplane hijackers in 1971 and concluded that skyjacking is used by psychiatrically ill patients as an expression of illness. His study revealed that skyjackers shared several common traits: a violent father, often an alcoholic; a deeply religious mother, often a religious zealot; a sexually shy, timid, and passive personality; younger sisters toward whom the skyjackers acted protectively; and poor achievement, financial failure, and limited earning potential. Those traits, however, are shared by many people who do not hijack airplanes. Thus, profiles of mentally unstable hijackers would seem to be of little, if any, use in detecting a potential hijacker in advance. A useful profile would probably have to identify physical or behavioral traits that might alert authorities to a potential terrorist before a suspect is allowed to board an aircraft, that is, if hijackers have identifiable personality qualities. In the meantime, weapons detection, passenger identification, and onboard security guards may be the only preventive measures. Even then, an individual wanting to hijack an airplane can often find a way. Japan's Haneda Airport screening procedures failed to detect a large knife that a 28-year-old man carried aboard an All Nippon Airways jumbo jet on July 23, 1999, and used to stab the pilot (who died) and take the plane's controls until overpowered by others. Although police have suggested that the man may have psychiatric problems, the fact that he attempted to divert the plane to the U.S. Yokota Air Base north of Tokyo, at a time when the airbase was a subject of controversy because the newly elected governor of Tokyo had demanded its closure, suggests that he may have had a political or religious motive. There have been cases of certifiably mentally ill terrorists. Klaus Jnschke, a mental patient, was one of the most ardent members of the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK), a German terrorist group working with the Baader-Meinhof Gang (see Glossary). In some instances, political terrorists have clearly exhibited psychopathy (see Glossary). For example, in April 1986 Nezar Hindawi, a freelance Syrian-funded Jordanian terrorist and would-be agent of Syrian intelligence, sent his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:29:9636839dab64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8583, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "suggests that he may have had a political or religious motive.

In some instances, political terrorists have clearly exhibited psychopathy (see Glossary). For example, in April 1986 Nezar Hindawi, a freelance Syrian-funded Jordanian terrorist and would-be agent of Syrian intelligence, sent his pregnant Irish girlfriend on an El Al flight to Israel, promising to meet her there to be married. Unknown to her, however, Hindawi had hidden a bomb (provided by the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)) in a false bottom to her hand luggage. His attempt to bomb the airliner in midair by duping his pregnant girlfriend was thwarted when the bomb was discovered by Heathrow security personnel. Taylor regards Hindawi's behavior in this incident as psychopathic because of Hindawi's willingness to sacrifice his fiancé and unborn child. Jerrold Post (1990), a leading advocate of the terrorists-as-mentally ill approach, has his own psychological hypothesis of terrorism. Although he does not take issue with the proposition that terrorists reason logically, Post argues that terrorists' reasoning process is characterized by what he terms \"terrorist psycho-logic.\" In his analysis, terrorists do not willingly resort to terrorism as an intentional choice. Rather, he argues that \"political terrorists are driven to commit acts of violence as a consequence of psychological forces, and that their special psycho-logic is constructed to rationalize acts they are psychologically compelled to commit\"(1990:25). Post's hypothesis that terrorists are motivated by psychological forces is not convincing and seems to ignore the numerous factors that motivate terrorists, including their ideological convictions. Post (1997) believes that the most potent form of terrorism stems from those individuals who are bred to hate, from generation to generation, as in Northern Ireland and the Basque country. For these terrorists, in his view, rehabilitation in nearly impossible because ethnic animosity or hatred is \"in their blood\" and passed from father to son. Post also draws an interesting distinction between \"anarchic-ideologues\"such as the Italian Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse) and the German RAF (aka the Baader-Meinhof Gang), and the \"nationalist-separatist\" groups such as the ETA, or the IRA, stating that: There would seem to be a profound difference between terrorists bent on destroying their own society, the \"world of their fathers,\" and those whose terrorist activities carry on the mission of their fathers. To put it in other words, for some, becoming terrorists is an act of retaliation for real and imagined hurts *against the society of their parents*; for others, it is an act of retaliation against society *for the hurt done to their parents*.... This would suggest more conflict, more psychopathology, among those committed to anarchy and destruction of society....

This would suggest more conflict, more psychopathology, among those committed to anarchy and destruction of society.... (1984:243) Indeed, author Julian Becker (1984) describes the German terrorists of the Baader-Meinhof Gang as \"children without fathers.\" They were sons and daughters of fathers who had either been killed by Nazis or survived Nazism. Their children despised and rebelled against them because of the shame of Nazism and a defeated Germany. One former RAF female member told MacDonald: \"We hated our parents because they were former Nazis, who had never come clean about their past.\" Similarly, Gunther Wagenlehner (1978:201) concludes that the motives of RAF terrorists were unpolitical and belonged \"more to the area of psychopathological disturbances.\" Wagenlehner found that German terrorists blamed the government for failing to solve their personal problems. Not only was becoming a terrorist \"an individual form of liberation\" for radical young people with personal problems, but \"These students became terrorists because they suffered from acute fear and from aggression and the masochistic desire to be pursued.\" In short, according to Wagenlehner, the West German anarchists stand out as a major exception to the generally nonpathological characteristics of most terrorists. Psychologist Konrad Kellen (1990:43) arrives at a similar conclusion, noting that most of the West German terrorists \"suffer from a deep psychological trauma\" that \"makes them see the world, including their own actions and the expected effects of those actions, in a grossly unrealistic light\" and that motivates them to kill people. Sociologist J. Bowyer Bell (1985) also has noted that European anarchists, unlike other terrorists, belong more to the \"province of psychologists than political analysts....\" Post's distinction between anarchic-ideologues and ethnic separatists appears to be supported by Rona M. Fields's (1978) psychometric assessment of children in Northern Ireland. Fields found that exposure to terrorism as a child can lead to a proclivity for terrorism as an adult. Thus, a child growing up in violence-plagued West Belfast is more likely to develop into a terrorist as an adult than is a child growing up in peaceful Oslo, Norway, for example. Maxwell Taylor, noting correctly that there are numerous other factors in the development of a terrorist, faults Fields's conclusions for, among other things, a lack of validation with adults. Maxwell Taylor overlooks, however, that Field's study was conducted over an eight-year period. Taylor's point is that Field's conclusions do not take into account that relatively very few children exposed to violence, even in Northern Ireland, grow up to become terrorists. A number of other psychologists would take issue with another of Post's contentions--that the West", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:31:878e027b1248", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8585, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "there are numerous other factors in the development of a terrorist, faults Fields's conclusions for, among other things, a lack of validation with adults.

Taylor's point is that Field's conclusions do not take into account that relatively very few children exposed to violence, even in Northern Ireland, grow up to become terrorists. A number of other psychologists would take issue with another of Post's contentions--that the West German anarchists were more pathological than Irish terrorists. For example, psychiatrist W. Rasch (1979), who interviewed a number of West German terrorists, determined that \"no conclusive evidence has been found for the assumption that a significant number of them are disturbed or abnormal.\" For Rasch the argument that terrorism is pathological behavior only serves to minimize the political or social issues that motivated the terrorists into action. And psychologist Ken Heskin (1984), who has studied the psychology of terrorism in Northern Ireland, notes that \"In fact, there is no psychological evidence that terrorists are diagnosably psychopathic or otherwise clinically disturbed.\" Although there may have been instances in which a mentally ill individual led a terrorist group, this has generally not been the case in international terrorism. Some specialists point out, in fact, that there is little reliable evidence to support the notion that terrorists in general are psychologically disturbed individuals. The careful, detailed planning and well-timed execution that have characterized many terrorist operations are hardly typical of mentally disturbed individuals. There is considerable evidence, on the contrary, that international terrorists are generally quite sane. Crenshaw (1981) has concluded from her studies that \"the outstanding common characteristic of terrorists is their normality.\" This view is shared by a number of psychologists. For example, C.R. McCauley and M.E. Segal (1987) conclude in a review of the social psychology of terrorist groups that \"the best documented generalization is negative; terrorists do not show any striking psychopathology.\" Heskin (1984) did not find members of the IRA to be emotionally disturbed. It seems clear that terrorists are extremely alienated from society, but alienation does not necessarily mean being mentally ill. Maxwell Taylor (1984) found that the notion of mental illness has little utility with respect to most terrorist actions. Placing the terrorist within the ranks of the mentally ill, he points out, makes assumptions about terrorist motivations and places terrorist behavior outside the realms of both the normal rules of behavior and the normal process of law. He points out several differences that separate the psychopath from the political terrorist, although the two may not be mutually exclusive, as in the case of Hindawi. One difference is the psychopath's inability to profit from experience. Another important difference is that, in contrast to the terrorist, the purposefulness, if any, of a psychopath's actions is personal. In addition, psychopaths are too unreliable and incapable of being controlled", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:32:7b5de3e46ed7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8586, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "both the normal rules of behavior and the normal process of law.

One difference is the psychopath's inability to profit from experience. Another important difference is that, in contrast to the terrorist, the purposefulness, if any, of a psychopath's actions is personal. In addition, psychopaths are too unreliable and incapable of being controlled to be of use to terrorist groups. Taylor notes that terrorist groups need discreet activists who do not draw attention to themselves and who can merge back into the crowd after executing an operation. For these reasons, he believes that \"it may be inappropriate to think of the terrorist as mentally ill in conventional terms\" (1994:92). Taylor and Ethel Quayle (1994:197) conclude that \"the active terrorist is not discernibly different in psychological terms from the non-terrorist.\" In other words, terrorists are recruited from a population that describes most of us. Taylor and Quayle also assert that \"in psychological terms, there are no special qualities that characterize the terrorist.\" Just as there is no necessary reason why people sharing the same career in normal life necessarily have psychological characteristics in common, the fact that terrorists have the same career does not necessarily mean that they have anything in common psychologically. The selectivity with which terrorist groups recruit new members helps to explain why so few pathologically ill individuals are found within their ranks. Candidates who appear to be potentially dangerous to the terrorist group's survival are screened out. Candidates with unpredictable or uncontrolled behavior lack the personal attributes that the terrorist recruiter is looking for. Many observers have noted that the personality of the terrorist has a depressive aspect to it, as reflected in the terrorist's death-seeking or death-confronting behavior. The terrorist has often been described by psychologists as incapable of enjoying anything (anhedonic) or forming meaningful interpersonal relationships on a reciprocal level. According to psychologist Risto Fried, the terrorist's interpersonal world is characterized by three categories of people: the terrorist's idealized heroes; the terrorist's enemies; and people one encounters in everyday life, whom the terrorist regards as shadow figures of no consequence. However, Fried (1982:123) notes that some psychologists with extensive experience with some of the most dangerous terrorists \"emphasize that the terrorist may be perfectly normal from a clinical point of view, that he may have a psychopathology of a different order, or that his personality may be only a minor factor in his becoming a terrorist if he was recruited into a terrorist group rather than having volunteered for one.\" **The Terrorist as Suicidal Fanatic** ***Fanatics*** The other of the two approaches that have predominated, the terrorist as fanatic, emphasizes the terrorist's rational qualities and views the terrorist as a cool, logical planning individual whose rewards are ideological", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:33:149a54a3ef9d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8587, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "point of view, that he may have a psychopathology of a different order, or that his personality may be only a minor factor in his becoming a terrorist if he was recruited into a terrorist group rather than having volunteered for one.\" **The Terrorist as Suicidal Fanatic** ***Fanatics*** The other of the two approaches that have predominated, the terrorist as fanatic, emphasizes the terrorist's rational qualities and views the terrorist as a cool, logical planning individual whose rewards are ideological and political, rather than financial. This approach takes into account that terrorists are often well educated and capable of sophisticated, albeit highly biased, rhetoric and political analysis. Notwithstanding the religious origins of the word, the term \"fanaticism\" in modern usage, has broadened out of the religious context to refer to more generally held extreme beliefs. The terrorist is often labeled as a fanatic, especially in actions that lead to self-destruction. Although fanaticism is not unique to terrorism, it is, like \"terrorism,\" a pejorative term. In psychological terms, the concept of fanaticism carries some implications of mental illness, but, Taylor (1988:97) points out, it \"is not a diagnostic category in mental illness.\" Thus, he believes that \"Commonly held assumptions about the relationship between fanaticism and mental illness...seem to be inappropriate.\" The fanatic often seems to view the world from a particular perspective lying at the extreme of a continuum. Two related processes, Taylor points out, are prejudice and authoritarianism, with which fanaticism has a number of cognitive processes in common, such as an unwillingness to compromise, a disdain for other alternative views, the tendency to see things in black-and-white, a rigidity of belief, and a perception of the world that reflects a closed mind. Understanding the nature of fanaticism, he explains, requires recognizing the role of the cultural (religious and social) context. Fanaticism, in Taylor's view, may indeed \"...be part of the cluster of attributes of the terrorist.\" However, Taylor emphasizes that the particular cultural context in which the terrorist is operating needs to be taken into account in understanding whether the term might be appropriate. ***Suicide Terrorists*** Deliberate self-destruction, when the terrorist's death is necessary in order to detonate a bomb or avoid capture, is not a common feature of terrorism in most countries, although it happens occasionally with Islamic fundamentalist terrorists in the Middle East and Tamil terrorists in Sri Lanka and southern India. It is also a feature of North Korean terrorism. The two North Korean agents who blew up Korean Air Flight 858 on November 28, 1987, popped cyanide capsules when confronted by police investigators. Only one of the terrorists succeeded in killing himself, however. Prior to mid-1985, there were 11 suicide attacks against international targets in the Middle East using vehicle bombs.

The first instance, however, was the bombing of Israel's military headquarters in Tyre, in which 141 people were killed. Inspired by these suicide attacks in Lebanon and his closer ties with Iran and Hizballah, Abu Nidal launched \"suicide squads\" in his attacks against the Rome and Vienna airports in late December 1985, in which an escape route was not planned. The world leaders in terrorist suicide attacks are not the Islamic fundamentalists, but the Tamils of Sri Lanka. The LTTE's track record for suicide attacks is unrivaled. Its suicide commandos have blown up the prime ministers of two countries (India and Sri Lanka), celebrities, at least one naval battleship, and have regularly used suicide to avoid capture as well as simply a means of protest. LTTE terrorists do not dare not to carry out their irrevocable orders to use their cyanide capsules if captured. No fewer than 35 LTTE operatives committed suicide to simply avoid being questioned by investigators in the wake of the Gandhi assassination. Attempting to be circumspect, investigators disguised themselves as doctors in order to question LTTE patients undergoing medical treatment, but, Vijay Karan (1997:46) writes about the LTTE patients, \"Their reflexes indoctrinated to react even to the slightest suspicion, all of them instantly popped cyanide capsules.\" Two were saved only because the investigators forcibly removed the capsules from their mouths, but one investigator suffered a severe bite wound on his hand and had to be hospitalized for some time. To Western observers, the acts of suicide terrorism by adherents of Islam and Hinduism may be attributable to fanaticism or mental illness or both. From the perspective of the Islamic movement, however, such acts of self-destruction have a cultural and religious context, the historical origins of which can be seen in the behavior of religious sects associated with the Shi'ite movement, notably the Assassins (see Glossary). Similarly, the suicide campaign of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the 1993-94 period involved young Palestinian terrorists, who, acting on individual initiative, attacked Israelis in crowded places, using home-made improvised weapons such as knives and axes. Such attacks were suicidal because escape was not part of the attacker's plan. These attacks were, at least in part, motivated by revenge.

Such attacks were suicidal because escape was not part of the attacker's plan. These attacks were, at least in part, motivated by revenge. According to scholars of Muslim culture, so-called suicide bombings, however, are seen by Islamists and Tamils alike as instances of martyrdom, and should be understood as such. The Arabic term used is *istishad*, a religious term meaning to give one's life in the name of Allah, as opposed to *intihar*, which refers to suicide resulting from personal distress. The latter form of suicide is not condoned in Islamic teachings. There is a clear correlation between suicide attacks and concurrent events and developments in the Middle Eastern area. For example, suicide attacks increased in frequency after the October 1990 clashes between Israeli security forces and Muslim worshipers on Temple Mount, in the Old City of Jerusalem, in which 18 Muslims were killed. The suicide attacks carried out by Hamas in Afula and Hadera in April 1994 coincided with the talks that preceded the signing by Israel and the PLO of the Cairo agreement. They were also claimed to revenge the massacre of 39 and the wounding of 200 Muslim worshipers in a Hebron mosque by an Israeli settler on February 25, 1994. Attacks perpetrated in Ramat-Gan and in Jerusalem in July and August 1995, respectively, coincided with the discussions concerning the conduct of elections in the Territories, which were concluded in the Oslo II agreement. The primary reason for Hamas's suicide attacks was that they exacted a heavy price in Israeli casualties. Most of the suicide attackers came from the Gaza Strip. Most were bachelors aged 18 to 25, with high school education, and some with university education. Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives sent the attackers on their missions believing they would enter eternal Paradise. **Terrorist Group Dynamics** Unable to study terrorist group dynamics first-hand, social scientists have applied their understanding of small-group behavior to terrorist groups. Some features of terrorist groups, such as pressures toward conformity and consensus, are characteristic of all small groups. For whatever reason individuals assume the role of terrorists, their transformation into terrorists with a political or religious agenda takes places within the structure of the terrorist group. This group provides a sense of belonging, a feeling of self-importance, and a new belief system that defines the terrorist act as morally acceptable and the group's goals as of paramount importance. As Shaw (1988:366) explains: Apparently membership in a terrorist group often provides a solution to the pressing personal needs of which the inability to achieve a desired niche in traditional society", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:36:0d96c7ae7bb9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8590, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "into terrorists with a political or religious agenda takes places within the structure of the terrorist group.

As Shaw (1988:366) explains: Apparently membership in a terrorist group often provides a solution to the pressing personal needs of which the inability to achieve a desired niche in traditional society is the coup de grace. The terrorist identity offers the individual a role in society, albeit a negative one, which is commensurate with his or her prior expectations and sufficient to compensate for past losses. Group membership provides a sense of potency, an intense and close interpersonal environment, social status, potential access to wealth and a share in what may be a grandiose but noble social design. The powerful psychological forces of conversion in the group are sufficient to offset traditional social sanctions against violence....To the terrorists their acts may have the moral status of religious warfare or political liberation. Terrorist groups are similar to religious sects or cults. They require total commitment by members; they often prohibit relations with outsiders, although this may not be the case with ethnic or separatist terrorist groups whose members are well integrated into the community; they regulate and sometimes ban sexual relations; they impose conformity; they seek cohesiveness through interdependence and mutual trust; and they attempt to brainwash individual members with their particular ideology. According to Harry C. Holloway, M.D., and Ann E. Norwood, M.D. (1997:417), the joining process for taking on the beliefs, codes, and cult of the terrorist group \"involves an interaction between the psychological structure of the terrorist's personality and the ideological factors, group process, structural organization of the terrorist group and cell, and the sociocultural milieu of the group.\" Citing Knutson, Ehud Sprinzak (1990:79), an American-educated Israeli political scientist, notes: \"It appears that, as radicalization deepens, the collective group identity takes over much of the individual identity of the members; and, at the terrorist stage, the group identity reaches its peak.\" This group identity becomes of paramount importance. As Post (1990:38) explains: \"Terrorists whose only sense of significance comes from being terrorists cannot be forced to give up terrorism, for to do so would be to lose their very reason for being.\" The terrorist group displays the characteristics of Groupthink (see Glossary), as described by I. Janis (1972). Among the characteristics that Janis ascribes to groups demonstrating Groupthink are illusions of invulnerability leading to excessive optimism and excessive risk taking, presumptions of the group's morality, one-dimensional perceptions of the enemy as evil, and intolerance of challenges by a group member to shared key beliefs. Some important principles of group dynamics among legally operating groups can also be usefully applied to the analysis of terrorist group dynamics.

Among the characteristics that Janis ascribes to groups demonstrating Groupthink are illusions of invulnerability leading to excessive optimism and excessive risk taking, presumptions of the group's morality, one-dimensional perceptions of the enemy as evil, and intolerance of challenges by a group member to shared key beliefs. Some important principles of group dynamics among legally operating groups can also be usefully applied to the analysis of terrorist group dynamics. One generally accepted principle, as demonstrated by W. Bion (1961), is that individual judgment and behavior are strongly influenced by the powerful forces of group dynamics. Every group, according to Bion, has two opposing forces--a rare tendency to act in a fully cooperative, goal-directed, conflict-free manner to accomplish its stated purposes, and a stronger tendency to sabotage the stated goals. The latter tendency results in a group that defines itself in relation to the outside world and acts as if the only way it can survive is by fighting against or fleeing from the perceived enemy; a group that looks for direction to an omnipotent leader, to whom they subordinate their own independent judgment and act as if they do not have minds of their own; and a group that acts as if the group will bring forth a messiah who will rescue them and create a better world. Post believes that the terrorist group is the apotheosis of the sabotage tendency, regularly exhibiting all three of these symptoms. Both structure and social origin need to be examined in any assessment of terrorist group dynamics. In Post's (1987) view, structural analysis in particular requires identification of the locus of power. In the autonomous terrorist action cell, the cell leader is within the cell, a situation that tends to promote tension. In contrast, the action cells of a terrorist group with a well-differentiated structure are organized within columns, thereby allowing policy decisions to be developed outside the cells. Post found that group psychology provides more insights into the ways of terrorists than individual psychology does. After concluding, unconvincingly, that there is no terrorist mindset, he turned his attention to studying the family backgrounds of terrorists. He found that the group dynamics of nationalist-separatist groups and anarchic-ideological groups differ significantly. Members of nationalist-separatist groups are often known in their communities and maintain relationships with friends and family outside the terrorist group, moving into and out of the community with relative ease. In contrast, members of anarchic-ideological groups have irrevocably severed ties with family and community and lack their support. As a result, the terrorist group is the only source of information and security, a situation that produces pressure to conform and to commit acts of terrorism. ***Pressures to Conform*** Peer pressure, group solidarity, and the psychology of group dynamics help to pressure an individual member to remain in the terrorist group. According to Post (1986),", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:38:d887239380c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8592, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "of the community with relative ease.

As a result, the terrorist group is the only source of information and security, a situation that produces pressure to conform and to commit acts of terrorism. ***Pressures to Conform*** Peer pressure, group solidarity, and the psychology of group dynamics help to pressure an individual member to remain in the terrorist group. According to Post (1986), terrorists tend to submerge their own identities into the group, resulting in a kind of \"group mind\" and group moral code that requires unquestioned obedience to the group. As Crenshaw (1985) has observed, \"The group, as selector and interpreter of ideology, is central.\" Group cohesion increases or decreases depending on the degree of outside danger facing the group. The need to belong to a group motivates most terrorists who are followers to join a terrorist group. Behavior among terrorists is similar, in Post's analysis, because of this need by alienated individuals to belong. For the new recruit, the terrorist group becomes a substitute family, and the group's leaders become substitute parents. An implied corollary of Post's observation that a key motivation for membership in a terrorist group is the sense of belonging and the fraternity of like-minded individuals is the assumption that there must be considerable apprehension among members that the group could be disbanded. As the group comes under attack from security forces, the tendency would be for the group to become more cohesive. A member with wavering commitment who attempts to question group decisions or ideology or to quit under outside pressure against the group would likely face very serious sanctions. Terrorist groups are known to retaliate violently against members who seek to drop out. In 1972, when half of the 30-member Rengo Sekigun (Red Army) terrorist group, which became known as the JRA, objected to the group's strategy, the dissenters, who included a pregnant woman who was thought to be \"too bourgeois,\" were tied to stakes in the northern mountains of Japan, whipped with wires, and left to die of exposure. By most accounts, the decision to join a terrorist group or, for that matter, a terrorist cult like Aum Shinrikyo, is often an irrevocable one. ***Pressures to Commit Acts of Violence*** Post (1990:35) argues that \"individuals become terrorists in order to join terrorist groups and commit acts of terrorism.\" Joining a terrorist group gives them a sense of \"revolutionary heroism\" and self-importance that they previously lacked as individuals. Consequently, a leader who is action-oriented is likely to have a stronger position within the group than one who advocates prudence and moderation. Thomas Strentz (1981:89) has pointed out that terrorist groups that operate against democracies often have a field commander who he calls an \"opportunist,\" that is, an activist, usually a male, whose criminal activity predates his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:39:d20196e93caf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8593, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "acts of terrorism.\" Joining a terrorist group gives them a sense of \"revolutionary heroism\" and self-importance that they previously lacked as individuals. Consequently, a leader who is action-oriented is likely to have a stronger position within the group than one who advocates prudence and moderation. Thomas Strentz (1981:89) has pointed out that terrorist groups that operate against democracies often have a field commander who he calls an \"opportunist,\" that is, an activist, usually a male, whose criminal activity predates his political involvement. Strentz applies the psychological classification of the antisocial personality, also known as a sociopath or psychopath, to the life-style of this type of action-oriented individual. His examples of this personality type include Andreas Baader and Hans Joachim Klein of the Baader-Meinhof Gang and Akira Nihei of the JRA. Although the opportunist is not mentally ill, Strentz explains, he \"is oblivious to the needs of others and unencumbered by the capacity to feel guilt or empathy.\" By most accounts, Baader was unpleasant, constantly abusive toward other members of the group, ill-read, and an action-oriented individual with a criminal past. Often recruited by the group's leader, the opportunist may eventually seek to take over the group, giving rise to increasing tensions between him and the leader. Often the leader will manipulate the opportunist by allowing him the fantasy of leading the group. On the basis of his observation of underground resistance groups during World War II, J.K. Zawodny (1978) concluded that the primary determinant of underground group decision making is not the external reality but the psychological climate within the group. For action-oriented terrorists, inaction is extremely stressful. For action-oriented members, if the group is not taking action then there is no justification for the group. Action relieves stress by reaffirming to these members that they have a purpose. Thus, in Zawodny's analysis, a terrorist group needs to commit acts of terrorism in order to justify its existence. Other terrorists may feel that their personal honor depends on the degree of violence that they carry out against the enemy. In 1970 Black September's Salah Khalef (\"Abu Iyad\") was captured by the Jordanians and then released after he appealed to his comrades to stop fighting and to lay down their arms. Dobson (1975:52) reports that, according to the Jordanians, Abu Iyad \"was subjected to such ridicule by the guerrillas who had fought on that he reacted by turning from moderation to the utmost violence.\" Pearlstein points out that other examples of the political terrorist's self-justification of his or her terrorist actions include the terrorist's taking credit for a given terrorist act and forewarning of terrorist acts to come. By taking credit for an act of terrorism, the terrorist or terrorist group not only advertises the group's cause but also communicates a rhetorical self-justification of the terrorist act and the cause for which it was perpetrated.

By taking credit for an act of terrorism, the terrorist or terrorist group not only advertises the group's cause but also communicates a rhetorical self-justification of the terrorist act and the cause for which it was perpetrated. By threatening future terrorism, the terrorist or terrorist group in effect absolves itself of responsibility for any casualties that may result. ***Terrorist Rationalization of Violence*** Living underground, terrorists gradually become divorced from reality, engaging in what Ferracuti (1982) has described as a \"fantasy war.\" The stresses that accompany their underground, covert lives as terrorists may also have adverse social and psychological consequences for them. Thus, as Taylor (1988:93) points out, although \"mental illness may not be a particularly helpful way of conceptualizing terrorism, the acts of terrorism and membership in a terrorist organization may well have implications for the terrorist's mental health.\" Albert Bandura (1990) has described four techniques of moral disengagement that a terrorist group can use to insulate itself from the human consequences of its actions. First, by using moral justification terrorists may imagine themselves as the saviors of a constituency threatened by a great evil. For example, Donatella della Porta (1992:286), who interviewed members of left-wing militant groups in Italy and Germany, observed that the militants \"began to perceive themselves as members of a heroic community of generous people fighting a war against 'evil.'\" Second, through the technique of displacement of responsibility onto the leader or other members of the group, terrorists portray themselves as functionaries who are merely following their leader's orders. Conversely, the terrorist may blame other members of the group. Groups that are organized into cells and columns may be more capable of carrying out ruthless operations because of the potential for displacement of responsibility. Della Porta's interviews with left-wing militants suggest that the more compartmentalized a group is the more it begins to lose touch with reality, including the actual impact of its own actions. Other manifestations of this displacement technique include accusations made by Asahara, the leader of Aum Shinrikyo, that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used chemical agents against him and the Japanese population. A third technique is to minimize or ignore the actual suffering of the victims. As Bonnie Cordes (1987) points out, terrorists are able to insulate themselves from moral anxieties provoked by the results of their hit-and-run attacks, such as the use of time bombs, by usually not having to witness first-hand the carnage resulting from them, and by concerning themselves with the reactions of the authorities rather than with civilian casualties. Nevertheless, she notes that \"Debates over the justification of violence, the types of targets, and the issue of indiscriminate versus discriminate killing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:41:1ba4d2799dae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8595, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "victims.

Nevertheless, she notes that \"Debates over the justification of violence, the types of targets, and the issue of indiscriminate versus discriminate killing are endemic to a terrorist group.\" Often, these internal debates result in schisms. The fourth technique of moral disengagement described by Bandura is to dehumanize victims or, in the case of Islamist groups, to refer to them as \"the infidel.\" Italian and German militants justified violence by depersonalizing their victims as \"tools of the system,\" \"pigs,\" or \"watch dogs.\" Psychologist Frederick Hacker (1996:162) points out that terrorists transform their victims into mere objects, for \"terroristic thinking and practices reduce individuals to the status of puppets.\" Cordes, too, notes the role reversal played by terrorists in characterizing the enemy as the conspirator and oppressor and accusing it of state terrorism, while referring to themselves as \"freedom fighters\" or \"revolutionaries.\" As Cordes explains, \"Renaming themselves, their actions, their victims and their enemies accords the terrorist respectability.\" By using semantics to rationalize their terrorist violence, however, terrorists may create their own self-destructive psychological tensions. As David C. Rapoport (1971:42) explains: All terrorists must deny the relevance of guilt and innocence, but in doing so they create an unbearable tension in their own souls, for they are in effect saying that a person is not a person. It is no accident that left-wing terrorists constantly speak of a \"pig-society,\" by convincing *themselves* that they are confronting animals they hope to stay the remorse which the slaughter of the innocent necessarily generates. Expanding on this rationalization of guilt, D. Guttman (1979:525) argues that \"The terrorist asserts that he loves only the socially redeeming qualities of his murderous act, not the act itself.\" By this logic, the conscience of the terrorist is turned against those who oppose his violent ways, not against himself. Thus, in Guttman's analysis, the terrorist has projected his guilt outward. In order to absolve his own guilt, the terrorist must claim that under the circumstances he has no choice but to do what he must do. Although other options actually are open to the terrorist, Guttman believes that the liberal audience legitimizes the terrorist by accepting this rationalization of murder. Some terrorists, however, have been trained or brainwashed enough not to feel any remorse, until confronted with the consequences of their actions. When journalist Eileen MacDonald asked a female ETA commando, \"Amaia,\" how she felt when she heard that her bombs had been successful, she replied, after first denying being responsible for killing anyone: \"Satisfaction.

When journalist Eileen MacDonald asked a female ETA commando, \"Amaia,\" how she felt when she heard that her bombs had been successful, she replied, after first denying being responsible for killing anyone: \"Satisfaction. The bastards, they deserved it. Yes, I planted bombs that killed people.\" However, MacDonald felt that Amaia, who had joined the military wing at age 18, had never before questioned the consequences of her actions, and MacDonald's intuition was confirmed as Amaia's mood shifted from bravado to despondency, as she buried her head in her arms, and then groaned: \"Oh, God, this is getting hard,\" and lamented that she had not prepared herself for the interview. When Kim Hyun Hee (1993:104), the bomber of Korean Air Flight 858, activated the bomb, she had no moral qualms. \"At that moment,\" she writes, \"I felt no guilt or remorse at what I was doing; I thought only of completing the mission and not letting my country down.\" It was not until her 1988 trial, which resulted in a death sentence--she was pardoned a year later because she had been brainwashed--that she felt any remorse. \"But being made to confront the victims' grieving families here in this courtroom,\" she writes, \"I finally began to feel, deep down, the sheer horror of the atrocity I'd committed.\" One related characteristic of Kim, as told by one of her South Korean minders to McDonald, is that she had not shown any emotion whatsoever to anyone in the two years she (the minder) had known her. **The Terrorist's Ideological or Religious Perception** Terrorists do not perceive the world as members of governments or civil society do. Their belief systems help to determine their strategies and how they react to government policies. As Martha Crenshaw (1988:12) has observed, \"The actions of terrorist organizations are based on a subjective interpretation of the world rather than objective reality.\"The variables from which their belief systems are formed include their political and social environments, cultural traditions, and the internal dynamics of their clandestine groups. Their convictions may seem irrational or delusional to society in general, but the terrorists may nevertheless act rationally in their commitment to acting on their convictions. According to cognitive theory, an individual's mental activities (perception, memory, and reasoning) are important determinants of behavior. Cognition is an important concept in psychology, for it is the general process by which individuals come to know about and make sense of the world. Terrorists view the world within the narrow lens of their own ideology, whether it be Marxism-Leninism, anarchism, nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism (see Glossary), or some other ideology.

Terrorists view the world within the narrow lens of their own ideology, whether it be Marxism-Leninism, anarchism, nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism (see Glossary), or some other ideology. Most researchers agree that terrorists generally do not regard themselves as terrorists but rather as soldiers, liberators, martyrs, and legitimate fighters for noble social causes. Those terrorists who recognize that their actions are terroristic are so committed to their cause that they do not really care how they are viewed in the outside world. Others may be just as committed, but loathe to be identified as terrorists as opposed to freedom fighters or national liberators. Kristen Renwick Monroe and Lina Haddad Kreidie (1997) have found *perspective*--the idea that we all have a view of the world, a view of ourselves, a view of others, and a view of ourselves in relation to others--to be a very useful tool in understanding fundamentalism, for example. Their underlying hypothesis is that the perspectives of fundamentalists resemble one another and that they differ in significant and consistent ways from the perspectives of nonfundamentalists. Monroe and Kreidie conclude that \"fundamentalists see themselves not as individuals but rather as symbols of Islam.\" They argue that it is a mistake for Western policymakers to treat Islamic fundamentalists as rational actors and dismiss them as irrational when they do not act as predicted by traditional cost/benefit models. \"Islamic fundamentalism should not be dealt with simply as another set of political values that can be compromised or negotiated, or even as a system of beliefs or ideology--such as socialism or communism--in which traditional liberal democratic modes of political discourse and interaction are recognized.\" They point out that \"Islamic fundamentalism taps into a quite different political consciousness, one in which religious identity sets and determines the range of options open to the fundamentalist. It extends to all areas of life and respects no separation between the private and the political.\" Existing works that attempt to explain religious fundamentalism often rely on modernization theory and point to a crisis of identity, explaining religious fundamentalism as an antidote to the dislocations resulting from rapid change, or modernization. Islamic fundamentalism in particular is often explained as a defense against threats posed by modernization to a religious group's traditional identity. Rejecting the idea of fundamentalism as pathology, rational choice theorists point to unequal socioeconomic development as the basic reason for the discontent and alienation these individuals experience. Caught between an Islamic culture that provides moral values and spiritual satisfaction and a modernizing Western culture that provides access to material improvement, many Muslims find an answer to resulting anxiety, alienation, and disorientation through an absolute", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:44:15402d069294", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8598, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "often explained as a defense against threats posed by modernization to a religious group's traditional identity.

Caught between an Islamic culture that provides moral values and spiritual satisfaction and a modernizing Western culture that provides access to material improvement, many Muslims find an answer to resulting anxiety, alienation, and disorientation through an absolute dedication to an Islamic way of life. Accordingly, the Islamic fundamentalist is commonly depicted as an acutely alienated individual, with dogmatic and rigid beliefs and an inferiority complex, and as idealistic and devoted to an austere lifestyle filled with struggle and sacrifice. In the 1990s, however, empirical studies of Islamic groups have questioned this view. V. J. Hoffman-Ladd, for example, suggests that fundamentalists are not necessarily ignorant and downtrodden, according to the stereotype, but frequently students and university graduates in the physical sciences, although often students with rural or traditionally religious backgrounds. In his view, fundamentalism is more of a revolt of young people caught between a traditional past and a secular Western education. R. Euben and Bernard Lewis argue separately that there is a cognitive collision between Western and fundamentalist worldviews. Focusing on Sunni fundamentalists, Euben argues that their goals are perceived not as self-interests but rather as moral imperatives, and that their worldviews differ in critical ways from Western worldviews. By having moral imperatives as their goals, the fundamentalist groups perceive the world through the distorting lens of their religious beliefs. Although the perceptions of the secular Arab terrorist groups are not so clouded by religious beliefs, these groups have their own ideological imperatives that distort their ability to see the world with a reasonable amount of objectivity. As a result, their perception of the world is as distorted as that of the fundamentalists. Consequently, the secular groups are just as likely to misjudge political, economic, and social realities as are the fundamentalist groups. For example, Harold M. Cubert argues that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), guided by Marxist economic ideology, has misjudged the reasons for popular hostility in the Middle East against the West, \"for such hostility, where it exists, is generally in response to the threat which Western culture is said to pose to Islamic values in the region rather than the alleged economic exploitation of the region's inhabitants.\" This trend has made the PFLP's appeals for class warfare irrelevant, whereas calls by Islamist groups for preserving the region's cultural and religious identity have been well received, at least among the nonsecular sectors of the population. **TERRORIST PROFILING** **Hazards of Terrorist Profiling** The isolation of attributes or traits shared by terrorists is a formidable task because there are probably as many variations among terrorists as there may be similarities.

Efforts by scholars to create a profile of a \"typical\" terrorist have had mixed success, if any, and the assumption that there is such a profile has not been proven. Post (1985:103) note that \"behavioral scientists attempting to understand the psychology of individuals drawn to this violent political behavior have not succeeded in identifying a unique \"terrorist mindset.\" People who have joined terrorist groups have come from a wide range of cultures, nationalities, and ideological causes, all strata of society, and diverse professions. Their personalities and characteristics are as diverse as those of people in the general population. There seems to be general agreement among psychologists that there is no particular psychological attribute that can be used to describe the terrorist or any \"personality\" that is distinctive of terrorists. Some terrorism experts are skeptical about terrorist profiling. For example, Laqueur (1997:129) holds that the search for a \"terrorist personality\" is a fruitless one. Paul Wilkinson (1997:193) maintains that \"We already know enough about terrorist behavior to discount the crude hypothesis of a 'terrorist personality' or 'phenotype.' The U.S. Secret Service once watched for people who fit the popular profile of dangerousness--the lunatic, the loner, the threatener, the hater. That profile, however, was shattered by the assassins themselves. In interviews with assassins in prisons, hospitals, and homes, the Secret Service learned an important lesson--to discard stereotypes. Killers are not necessarily mentally ill, socially isolated, or even male. Now the Secret Service looks for patterns of motive and behavior in potential presidential assassins. The same research methodology applies to potential terrorists. Assassins, like terrorists in general, use common techniques. For example, the terrorist would not necessarily threaten to assassinate a politician in advance, for to do so would make it more difficult to carry out the deed. In its detailed study of 83 people who tried to kill a public official or a celebrity in the United States in the past 50 years, the Secret Service found that not one assassin had made a threat. Imprisoned assassins told the Secret Service that a threat would keep them from succeeding, so why would they threaten? This was the second important lesson learned from the study. The diversity of terrorist groups, each with members of widely divergent national and sociocultural backgrounds, contexts, and goals, underscores the hazards of making generalizations and developing a profile of members of individual groups or of terrorists in general.

The diversity of terrorist groups, each with members of widely divergent national and sociocultural backgrounds, contexts, and goals, underscores the hazards of making generalizations and developing a profile of members of individual groups or of terrorists in general. Post cautions that efforts to provide an overall \"terrorist profile\" are misleading: \"There are nearly as many variants of personality who become involved in terrorist pursuits as there are variants of personality.\" Many theories are based on the assumption that the terrorist has an \"abnormal\" personality with clearly identifiable character traits that can be explained adequately with insights from psychology and psychiatry. Based on his work with various West German terrorists, one German psychologist, L. Sullwold (1981), divided terrorist leaders into two broad classes of personality traits: the extrovert and the hostile neurotic, or one having the syndrome of neurotic hostility. Extroverts are unstable, uninhibited, inconsiderate, self-interested, and unemotional--thrill seekers with little regard for the consequences of their actions. Hostile neurotics share many features of the paranoid personality--they are intolerant of criticism, suspicious, aggressive, and defensive, as well as extremely sensitive to external hostility. Sullwold also distinguishes between leaders and followers, in that leaders are more likely to be people who combine a lack of scruples with extreme self-assurance; they often lead by frightening or pressuring their followers. Some researchers have created psychological profiles of terrorists by using data provided by former terrorists who became informants, changed their political allegiance, or were captured. Franco Ferracuti conducted one such study of the Red Brigade terrorists in Italy. He analyzed the career and personalities of arrested terrorists by collecting information on demographic variables and by applying psychological tests to construct a typology of terrorists. Like Post, Ferracuti also found, for the most part, the absence of psychopathology (see Glossary), and he observed similar personality characteristics, that is, a basic division between extroverts and hostile neurotics. By reading and studying terrorist literature, such as group communiqués, news media interviews, and memoirs of former members, it would also be possible to ascertain certain vulnerabilities within the group by pinpointing its sensitivities, internal disagreements, and moral weaknesses. This kind of information would assist in developing a psychological profile of the group. Post points out that the social dynamics of the \"anarchic-ideologues,\" such as the RAF, differ strikingly from the \"nationalist-separatists,\" such as ETA or the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). From studies of terrorists, Post (1990) has observed indications that terrorists, such as those of the ETA, who pursue a conservative goal, such as freedom for the Basque people, have been reared in more traditional, intact, conservative families, whereas anarchistic and left-wing terrorists (such", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:47:acffdde3929c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8601, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "of the group.

From studies of terrorists, Post (1990) has observed indications that terrorists, such as those of the ETA, who pursue a conservative goal, such as freedom for the Basque people, have been reared in more traditional, intact, conservative families, whereas anarchistic and left-wing terrorists (such as members of the Meinhof Gang/RAF) come from less conventional, nonintact families. In developing this dichotomy between separatists and anarchists, Post draws on Robert Clark's studies of the social backgrounds of the separatist terrorists of the ETA. Clark also found that ETA terrorists are not alienated and psychologically distressed. Rather, they are psychologically healthy people who are strongly supported by their families and ethnic community. Post bases his observations of anarchists on a broad-cased investigation of the social background and psychology of 250 terrorists (227 left-wing and 23 right-wing) conducted by a consortium of West German social scientists under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Interior and published in four volumes in 1981-84. According to these West German analyses of RAF and June Second Movement terrorists, some 25 percent of the leftist terrorists had lost one or both parents by the age of fourteen and 79 percent reported severe conflict with other people, especially with parents (33 percent). The German authors conclude in general that the 250 terrorist lives demonstrated a pattern of failure both educationally and vocationally. Post concludes that \"nationalist-separatist\" terrorists such as the ETA are loyal to parents who are disloyal to their regime, whereas \"anarchic-ideologues\" are disloyal to their parents' generation, which is identified with the establishment. **Sociological Characteristics of Terrorists in the Cold War Period** ***A Basic Profile*** Profiles of terrorists have included a profile constructed by Charles A. Russell and Bowman H. Miller (1977), which has been widely mentioned in terrorism-related studies, despite its limitations, and another study that involved systematically analyzing biographical and social data on about 250 German terrorists, both left-wing and right-right. Russell and Bowman attempt to draw a sociological portrait or profile of the modern urban terrorist based on a compilation and analysis of more than 350 individual terrorist cadres and leaders from Argentinian, Brazilian, German, Iranian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Palestinian, Spanish, Turkish, and Uruguayan terrorist groups active during the 1966-76 period, the first decade of the contemporary terrorist era. Russell and Bowman (1977:31) conclude: In summation, one can draw a general composite picture into which fit the great majority of those terrorists from the eighteen urban guerrilla groups examined here. To this point, they have been largely single males aged 22 to 24...who have some university education, if not a college degree.

To this point, they have been largely single males aged 22 to 24...who have some university education, if not a college degree. The female terrorists, except for the West German groups and an occasional leading figure in the JRA and PFLP, are preoccupied with support rather than operational roles....Whether having turned to terrorism as a university student or only later, most were provided an anarchist or Marxist world view, as well as recruited into terrorist operations while in the university. Russell and Miller's profile tends to substantiate some widely reported sociological characteristics of terrorists in the 1970s, such as the youth of most terrorists. Of particular interest is their finding that urban terrorists have largely urban origins and that many terrorist cadres have predominantly middle-class or even upper-class backgrounds and are well educated, with many having university degrees. However, like most such profiles that are based largely on secondary sources, such as newspaper articles and academic studies, the Russell and Miller profile cannot be regarded as definitive. Furthermore, their methodological approach lacks validity. It is fallacious to assume that one can compare characteristics of members of numerous terrorist groups in various regions of the world and then make generalizations about these traits. For example, the authors' conclusion that terrorists are largely single young males from urban, middle-class or upper-middle-class backgrounds with some university education would not accurately describe many members of terrorist groups operating in the 1990s. The rank and file of Latin American groups such as the FARC and Shining Path, Middle Eastern groups such as the Armed Islamic Group (Group Islamique Armé--GIA), Hamas, and Hizballah, Asian groups such as the LTTE, and Irish groups such as the IRA are poorly educated. Although the Russell and Miller profile is dated, it can still be used as a basic guide for making some generalizations about typical personal attributes of terrorists, in combination with other information. Edgar O'Ballance (1979) suggests the following essential characteristics of the \"successful\" terrorist: dedication, including absolute obedience to the leader of the movement; personal bravery; a lack of feelings of pity or remorse even though victims are likely to include innocent men, women, and children; a fairly high standard of intelligence, for a terrorist must collect and analyze information, devise and implement complex plans, and evade police and security forces; a fairly high degree of sophistication, in order to be able to blend into the first-class section on airliners, stay at first-class hotels, and mix inconspicuously with the international executive set; and be a reasonably good educational background and possession of a fair share of general knowledge (a university degree is almost mandatory), including being", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:49:785ec9c6212c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8603, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "a fairly high standard of intelligence, for a terrorist must collect and analyze information, devise and implement complex plans, and evade police and security forces; a fairly high degree of sophistication, in order to be able to blend into the first-class section on airliners, stay at first-class hotels, and mix inconspicuously with the international executive set; and be a reasonably good educational background and possession of a fair share of general knowledge (a university degree is almost mandatory), including being able to speak English as well as one other major language. Increasingly, terrorist groups are recruiting members who possess a high degree of intellectualism and idealism, are highly educated, and are well trained in a legitimate profession. However, this may not necessarily be the case with the younger, lower ranks of large guerrilla/terrorist organizations in less-developed countries, such as the FARC, the PKK, the LTTE, and Arab groups, as well as with some of the leaders of these groups. **Age** Russell and Miller found that the average age of an active terrorist member (as opposed to a leader) was between 22 and 25, except for Palestinian, German, and Japanese terrorists, who were between 20 and 25 years old. Another source explains that the first generation of RAF terrorists went underground at approximately 22 to 23 years of age, and that the average age shifted to 28 to 30 years for second-generation terrorists (June Second Movement). In summarizing the literature about international terrorists in the 1980s, Taylor (1988) characterizes their demography as being in their early twenties and unmarried, but he notes that there is considerable variability from group to group. Age trends for members of many terrorist groups were dropping in the 1980s, with various groups, such as the LTTE, having many members in the 16- to 17 year-old age level and even members who were preteens. Laqueur notes that Arab and Iranian groups tend to use boys aged 14 to 15 for dangerous missions, in part because they are less likely to question instructions and in part because they are less likely to attract attention. In many countries wracked by ethnic, political, or religious violence in the developing world, such as Algeria, Colombia, and Sri Lanka, new members of terrorist organizations are recruited at younger and younger ages. Adolescents and preteens in these countries are often receptive to terrorist recruitment because they have witnessed killings first-hand and thus see violence as the only way to deal with grievances and problems. In general, terrorist leaders tend to be much older. Brazil's Carlos Marighella, considered to be the leading theoretician of urban terrorism, was 58 at the time of his violent death on November 6, 1969. Mario Santucho, leader of Argentina's People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), was 40 at the time of his violent death in July 1976. Ral Sendic, leader of the Uruguayan Tupamaros, was 42 when his group began operating", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:50:f778f40359fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8604, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "violence as the only way to deal with grievances and problems.

Mario Santucho, leader of Argentina's People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), was 40 at the time of his violent death in July 1976. Ral Sendic, leader of the Uruguayan Tupamaros, was 42 when his group began operating in the late 1960s. Renato Curcio, leader of the Italian Red Brigades, was 35 at the time of his arrest in early 1976. Leaders of the Baader-Meinhof Gang were in their 30s or 40s. Palestinian terrorist leaders are often in their 40s or 50s. **Educational, Occupational, and Socioeconomic Background** Terrorists in general have more than average education, and very few Western terrorists are uneducated or illiterate. Russell and Miller found that about two-thirds of terrorist group members had some form of university training. The occupations of terrorist recruits have varied widely, and there does not appear to be any occupation in particular that produces terrorists, other than the ranks of the unemployed and students. Between 50 and 70 percent of the younger members of Latin American urban terrorist groups were students. The Free University of Berlin was a particularly fertile recruiting ground for Germany's June Second Movement and Baader-Meinhof Gang. Highly educated recruits were normally given leadership positions, whether at the cell level or national level. The occupations of terrorist leaders have likewise varied. Older members and leaders frequently were professionals such as doctors, bankers, lawyers, engineers, journalists, university professors, and mid-level government executives. Marighella was a politician and former congressman. The PFLP's George Habash was a medical doctor. The PLO's Yasir Arafat was a graduate engineer. Mario Santucho was an economist. Ral Sendic and the Baader-Meinhof's Horst Mahler were lawyers. Urika Meinhof was a journalist. The RAF and Red Brigades were composed almost exclusively of disenchanted intellectuals. It may be somewhat misleading to regard terrorists in general as former professionals. Many terrorists who have been able to remain anonymous probably continue to practice their legitimate professions and moonlight as terrorists only when they receive instructions to carry out a mission. This may be more true about separatist organizations, such as the ETA and IRA, whose members are integrated into their communities, than about members of anarchist groups, such as the former Baader-Meinhof Gang, who are more likely to be on wanted posters, on the run, and too stressed to be able to function in a normal day-time job. In response to police infiltration, the ETA, for example, instituted a system of \"sleeping commandos.\" These passive ETA members, both men and women, lead seemingly normal lives, with regular jobs, but after work they are trained for specific ETA missions. Usually unaware of each others' real identities, they receive coded instructions", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:51:313710c4943d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8605, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "the former Baader-Meinhof Gang, who are more likely to be on wanted posters, on the run, and too stressed to be able to function in a normal day-time job.

Usually unaware of each others' real identities, they receive coded instructions from an anonymous source. After carrying out their assigned actions, they resume their normal lives. Whereas terrorism for anarchistic groups such as the RAF and Red Brigades was a full-time profession, young ETA members serve an average of only three years before they are rotated back into the mainstream of society. Russell and Miller found that more than two-thirds of the terrorists surveyed came from middle-class or even upper-class backgrounds. With the main exception of large guerrilla/terrorist organizations such as the FARC, the PKK, the LTTE, and the Palestinian or Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organizations, terrorists come from middle-class families. European and Japanese terrorists are more likely the products of affluence and higher education than of poverty. For example, the RAF and Red Brigades were composed almost exclusively of middle-class dropouts, and most JRA members were from middle-class families and were university dropouts. Well-off young people, particularly in the United States, West Europe, and Japan, have been attracted to political radicalism out of a profound sense of guilt over the plight of the world's largely poor population. The backgrounds of the Baader-Meinhof Gang's members illustrate this in particular: Suzanne Albrecht, daughter of a wealthy maritime lawyer; Baader, the son of an historian; Meinhof, the daughter of an art historian; Horst Mahler, the son of a dentist; Holger Meins, the son of a business executive. According to Russell and Miller, about 80 percent of the Baader-Meinhof Gang had university experience. Major exceptions to the middle- and upper-class origins of terrorist groups in general include three large organizations examined in this study--the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK--as well as the paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. Both the memberships of the Protestant groups, such as the Ulster Volunteer Force, and the Catholic groups, such as the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA, and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), are almost all drawn from the working class. These paramilitary groups are also different in that their members normally do not have any university education. Although Latin America has been an exception, terrorists in much of the developing world tend to be drawn from the lower sections of society. The rank and file of Arab terrorist organizations include substantial numbers of poor people, many of them homeless refugees. Arab terrorist leaders are almost all from the middle and upper classes. **General Traits** Terrorists are generally people who feel alienated from society and have a grievance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:52:062dbb41f40f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8606, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "that their members normally do not have any university education. Although Latin America has been an exception, terrorists in much of the developing world tend to be drawn from the lower sections of society. The rank and file of Arab terrorist organizations include substantial numbers of poor people, many of them homeless refugees. Arab terrorist leaders are almost all from the middle and upper classes. **General Traits** Terrorists are generally people who feel alienated from society and have a grievance or regard themselves as victims of an injustice. Many are dropouts. They are devoted to their political or religious cause and do not regard their violent actions as criminal. They are loyal to each other but will deal with a disloyal member more harshly than with the enemy. They are people with cunning, skill, and initiative, as well as ruthlessness. In order to be initiated into the group, the new recruit may be expected to perform an armed robbery or murder. They show no fear, pity, or remorse. The sophistication of the terrorist will vary depending on the significance and context of the terrorist action. The Colombian hostage-takers who infiltrated an embassy party and the Palace of Justice, for example, were far more sophisticated than would be, for example, Punjab terrorists who gun down bus passengers. Terrorists have the ability to use a variety of weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment and are familiar with their physical environment, whether it be a 747 jumbo jet or a national courthouse. A terrorist will rarely operate by himself/herself or in large groups, unless the operation requires taking over a large building, for example. Members of Right-wing terrorist groups in France and Germany, as elsewhere, generally tend to be young, relatively uneducated members of the lower classes (see Table 1, Appendix). Ferracuti and F. Bruno (1981:209) list nine psychological traits common to right-wing terrorists: ambivalence toward authority; poor and defective insight; adherence to conventional behavioral patterns; emotional detachment from the consequences of their actions; disturbances in sexual identity with role uncertainties; superstition, magic, and stereotyped thinking; etero- and auto-destructiveness; low-level educational reference patterns; and perception of weapons as fetishes and adherence to violent subcultural norms. These traits make up what Ferracuti and Bruno call an \"authoritarian-extremist personality.\" They conclude that right-wing terrorism may be more dangerous than left-wing terrorism because \"in right-wing terrorism, the individuals are frequently psychopathological and the ideology is empty: ideology is outside reality, and the terrorists are both more normal and more fanatical.\" **Marital Status** In the past, most terrorists have been unmarried. Russell and Miller found that, according to arrest statistics, more than 75 to 80 percent of terrorists in the various regions in the late 1970s were single. Encumbering family responsibilities are generally precluded by requirements for mobility, flexibility, initiative, security, and total dedication to a revolutionary cause. Roughly 20 percent of foreign terrorist group memberships apparently consisted", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:53:3e3784c3c762", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8607, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "is outside reality, and the terrorists are both more normal and more fanatical.\" **Marital Status** In the past, most terrorists have been unmarried.

Encumbering family responsibilities are generally precluded by requirements for mobility, flexibility, initiative, security, and total dedication to a revolutionary cause. Roughly 20 percent of foreign terrorist group memberships apparently consisted of married couples, if Russell and Miller's figure on single terrorists was accurate. **Physical Appearance** Terrorists are healthy and strong but generally undistinguished in appearance and manner. The physical fitness of some may be enhanced by having had extensive commando training. They tend to be of medium height and build to blend easily into crowds. They tend not to have abnormal physiognomy and peculiar features, genetic or acquired, that would facilitate their identification. Their dress and hair styles are inconspicuous. In addition to their normal appearance, they talk and behave like normal people. They may even be well dressed if, for example, they need to be in the first-class section of an airliner targeted for hijacking. They may resort to disguise or plastic surgery depending on whether they are on police wanted posters. If a terrorist's face is not known, it is doubtful that a suspected terrorist can be singled out of a crowd only on the basis of physical features. Unlike the *yakuza* (mobsters) in Japan, terrorists generally do not have distinguishing physical features such as colorful tatoos. For example, author Christopher Dobson (1975) describes the Black September's Salah Khalef (\"Abu Iyad\") as \"of medium height and sturdy build, undistinguished in a crowd.\" When Dobson, hoping for an interview, was introduced to him in Cairo in the early 1970s Abu Iyad made \"so little an impression\" during the brief encounter that Dobson did not realize until later that he had already met Israel's most-wanted terrorist. Another example is Imad Mughniyah, head of Hizballah's special operations, who is described by Hala Jaber (1997:120), as \"someone you would pass in the street without even noticing or giving a second glance.\" **Origin: Rural or Urban** Guerrilla/terrorist organizations have tended to recruit members from the areas where they are expected to operate because knowing the area of operation is a basic principle of urban terrorism and guerrilla warfare. According to Russell and Miller, about 90 percent of the Argentine ERP and Montoneros came from the Greater Buenos Aires area. Most of Marighella's followers came from Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, and So Paulo. More than 70 percent of the Tupamaros were natives of Montevideo. Most German and Italian terrorists were from urban areas: the Germans from Hamburg and West Berlin; the Italians from Genoa, Milan, and Rome. **Gender** ***Males*** Most terrorists are male. Well over 80 percent of terrorist operations in the 1966-76", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:54:9b764b711948", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8608, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "about 90 percent of the Argentine ERP and Montoneros came from the Greater Buenos Aires area.

Most German and Italian terrorists were from urban areas: the Germans from Hamburg and West Berlin; the Italians from Genoa, Milan, and Rome. **Gender** ***Males*** Most terrorists are male. Well over 80 percent of terrorist operations in the 1966-76 period were directed, led, and executed by males. The number of arrested female terrorists in Latin America suggested that female membership was less than 16 percent. The role of women in Latin American groups such as the Tupamaros was limited to intelligence collection, serving as couriers or nurses, maintaining safehouses, and so forth. ***Females*** Various terrorism specialists have noted that the number of women involved in terrorism has greatly exceeded the number of women involved in crime. However, no statistics have been offered to substantiate this assertion. Considering that the number of terrorist actions perpetrated worldwide in any given year is probably minuscule in comparison with the common crimes committed in the same period, it is not clear if the assertion is correct. Nevertheless, it indeed seems as if more women are involved in terrorism than actually are, perhaps because they tend to get more attention than women involved in common crime. Although Russell and Miller's profile is more of a sociological than a psychological profile, some of their conclusions raise psychological issues, such as why women played a more prominent role in left-wing terrorism in the 1966-76 period than in violent crime in general. Russell and Miller's data suggest that the terrorists examined were largely males, but the authors also note the secondary support role played by women in most terrorist organizations, particularly the Uruguayan Tupamaros and several European groups. For example, they point out that women constituted one-third of the personnel of the RAF and June Second Movement, and that nearly 60 percent of the RAF and June Second Movement who were at large in August 1976 were women. Russell and Miller's contention that \"urban terrorism remains a predominantly male phenomenon,\" with women functioning mainly in a secondary support role, may underestimate the active, operational role played by women in Latin American and West European terrorist organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Insurgent groups in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s reportedly included large percentages of female combatants: 30 percent of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) combatants in Nicaragua by the late 1970s; one-third of the combined forces of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador; and one-half of the Shining Path terrorists in Peru. However, because these percentages may have been inflated by the insurgent groups to impress foreign feminist sympathizers, no firm conclusions can be drawn in the absence of reliable", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:55:f83693b3f655", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8609, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "the 1970s and 1980s reportedly included large percentages of female combatants: 30 percent of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) combatants in Nicaragua by the late 1970s; one-third of the combined forces of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador; and one-half of the Shining Path terrorists in Peru. However, because these percentages may have been inflated by the insurgent groups to impress foreign feminist sympathizers, no firm conclusions can be drawn in the absence of reliable statistical data. Nevertheless, women have played prominent roles in numerous urban terrorist operations in Latin America. For example, the second in command of the Sandinista takeover of Nicaragua's National Palace in Managua, Nicaragua, in late August 1979 was Dora Mara Téllez Argello. Several female terrorists participated in the takeover of the Dominican Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, by the 19th of April Movement (M-19) in 1980, and one of them played a major role in the hostage negotiations. The late Mélida Anaya Montes (\"Ana Mara\") served as second in command of the People's Liberation Forces (Fuerzas Populares de Liberacin--FPL) prior to her murder at age 54 by FPL rivals in 1983. Half of the 35 M-19 terrorists who raided Colombia's Palace of Justice on November 6, 1985, were women, and they were among the fiercest fighters. Leftist terrorist groups or operations in general have frequently been led by women. Many women joined German terrorist groups. Germany's Red Zora, a terrorist group active between the late 1970s and 1987, recruited only women and perpetrated many terrorist actions. In 1985 the RAF's 22 core activists included 13 women. In 1991 women formed about 50 percent of the RAF membership and about 80 percent of the group's supporters, according to MacDonald. Of the eight individuals on Germany's \"Wanted Terrorists\" list in 1991, five were women. Of the 22 terrorists being hunted by German police that year, 13 were women. Infamous German female terrorist leaders have included Susanne Albrecht, Gudrun Ensselin\\Esslin, and Ulrike Meinhof of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. There are various theories as to why German women have been so drawn to violent groups. One is that they are more emancipated and liberated than women in other European countries. Another, as suggested to Eileen MacDonald by Astrid Proll, an early member of the Baader-Meinhof Gang, is that the anger of German women is part of a national guilt complex, the feeling that if their mothers had had a voice in Hitler's time many of Hitler's atrocities would not have happened. Other noted foreign female terrorists have included Fusako Shigenobu of the JRA (Shigenobu, 53, was reported in April 1997 to be with 14 other JRA members--two other women and 12 men--training FARC guerrillas in terror tactics in the Uraba Region of Colombia); Norma Ester Arostito, who cofounded the Argentine Montoneros and served as its chief ideologist until her violent death in 1976; Margherita Cagol and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:56:fb71d7b2b1ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8610, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "had had a voice in Hitler's time many of Hitler's atrocities would not have happened.

ETA members told journalist Eileen MacDonald that ETA has always had female commandos and operators. Women make up about 10 percent of imprisoned ETA members, so that may be roughly the percentage of women in ETA ranks. Infamous female commandos have included Leila Khaled, a beautiful PFLP commando who hijacked a TWA passenger plane on August 29, 1969, and then blew it up after evacuating the passengers, without causing any casualties (see Leila Khaled, Appendix). One of the first female terrorists of modern international terrorism, she probably inspired hundreds of other angry young women around the world who admired the thrilling pictures of her in newspapers and magazines worldwide showing her cradling a weapon, with her head demurely covered. Another PFLP female hijacker, reportedly a Christian Iraqi, was sipping champagne in the cocktail bar of a Japan Air Lines Jumbo jet on July 20, 1973, when the grenade that she was carrying strapped to her waist exploded, killing her. Women have also played a significant role in Italian terrorist groups. Leonard Weinberg and William Lee Eubank (1987: 248-53) have been able to quantify that role by developing a data file containing information on about 2,512 individuals who were arrested or wanted by police for terrorism from January 1970 through June 1984. Of those people, 451, or 18 percent, were female. Of those females, fewer than 10 percent were affiliated with neofascist groups (see Table 2, Appendix). The rest belonged to leftist terrorist groups, particularly the Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse--BR), which had 215 female members. Weinberg and Eubank found that the Italian women surveyed were represented at all levels of terrorist groups: 33 (7 percent) played leadership roles and 298 (66 percent) were active \"regulars\" who took part in terrorist actions. (see Table 3, Appendix). Weinberg and Eubank found that before the women became involved in terrorism they tended to move from small and medium-sized communities to big cities (see Table 4, Appendix). The largest group of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:57:f7ca1f55d4c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8611, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "(Brigate Rosse--BR), which had 215 female members.

(see Table 3, Appendix). Weinberg and Eubank found that before the women became involved in terrorism they tended to move from small and medium-sized communities to big cities (see Table 4, Appendix). The largest group of the women (35 percent) had been students before becoming terrorists, 20 percent had been teachers, and 23 percent had held white-collar jobs as clerks, secretaries, technicians, and nurses (see Table 5, Appendix). Only a few of the women belonged to political parties or trade union organizations, whereas 80 (17 percent) belonged to leftist extraparliamentary movements. Also noteworthy is the fact that 121 (27 percent) were related by family to other terrorists. These researchers concluded that for many women joining a terrorist group resulted from a small group or family decision. ***Characteristics of Female Terrorists*** **Practicality, Coolness** German intelligence officials told Eileen MacDonald that \"absolute practicality...was particularly noticeable with women revolutionaries.\" By this apparently was meant coolness under pressure. However, Germany's female terrorists, such as those in the Baader-Meinhof Gang, have been described by a former member as \"all pretty male-dominated; I mean they had male characteristics.\" These included interests in technical things, such as repairing cars, driving, accounting, and organizing. For example, the RAF's Astrid Proll was a first-rate mechanic, Gudrun Ensslin was in charge of the RAF's finances, and Ulrike Meinhof sought out apartments for the group. According to Christian Lochte, the Hamburg director of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the most important qualities that a female member could bring to terrorist groups, which are fairly unstable, were practicality and pragmatism: \"In wartime women are much more capable of keeping things together,\" Lochte told MacDonald. \"This is very important for a group of terrorists, for their dynamics. Especially a group like the RAF, where there are a lot of quarrels about strategy, about daily life. Women come to the forefront in such a group, because they are practical.\" Galvin points out the tactical value of women in a terrorist group. An attack by a female terrorist is normally less expected than one by a man. \"A woman, trading on the impression of being a mother, nonviolent, fragile, even victim like, can more easily pass scrutiny by security forces....\" There are numerous examples illustrating the tactical surprise factor that can be achieved by female terrorists. A LTTE female suicide commando was able to get close enough to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991, to garland him with flowers and then set off her body bomb, killing him, herself, and 17 others. Nobody suspected the attractive Miss Kim of carrying a bomb aboard a Korean Air", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:58:3d87838dd4bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8612, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "even victim like, can more easily pass scrutiny by security forces....\" There are numerous examples illustrating the tactical surprise factor that can be achieved by female terrorists. A LTTE female suicide commando was able to get close enough to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991, to garland him with flowers and then set off her body bomb, killing him, herself, and 17 others. Nobody suspected the attractive Miss Kim of carrying a bomb aboard a Korean Air Flight 858. And Leila Khaled, dressed in elegant clothes and strapped with grenades, was able to pass through various El Al security checks without arousing suspicion. Female terrorists have also been used to draw male targets into a situation in which they could be kidnapped or assassinated. **Dedication, Inner Strength, Ruthlessness** Lochte also considered female terrorists to be stronger, more dedicated, faster, and more ruthless than male terrorists, as well as more capable of withstanding suffering because \"They have better nerves than men, and they can be both passive and active at the same time.\" The head of the German counterterrorist squad told MacDonald that the difference between the RAF men and women who had been caught after the fall of the Berlin Wall was that the women had been far more reticent about giving information than the men, and when the women did talk it was for reasons of guilt as opposed to getting a reduced prison sentence, as in the case of their male comrades. According to MacDonald, since the late 1960s, when women began replacing imprisoned or interned male IRA members as active participants, IRA women have played an increasingly important role in \"frontline\" actions against British troops and Protestant paramilitary units, as well as in terrorist actions against the British public. As a result, in the late 1960s the IRA merged its separate women's sections within the movement into one IRA. MacDonald cites several notorious IRA women terrorists. They include Marion Price, 19, and her sister (dubbed \"the Sisters of Death\"), who were part of the IRA's 1973 bombing campaign in London. In the early 1970s, Dr. Rose Dugdale, daughter of a wealthy English family, hijacked a helicopter and used it to try to bomb a police barracks. In 1983 Anna Moore was sentenced to life imprisonment for her role in bombing a Northern Ireland pub in which 17 were killed. Ella O'Dwyer and Martina Anderson, 23, a former local beauty queen, received life sentences in 1986 for their part in the plot to bomb London and 16 seaside resorts. Another such terrorist was Mairead Farrell, who was shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar in 1988. A year before her death, Farrell, who was known for her strong feminist views, said in an interview that she was attracted to the IRA because she was treated the same as \"the lads.\" As of 1992, Evelyn Glenholmes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:59:56cb8539f481", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8613, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 60, "text": "23, a former local beauty queen, received life sentences in 1986 for their part in the plot to bomb London and 16 seaside resorts.

A year before her death, Farrell, who was known for her strong feminist views, said in an interview that she was attracted to the IRA because she was treated the same as \"the lads.\" As of 1992, Evelyn Glenholmes was a fugitive for her role in a series of London bombings. MacDonald interviewed a few of these and a number of other female IRA terrorists, whom she described as all ordinary, some more friendly than others. Most were unmarried teenagers or in their early twenties when they became involved in IRA terrorism. None had been recruited by a boyfriend. When asked why they joined, all responded with \"How could we not?\" replies. They all shared a hatred for the British troops (particularly their foul language and manners) and a total conviction that violence was justified. One female IRA volunteer told MacDonald that \"Everyone is treated the same. During training, men and women are equally taught the use of explosives and weapons.\" **Single-Mindedness** Female terrorists can be far more dangerous than male terrorists because of their ability to focus single-mindedly on the cause and the goal. Lochte noted that the case of Susanne Albrecht demonstrated this total dedication to a cause, to the exclusion of all else, even family ties and upbringing. The RAF's Suzanne Albrecht, daughter of a wealthy maritime lawyer, set up a close family friend, Jurgen Ponto, one of West Germany's richest and most powerful men and chairman of the Dresden Bank, for assassination in his home, even though she later admitted to having experienced nothing but kindness and generosity from him. Lochte told MacDonald that if Albrecht had been a man, she would have tried to convince her RAF comrade to pick another target to kidnap. \"Her attitude was,\" Lochte explained, \"to achieve the goal, to go straight ahead without any interruptions, any faltering. This attitude is not possible with men.\" (Albrecht, however, reportedly was submitted to intense pressure by her comrades to exploit her relationship with the banker, and the plan was only to kidnap him rather than kill him.) After many years of observing German terrorists, Lochte concluded, in his comments to MacDonald, that women would not hesitate to shoot at once if they were cornered. \"For anyone who loves his life,\" he told MacDonald, \"it is a good idea to shoot the women terrorists first.\" In his view, woman terrorists feel they need to show that they can be even more ruthless than men. Germany's neo-Nazi groups also have included female members, who have played major roles, according to MacDonald. For example, Sibylle Vorderbrgge, 26, joined a notorious neo-Nazi group in 1980 after", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:60:c7ad796ca825", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8614, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "women would not hesitate to shoot at once if they were cornered. \"For anyone who loves his life,\" he told MacDonald, \"it is a good idea to shoot the women terrorists first.\" In his view, woman terrorists feel they need to show that they can be even more ruthless than men. Germany's neo-Nazi groups also have included female members, who have played major roles, according to MacDonald. For example, Sibylle Vorderbrgge, 26, joined a notorious neo-Nazi group in 1980 after becoming infatuated with its leader. She then became a bomb-throwing terrorist expressly to please him. According to MacDonald, she was a good example to Christian Lochte of how women become very dedicated to a cause, even more than men. \"One day she had never heard of the neo-Nazis, the next she was a terrorist.\" Lochte commented, \"One day she had no interest in the subject; the next she was 100 percent terrorist; she became a fighter overnight.\" ***Female Motivation for Terrorism*** What motivates women to become terrorists? Galvin suggests that women, being more idealistic than men, may be more impelled to perpetrate terrorist activities in response to failure to achieve change or the experience of death or injury to a loved one. Galvin also argues that the female terrorist enters into terrorism with different motivations and expectations than the male terrorist. In contrast to men, who Galvin characterizes as being enticed into terrorism by the promise of \"power and glory,\" females embark on terrorism \"attracted by promises of a better life for their children and the desire to meet people's needs that are not being met by an intractable establishment.\" Considering that females are less likely than males to have early experience with guns, terrorist membership is therefore a more active process for women than for men because women have more to learn. In the view of Susana Ronconi, one of Italy's most notorious and violent terrorists in the 1970s, the ability to commit violence did not have anything to do with gender. Rather, one's personality, background, and experience were far more important. Companionship is another motivating factor in a woman's joining a terrorist group. MacDonald points out that both Susanna Ronconi and Ulrike Meinhof \"craved love, comradeship, and emotional support\" from their comrades. Feminism has also been a motivating ideology for many female terrorists. Many of them have come from societies in which women are repressed, such as Middle Eastern countries and North Korea, or Catholic countries, such as in Latin America, Spain, Ireland, and Italy. Even Germany was repressive for women when the Baader-Meinhof Gang emerged. **CONCLUSION** **Terrorist Profiling** In profiling the terrorist, some generalizations can be made on the basis on this examination of the literature on the psychology and sociology of terrorism published over the past three decades. One finding is that, unfortunately for profiling purposes, there does not appear to be a single terrorist personality", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:61:8111780be6ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8615, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "Eastern countries and North Korea, or Catholic countries, such as in Latin America, Spain, Ireland, and Italy. Even Germany was repressive for women when the Baader-Meinhof Gang emerged. **CONCLUSION** **Terrorist Profiling** In profiling the terrorist, some generalizations can be made on the basis on this examination of the literature on the psychology and sociology of terrorism published over the past three decades. One finding is that, unfortunately for profiling purposes, there does not appear to be a single terrorist personality . This seems to be the consensus among terrorism psychologists as well as political scientists and sociologists. The personalities of terrorists may be as diverse as the personalities of people in any lawful profession. There do not appear to be any visibly detectable personality traits that would allow authorities to identify a terrorist. Another finding is that the terrorist is not diagnosably psychopathic or mentally sick. Contrary to the stereotype that the terrorist is a psychopath or otherwise mentally disturbed, the terrorist is actually quite sane, although deluded by an ideological or religious way of viewing the world. The only notable exceptions encountered in this study were the German anarchist terrorists, such as the Baader-Meinhof Gang and their affiliated groups. The German terrorists seem to be a special case, however, because of their inability to come to terms psychologically and emotionally with the shame of having parents who were either passive or active supporters of Hitler. The highly selective terrorist recruitment process explains why most terrorist groups have only a few pathological members. Candidates who exhibit signs of psychopathy or other mental illness are deselected in the interest of group survival. Terrorist groups need members whose behavior appears to be normal and who would not arouse suspicion. A member who exhibits traits of psychopathy or any noticeable degree of mental illness would only be a liability for the group, whatever his or her skills. That individual could not be depended on to carry out the assigned mission. On the contrary, such an individual would be more likely to sabotage the group by, for example, botching an operation or revealing group secrets if captured. Nor would a psychotic member be likely to enhance group solidarity. A former PKK spokesman has even stated publicly that the PKK's policy was to exclude psychopaths. This is not to deny, however, that certain psychological types of people may be attracted to terrorism. In his examination of autobiographies, court records, and rare interviews, Jerrold M. Post (1990:27) found that \"people with particular personality traits and tendencies are drawn disproportionately to terrorist careers.\" Authors such as Walter Laqueur, Post notes, \"have characterized terrorists as action-oriented, aggressive people who are stimulus-hungry and seek excitement.\" Even if Post and some other psychologists are correct that individuals with narcissistic personalities and low self-esteem are attracted to terrorism, the early psychological development of individuals in their pre-terrorist lives does not necessarily", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:62:210b8e223961", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8616, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "of autobiographies, court records, and rare interviews, Jerrold M. Post (1990:27) found that \"people with particular personality traits and tendencies are drawn disproportionately to terrorist careers.\" Authors such as Walter Laqueur, Post notes, \"have characterized terrorists as action-oriented, aggressive people who are stimulus-hungry and seek excitement.\" Even if Post and some other psychologists are correct that individuals with narcissistic personalities and low self-esteem are attracted to terrorism, the early psychological development of individuals in their pre-terrorist lives does not necessarily mean that terrorists are mentally disturbed and can be identified by any particular traits associated with their early psychological backgrounds. Many people in other high-risk professions, including law enforcement, could also be described as \"action-oriented, aggressive people who are stimulus-hungry and seek excitement.\" Post's views notwithstanding, there is actually substantial evidence that terrorists are quite sane. Although terrorist groups are highly selective in whom they recruit, it is not inconceivable that a psychopathic individual can be a top leader or *the* top leader of the terrorist group. In fact, the actions and behavior of the ANO's Abu Nidal, the PKK's Abdullah Ocalan, the LTTE's Velupillai Prabhakaran, the FARC's Jorge Briceño Suarez, and Aum Shinrikyo's Shoko Asahara might lead some to believe that they all share psychopathic or sociopathic symptoms. Nevertheless, the question of whether any or all of these guerrilla/terrorist leaders are psychopathic or sociopathic is best left for a qualified psychologist to determine. If the founder of a terrorist group or cult is a psychopath, there is little that the membership could do to remove him, without suffering retaliation. Thus, that leader may never have to be subjected to the group's standards of membership or leadership. In addition to having normal personalities and not being diagnosably mentally disturbed, a terrorist's other characteristics make him or her practically indistinguishable from normal people, at least in terms of outward appearance. Terrorist groups recruit members who have a normal or average physical appearance. As a result, the terrorist's physical appearance is unlikely to betray his or her identity as a terrorist, except in cases where the terrorist is well known, or security personnel already have a physical description or photo. A terrorist's physical features and dress naturally will vary depending on race, culture, and nationality. Both sexes are involved in a variety of roles, but men predominate in leadership roles. Terrorists tend to be in their twenties and to be healthy and strong; there are relatively few older terrorists, in part because terrorism is a physically demanding occupation. Training alone requires considerable physical fitness. Terrorist leaders are older, ranging from being in their thirties to their sixties. The younger terrorist who hijacks a jetliner, infiltrates a government building, lobs a grenade into a sidewalk café, attempts to assassinate a head of state, or detonates a body-bomb on a bus will likely be appropriately dressed and acting normal before initiating the attack. The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:63:2937270423f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8617, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "strong; there are relatively few older terrorists, in part because terrorism is a physically demanding occupation.

The younger terrorist who hijacks a jetliner, infiltrates a government building, lobs a grenade into a sidewalk café, attempts to assassinate a head of state, or detonates a body-bomb on a bus will likely be appropriately dressed and acting normal before initiating the attack. The terrorist needs to be inconspicuous in order to approach the target and then to escape after carrying out the attack, if escape is part of the plan. The suicide terrorist also needs to approach a target inconspicuously. This need to appear like a normal citizen would also apply to the FARC, the LTTE, the PKK, and other guerrilla organizations, whenever they use commandos to carry out urban terrorist operations. It should be noted that regular FARC, LTTE, and PKK members wear uniforms and operate in rural areas. These three groups do, however, also engage in occasional acts of urban terrorism, the LTTE more than the FARC and PKK. On those occasions, the LTTE and PKK terrorists wear civilian clothes. FARC guerrillas are more likely to wear uniforms when carrying out their acts of terrorism, such as kidnappings and murders, in small towns. Terrorist and guerrilla groups do not seem to be identified by any particular social background or educational level. They range from the highly educated and literate intellectuals of the 17 November Revolutionary Organization (17N) to the scientifically savvy \"ministers\" of the Aum Shinrikyo terrorist cult, to the peasant boys and girls forcibly inducted into the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK guerrilla organizations. Most terrorist leaders have tended to be well educated. Examples include Illich Ramrez Sanchez (\"The Jackal\") and the Shining Path's Abimael Guzman Reynoso, both of whom are currently in prison. Indeed, terrorists are increasingly well educated and capable of sophisticated, albeit highly biased, political analysis. In contrast to Abu Nidal, for example, who is a relatively uneducated leader of the old generation and one who appears to be motivated more by vengefulness and greed than any ideology, the new generation of Islamic terrorists, be they key operatives such as the imprisoned Ramzi Yousef, or leaders such as Osama bin Laden, are well educated and motivated by their religious ideologies. The religiously motivated terrorists are more dangerous than the politically motivated terrorists because they are the ones most likely to develop and use weapons of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in pursuit of their messianic or apocalyptic visions. The level of intelligence of a terrorist group's leaders may determine the longevity of the group. The fact that the 17 November group has operated successfully for a quarter century must be indicative of the intelligence of its leaders. In short, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:64:68336748d709", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8618, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "dangerous than the politically motivated terrorists because they are the ones most likely to develop and use weapons of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in pursuit of their messianic or apocalyptic visions. The level of intelligence of a terrorist group's leaders may determine the longevity of the group. The fact that the 17 November group has operated successfully for a quarter century must be indicative of the intelligence of its leaders. In short, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave like a normal person, such as a university student, until he or she executes the assigned mission. Therefore, considering that this physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal young person, terrorist profiling based on personality, physical, or sociological traits would not appear to be particularly useful. If terrorists cannot be detected by personality or physical traits, are there other early warning indicators that could alert security personnel? The most important indicator would be having intelligence information on the individual, such as a \"watch list,\" a description, and a photo, or at least a threat made by a terrorist group. Even a watch-list is not fool-proof, however, as demonstrated by the case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who, despite having peculiar features and despite being on a terrorist watch-list, passed through U.S. Customs unhindered. Unanticipated stress and nervousness may be a hazard of the profession, and a terrorist's nervousness could alert security personnel in instances where, for example, a hijacker is boarding an aircraft, or hostage-takers posing as visitors are infiltrating a government building. The terrorist undoubtedly has higher levels of stress than most people in lawful professions. However, most terrorists are trained to cope with nervousness. Female terrorists are known to be particularly cool under pressure. Leila Khaled and Kim Hyun Hee mention in their autobiographies how they kept their nervousness under control by reminding themselves of, and being totally convinced of, the importance of their missions. Indeed, because of their coolness under pressure, their obsessive dedication to the cause of their group, and their need to prove themselves to their male comrades, women make formidable terrorists and have proven to be more dangerous than male terrorists. Hizballah, the LTTE, and PKK are among the groups that have used attractive young women as suicide body-bombers to great effect. Suicide body-bombers are trained to be totally at ease and confident when approaching their target, although not all suicide terrorists are able to act normally in approaching their target. International terrorists generally appear to be predominately either leftist or Islamic. A profiling system could possibly narrow the statistical probability that an unknown individual boarding an airliner might be a terrorist if it could be accurately determined that most terrorists are of a certain race, culture, religion, or nationality.

A profiling system could possibly narrow the statistical probability that an unknown individual boarding an airliner might be a terrorist if it could be accurately determined that most terrorists are of a certain race, culture, religion, or nationality. In the absence of statistical data, however, it cannot be determined here whether members of any particular race, religion, or nationality are responsible for most acts of international terrorism. Until those figures become available, smaller-scale terrorist group profiles might be more useful. For example, a case could be made that U.S. Customs personnel should give extra scrutiny to the passports of young foreigners claiming to be \"students\" and meeting the following general description: physically fit males in their early twenties of Egyptian, Jordanian, Yemeni, Iraqi, Algerian, Syrian, or Sudanese nationality, or Arabs bearing valid British passports, in that order. These characteristics generally describe the core membership of Osama bin Laden's Arab \"Afghans\" (see Glossary), also known as the Armed Islamic Movement (AIM), who are being trained to attack the United States with WMD. **Terrorist Group Mindset Profiling** This review of the academic literature on terrorism suggests that the psychological approach by itself is insufficient in understanding what motivates terrorists, and that an interdisciplinary approach is needed to more adequately understand terrorist motivation. Terrorists are motivated not only by psychological factors but also very real political, social, religious, and economic factors, among others. These factors vary widely. Accordingly, the motivations, goals, and ideologies of ethnic separatist, anarchist, social revolutionary, religious fundamentalist, and new religious terrorist groups differ significantly. Therefore, each terrorist group must be examined within its own cultural, economic, political, and social context in order to better understand the motivations of its individual members and leaders and their particular ideologies. Although it may not be possible to isolate a so-called terrorist personality, each terrorist group has its own distinctive mindset. The mindset of a terrorist group reflects the personality and ideology of its top leader and other circumstantial traits, such as typology (religious, social revolutionary, separatist, anarchist, and so forth), a particular ideology or religion, culture, and nationality, as well as group dynamics. Jerrold Post dismisses the concept of a terrorist mindset on the basis that behavioral scientists have not succeeded in identifying it. Post confuses the issue, however, by treating the term \"mindset\" as a synonym for personality. The two terms are not synonymous. One's personality is a distinctive pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior that define one's way of interacting with the physical and social environment, whereas a mindset is a fixed mental attitude or a fixed state of mind. In trying to better define mindset, the term becomes more meaningful when considered within the context of a group.

In trying to better define mindset, the term becomes more meaningful when considered within the context of a group. The new terrorist recruit already has a personality when he or she joins the group, but the new member acquires the group's mindset only after being fully indoctrinated and familiarized with its ideology, point of view, leadership attitudes, ways of operating, and so forth. Each group will have its own distinctive mindset, which will be a reflection of the top leader's personality and ideology, as well as group type. For example, the basic mindset of a religious terrorist group, such as Hamas and Hizballah, is Islamic fundamentalism. The basic mindset of an Irish terrorist is anti-British sectarianism and separatism. The basic mindset of an ETA member is anti-Spanish separatism. The basic mindset of a 17 November member is antiestablishment, anti-US, anti-NATO, and anti-German nationalism and Marxism-Leninism. And the basic mindset of an Aum Shinrikyo member is worship of Shoko Asahara, paranoia against the Japanese and U.S. governments, and millenarian, messianic apocalypticism. Terrorist group mindsets determine how the group and its individual members view the world and how they lash out against it. Knowing the mindset of a group enables a terrorism analyst to better determine the likely targets of the group and its likely behavior under varying circumstances. It is surprising, therefore, that the concept of the terrorist mindset has not received more attention by terrorism specialists. It may not always be possible to profile the individual leaders of a terrorist group, as in the case of the 17 November Revolutionary Organization, but the group's mindset can be profiled if adequate information is available on the group and there is an established record of activities and pronouncements. Even though two groups may both have an Islamic fundamentalist mindset, their individual mindsets will vary because of their different circumstances. One cannot assume to have a basic understanding of the mindset of a terrorist group without having closely studied the group and its leader(s). Because terrorist groups are clandestine and shadowy, they are more difficult to analyze than guerrilla groups, which operate more openly, like paramilitary organizations. A terrorist group is usually much smaller than a guerrilla organization, but the former may pose a more lethal potential threat to U.S. security interests than the latter by pursuing an active policy of terrorist attacks against U.S. interests. A guerrilla group such as the FARC may kidnap or kill an occasional U.S. citizen or citizens as a result of unauthorized actions by a hard-line front commander, but a terrorist group such as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:67:b75ec839cd55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8621, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "which operate more openly, like paramilitary organizations.

A guerrilla group such as the FARC may kidnap or kill an occasional U.S. citizen or citizens as a result of unauthorized actions by a hard-line front commander, but a terrorist group such as the 17 November Revolutionary Organization does so as a matter of policy. Although Aum Shinrikyo, a dangerous cult, is on U.S. lists of terrorist groups and is widely feared in Japan, it still operates openly and legally, even though a number of its members have been arrested, some have received prison sentences, and others, including Shoko Asahara, have been undergoing trial. It can probably be safely assumed that Aum Shinrikyo will resume its terrorist activities, if not in Japan then elsewhere. Indeed, it appears to be reorganizing, and whatever new form in which this hydra-headed monster emerges is not likely to be any more pleasant than its former incarnation. The question is: what is Aum Shinrikyo planning to help bring about the apocalypse that it has been predicting for the new millennium? Knowing the mindset of a terrorist group would better enable the terrorism analyst to understand that organization's behavior patterns and the active or potential threat that it poses. Knowing the mindsets, including methods of operation, of terrorist groups would also aid in identifying what group likely perpetrated an unclaimed terrorist action and in predicting the likely actions of a particular group under various circumstances. Indeed, mindset profiling of a terrorist group is an essential mode of analysis for assessing the threat posed by the group. A terrorist group's mindset can be determined to a significant extent through a database analysis of selective features of the group and patterns in its record of terrorist attacks. A computer program could be designed to replicate the mindset of each terrorist group for this purpose. **Promoting Terrorist Group Schisms** All terrorist and guerrillas groups may be susceptible to psychological warfare aimed at dividing their political and military leaders and factions. Guerrilla organizations, however, should not be dealt with like terrorist groups. Although the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK engage in terrorism, they are primarily guerrilla organizations, and therefore their insurgencies and accompanying terrorism are likely to continue as long as there are no political solutions. In addition to addressing the root causes of a country's terrorist and insurgency problems, effective counterterrorist and counterinsurgency strategies should seek not only to divide a terrorist or guerrilla group's political and military factions but also to reduce the group's rural bases of support through rural development programs and establishment of civil patrols in each village or town.

Another effective counterterrorist strategy would be the identification and capture of a top hard-line terrorist or guerrilla leader, especially one who exhibits psychopathic characteristics. Removing the top hard-liners of a terrorist group would allow the group to reassess the policies pursued by its captured leader and possibly move in a less violent direction, especially if a more politically astute leader assumes control. This is what appears to be happening in the case of the PKK, which has opted for making peace since the capture of its ruthless, hard-line leader, Abdullah Ocalan. A government could simultaneously help members of urban terrorist groups to defect from their groups, for example through an amnesty program, as was done so effectively in Italy. A psychologically sophisticated policy of promoting divisions between political and military leaders as well as defections within guerrilla and terrorist groups is likely to be more effective than a simple military strategy based on the assumption that all members and leaders of the group are hard-liners. A military response to terrorism unaccompanied by political countermeasures is likely to promote cohesion within the group. The U.S. Government's focus on bin Laden as the nation's number one terrorist enemy has clearly raised his profile in the Islamic world and swelled the membership ranks of al-Qaida. Although not yet martyred, bin Laden has become the Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara of Islamic fundamentalism. As Post (1990:39) has explained: When the autonomous cell comes under external threat, the external danger has the consequence of reducing internal divisiveness and uniting the group against the outside enemy....Violent societal counteractions can transform a tiny band of insignificant persons into a major opponent of society, making their \"fantasy war,\" to use Ferracuti's apt term, a reality.\" **How Guerrilla and Terrorist Groups End** A counterterrorist policy should be tailor-made for a particular group, taking into account its historical, cultural, political, and social context, as well as the context of what is known about the psychology of the group or its leaders. The motivations of a terrorist group--both of its members and of its leaders--cannot be adequately understood outside its cultural, economic, political, and social context. Because terrorism is politically or religiously motivated, a counterterrorist policy, to be effective, should be designed to take into account political or religious factors. For example, terrorists were active in Chile during the military regime (1973-90), but counterterrorist operations by democratic governments in the 1990s have reduced them to insignificance. The transition from military rule", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:69:1bad5f06f59b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8623, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "leaders.

For example, terrorists were active in Chile during the military regime (1973-90), but counterterrorist operations by democratic governments in the 1990s have reduced them to insignificance. The transition from military rule to democratic government in Chile proved to be the most effective counterterrorist strategy. In contrast to relatively insignificant political terrorist groups in a number of countries, Islamic terrorist groups, aided by significant worldwide support among Muslim fundamentalists, remain the most serious terrorist threat to U.S. security interests. A U.S. counterterrorist policy, therefore, should avoid making leaders like Osama bin Laden heroes or martyrs for Muslims. To that end, the eye-for-an-eye Israeli policy of striking back for each act of terrorism may be highly counterproductive when applied by the world's only superpower against Islamic terrorism, as in the form of cruise-missile attacks against, or bombings of, suspected terrorist sites. Such actions, although politically popular at home, are seen by millions of Muslims as attacks against the Islamic religion and by people in many countries as superpower bullying and a violation of a country's sovereignty. U.S. counterterrorist military attacks against elusive terrorists may serve only to radicalize large sectors of the Muslim population and damage the U.S. image worldwide. Rather than retaliate against terrorists with bombs or cruise missiles, legal, political, diplomatic, financial, and psychological warfare measures may be more effective. Applying pressure to state sponsors may be especially effective. Cuba and Libya are two examples of terrorist state sponsors that apparently concluded that sponsoring terrorists was not in their national interests. Iran and Syria may still need to be convinced. Jeanne Knutson was critical of the reactive and ad hoc nature of U.S. counterterrorism policy, which at that time, in the early 1980s, was considered an entirely police and security task, as opposed to \"...a *politically* rational, comprehensive strategy to deal with *politically* motivated violence.\" She found this policy flawed because it dealt with symptoms instead of root causes and instead of eradicating the causes had increased the source of political violence. She charged that this policy routinely radicalized, splintered, and drove underground targeted U.S. groups, thereby only confirming the \"we-they\" split worldview of these groups. Unfortunately, too many governments still pursue purely military strategies to defeat political and religious extremist groups. Abroad, Knutson argued, the United States joined military and political alliances to support the eradication of internal dissident groups without any clear political rationale for such a stance. She emphasized that \"terrorists are individuals who commit crimes for *political* reasons,\" and for this reason \"the political system has better means to control and eliminate their activities and even to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:70:ace5fe52b1e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8624, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "split worldview of these groups.

She emphasized that \"terrorists are individuals who commit crimes for *political* reasons,\" and for this reason \"the political system has better means to control and eliminate their activities and even to attack their root causes than do the police and security forces working alone.\" Thus, she considered it politically and socially unwise to give various national security agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the political role of choosing targets of political violence. She advocated \"a necessary stance of neutrality toward national dissident causes--whether the causes involve the territory of historical friend or foe.\" She cited the neutral U.S. stance toward the Irish Republican Army (IRA) as a case study of how to avoid anti-U.S. terrorism. Her views still seem quite relevant. Goals of a long-range counterterrorism policy should also include deterring alienated youth from joining a terrorist group in the first place. This may seem an impractical goal, for how does one recognize a potential terrorist, let alone deter him or her from joining a terrorist group? Actually, this is not so impractical in the cases of guerrilla organizations like the FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK, which conscript all the young people in their rural areas of operation who can be rounded up. A counter strategy could be approached within the framework of advertising and civic-action campaigns. A U.S. government-sponsored mass media propaganda campaign undertaken in the Colombian countryside, the Kurdish enclaves, and the Vanni region of Sri Lanka and tailor-made to fit the local culture and society probably could help to discredit hard-liners in the guerrilla/terrorist groups sufficiently to have a serious negative impact on their recruitment efforts. Not only should all young people in the region be educated on the realities of guerrilla life, but a counterterrorist policy should be in place to inhibit them from joining in the first place. If they are inducted, they should be helped or encouraged to leave the group. The effectiveness of such a campaign would depend in part on how sensitive the campaign is culturally, socially, politically, and economically. It could not succeed, however, without being supplemented by civic-action and rural security programs, especially a program to establish armed self-defense civil patrols among the peasantry. The Peruvian government was able to defeat terrorists operating in the countryside only by creating armed self-defense civil patrols that became its eyes and ears. These patrols not only provided crucial intelligence on the movements of the Shining Path and Tupac Amaru terrorists, but also enabled the rural population to take a stand against them.

These patrols not only provided crucial intelligence on the movements of the Shining Path and Tupac Amaru terrorists, but also enabled the rural population to take a stand against them. There is little evidence that direct government intervention is the major factor in the decline of terrorist groups. Clearly, it was an important factor in certain cases, such as the RAF and with various urban Marxist-Leninist group in Latin America where massive governmental repression was applied (but at unacceptably high cost in human rights abuses). Social and psychological factors may be more important. If, for security reasons, a terrorist group becomes too isolated from the population, as in the case of the RAF and the Uruguayan Tupamaros, the group is prone to losing touch with any base of support that it may have had. Without a measure of popular support, a terrorist group cannot survive. Moreover, if it fails to recruit new members to renew itself by supporting or replacing an aging membership or members who have been killed or captured, it is likely to disintegrate. The terrorist groups that have been active for many years have a significant base of popular support. Taylor and Qualye point out that despite its atrocious terrorist violence, the Provisional IRA in 1994 continued to enjoy the electoral support of between 50,000 and 70,000 people in Northern Ireland. The FARC, the LTTE, and the PKK continue to have strong popular support within their own traditional bases of support. In the cases of West German and Italian terrorism, counterterrorist operations undoubtedly had a significant impact on terrorist groups. Allowing terrorists an exit can weaken the group. For example, amnesty programs, such as those offered by the Italian government, can help influence terrorists to defect. Reducing support for the group on the local and national levels may also contribute to reducing the group's recruitment pool. Maxwell Taylor and Ethel Quayle have pointed out that penal policies in both countries, such as allowing convicted terrorists reduced sentences and other concessions, even including daytime furloughs from prison to hold a normal job, had a significant impact in affecting the long-term reduction in terrorist violence. Referring to Italy's 1982 Penitence Law, Taylor and Quayle explain that \"This law effectively depenalized serious terrorist crime through offering incentives to terrorists to accept their defeat, admit their guilt and inform on others so that the dangers of terrorist violence could be diminished.\" Similarly, Article 57 of the German Penal Code offers the possibility of reduction of sentence or suspension or deferment of sentence when convicted terrorists renounce terrorism.

Former terrorists do not have to renounce their ideological convictions, only their violent methods. To be sure, these legal provisions have not appealed to hard-core terrorists, as evidenced by the apparent reactivation of the Italian Red Brigades in 1999. Nevertheless, for countries with long-running insurgencies, such as Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Turkey, amnesty programs for guerrillas are very important tools for resolving their internal wars. With regard to guerrilla/terrorist organizations, a major question is how to encourage the political wing to constrain the military wing, or how to discredit or neutralize the military branch. The PKK should serve as an ongoing case study in this regard. Turkey, by its policy of demonizing the PKK and repressing the Kurdish population in its efforts to combat it instead of seeking a political solution, only raised the PKK's status in the eyes of the public and lost the hearts and minds of its Kurdish population. Nevertheless, by capturing Ocalan and by refraining thus far from making him a martyr by hanging him, the Turkish government has inadvertently allowed the PKK to move in a more political direction as advocated by its political leaders, who now have a greater voice in decision-making. Thus, the PKK has retreated from Turkey and indicated an interest in pursuing a political as opposed to a military strategy. This is how a guerrilla/terrorist organization should end, by becoming a political party, just as the M-19 did in Colombia and the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) did in El Salvador. **APPENDIX** **SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES: CASE STUDIES** **Exemplars of International Terrorism in the Early 1970s** ***Renato Curcio*** **Significance:** Imprisoned leader of the Italian Red Brigades. **Background:** The background of Renato Curcio, the imprisoned former main leader of the first-generation Red Brigades (Brigata Rosse), provides some insight into how a university student became Italy's most wanted terrorist. The product of an extramarital affair between Renato Zampa (brother of film director Luigi Zampa) and Yolanda Curcio, Renato Curcio was born near Rome on September 23, 1941. His early years were a difficult time for him and his mother, a housemaid, whose itinerant positions with families required long separations. In April 1945, Curcio's beloved uncle, Armando, a Fiat auto worker, was murdered in a Fascist ambush. A poor student, Curcio failed several subjects in his first year of high school and had to repeat the year. He then resumed vocational training classes until moving to Milan to live with his mother.

A poor student, Curcio failed several subjects in his first year of high school and had to repeat the year. He then resumed vocational training classes until moving to Milan to live with his mother. He enrolled in the Ferrini Institute in Albenga, where he became a model student. On completing his degree in 1962, he won a scholarship to study at the new and innovative Institute of Sociology at the University of Trento, where he became absorbed in existential philosophy. During the mid-1960s, he gravitated toward radical politics and Marxism as a byproduct of his interest in existentialism and the self. By the late 1960s, he had become a committed revolutionary and Marxist theoretician. According to Alessandro Silj, three political events transformed him from a radical to an activist and ultimately a political terrorist: two bloody demonstrations at Trento and a massacre by police of farm laborers in 1968. During the 1967-69 period, Curcio was also involved in two Marxist university groups: the Movement for a Negative University and the publication *Lavoro Politico* (Political Work). Embittered by his expulsion from the radical Red Line faction of *Lavoro Politico* in August 1969, Curcio decided to drop out of Trento and forego his degree, even though he already had passed his final examinations. Prior to transferring his bases of activities to Milan, Curcio married, in a Catholic ceremony, Margherita (Mara) Cagol, a Trentine sociology major, fellow radical, and daughter of a prosperous Trento merchant. In Milan Curcio became a full-fledged terrorist. The Red Brigades was formed in the second half of 1970 as a result of the merger of Curcio's Proletarian Left and a radical student and worker group. After getting arrested in February 1971 for occupying a vacant house, the Curcios and the most militant members of the Proletarian Left went completely underground and organized the Red Brigades and spent the next three years, from 1972 to 1975, engaging in a series of bombings and kidnappings of prominent figures. Curcio was captured but freed by Margherita in a raid on the prison five months later. Three weeks after the dramatic prison escape, Margherita was killed in a shootout with the Carabinieri. Curcio was again captured in January 1976, tried, and convicted, and he is still serving a 31-year prison sentence for terrorist activities. An insight into Curcio's (1973:72) motivation for becoming a terrorist can be found in a letter to his mother written during his initial prison confinement: Yolanda dearest, mother mine, years have passed since the day on which I set out to encounter life and left you alone to deal with life.

My enemies are the enemies of humanity and of intelligence, those who have built and build their accursed fortunes on the material and intellectual misery of the people.

But I am not merely an \"idealist\" and it is not enough for me to have, as is said, \"a good conscience.\" For this reason I will continue to fight for communism even from the depths of a prison. ***Leila Khaled*** **Position*****:*** First Secretary of the PFLP's Palestinian Popular Women's Committees (PPWC). **Background:** Khaled was born on April 13, 1948, in Haifa, Palestine. She left Haifa at age four when her family fled the Israeli occupation and lived in impoverished exile in a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) refugee camp in Sour, Lebanon. By age eight, she had become politically aware of the Palestinian plight. Inspired by a Palestinian revolutionary of the 1930s, Izz Edeen Kassam, she decided to become a revolutionary \"in order to liberate my people and myself.\" The years 1956-59 were her period of political apprenticeship as an activist of the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM). By the summer of 1962, she was struggling to cope with national, social, class, and sexual oppression but, thanks to her brother's financial support, finally succeeded in attending the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1962-63, where she scored the second highest average on the AUB entrance exam. While an AUB student, Khaled received what she refers to as her \"real education\" in the lecture hall of the Arab Cultural Club (ACC) and in the ranks of the ANM and the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS). Her \"intellectual companion\"at AUB was her American roommate, with whom she would have heated political arguments.

For lack of funding, she was unable to continue her education after passing her freshman year in the spring of 1963. In September 1963, Khaled departed for Kuwait, where she obtained a teaching position. After a run-in with the school's principal, who called her to task for her political activities on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), she returned to Lebanon in late June 1964. She returned to the school in Kuwait that fall but was demoted to elementary teaching. The U.S. invasions of the Dominican Republic and Vietnam in 1965 solidified her hatred of the U.S. Government. The death of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara on October 9, 1967, convinced her to join the revolution. When Fatah renewed its military operations on August 18, 1967, Khaled attempted to work through Fatah's fund-raising activities in Kuwait to liberate Palestine. She pleaded with Yasir Arafat's brother, Fathi Arafat, to be allowed to join Al-Assifah, Fatah's military wing. She found an alternative to Fatah, however, when the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked an El-Al airplane in July 1968, an action that inspired her to seek contacts with the PFLP in Kuwait. She succeeded when PFLP representative Abu Nidal, whom she described as \"a tall, handsome young man\" who was \"reserved and courteous,\" met her in a Kuwaiti bookstore. After performing fund-raising for the PFLP, she was allowed to join its Special Operations Squad and underwent intensive training. In her first mission, she hijacked a TWA plane on a flight from Rome to Athens on August 29, 1969, and diverted it to Damascus, where all 113 passengers were released unharmed. Although her identity was revealed to the world by the Syrians, she continued her terrorist career by training to commandeer an El-Al plane. When Jordan's King Hussein launched a military offensive against the Palestinian resistance in Amman in February 1970, Khaled fought in the streets alongside PFLP comrades. That March, in preparation for another hijacking, she left Amman and underwent at least three secret plastic surgery operations over five months by a well-known but very reluctant plastic surgeon in Beirut. While Khaled was discussing strategy with Dr. Wadi Haddad in his Beirut apartment on July 11, 1970, the apartment was hit by two rockets in the first Israeli attack inside Lebanon, injuring the man's wife and child.

On September 6, 1970, Khaled and an accomplice attempted to hijack an El-Al flight from Amsterdam with 12 armed security guards aboard but were overpowered. He was shot to death, but she survived and was detained in London by British police. After 28 days in detention, she was released in a swap for hostages from hijacked planes and escorted on a flight to Cairo and then, on October 12, to Damascus. Following her release, Khaled went to Beirut and joined a combat unit. In between fighting, she would tour refugee camps and recruit women. She married an Iraqi PFLP member, Bassim, on November 26, 1970, but the marriage was short-lived. She returned to the same Beirut plastic surgeon and had her former face mostly restored. She barely escaped a bed-bomb apparently planted by the Mossad, but her sister was shot dead on Christmas Day 1976. After fading from public view, she surfaced again in 1980, leading a PLO delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women conference in Copenhagen. She attended university in Russia for two years in the early 1980s, but the PFLP ordered her to return to combat in Lebanon before she had completed her studies. Khaled married a PFLP physician in 1982. She was elected first secretary of the Palestinian Popular Women's Committees (PPWC) in 1986. At the beginning of the 1990s, when she was interviewed by Eileen MacDonald, she was living in the Yarmuk refugee camp in Damascus, still serving as PPWC first secretary and \"immediately recognizable as the young Leila.\" Since then, Khaled has been living in Amman, Jordan, where she works as a teacher, although still a PFLP member. She was allowed by Israel briefly to enter Palestinian-ruled areas in the West Bank, or at least the Gaza Strip, in February 1996, to vote on amending the Palestinian charter to remove its call for Israel's destruction. She was on a list of 154 members of the Palestine National Council (PNC), an exile-based parliament, who Israel approved for entrance into the Gaza Strip. Khaled said she had renounced terrorism. However, she declined an invitation to attend a meeting in Gaza with President Clinton in December 1998 at which members of the PNC renounced portions of the PLO charter calling for the destruction of Israel. \"We are not going to change our identity or our history,\" she explained to news media. ***Kozo Okamoto*** **Significance:** The sole surviving Rengo Sekigun (Japanese Red Army) terrorist of the PFLP's Lod (Tel Aviv) Airport massacre of May 30, 1972, who remains active. **Background:** Kozo Okamoto was born in southwestern", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:77:e97ee4751ce1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8631, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "to attend a meeting in Gaza with President Clinton in December 1998 at which members of the PNC renounced portions of the PLO charter calling for the destruction of Israel. \"We are not going to change our identity or our history,\" she explained to news media. ***Kozo Okamoto*** **Significance:** The sole surviving Rengo Sekigun (Japanese Red Army) terrorist of the PFLP's Lod (Tel Aviv) Airport massacre of May 30, 1972, who remains active. **Background:** Kozo Okamoto was born in southwestern Japan in 1948. He was the youngest of six children, the son of a retired elementary school principal married to a social worker. The family was reportedly very close when the children were young. His mother died of cancer in 1966, and his father remarried. He is not known to have had a disturbed or unusual childhood. On the contrary, he apparently had a normal and happy childhood. He achieved moderate success at reputable high schools in Kagoshima. However, he failed to qualify for admission at Kyoto University and had to settle for the Faculty of Agriculture at Japan's Kagoshima University, where his grades were mediocre. While a university student, he was not known to be politically active in extremist groups or demonstrations, although he belonged to a student movement and a peace group and became actively concerned with environmental issues. However, Okamoto's older brother, Takeshi, a former student at Kyoto University, introduced him to representatives of the newly formed JRA in Tokyo in early 1970. Soon thereafter, Takeshi participated in the hijacking of a Japan Air Lines jet to Korea. Takeshi's involvement in that action compelled his father to resign his job. Although Kozo had promised his father that he would not follow in his brother's footsteps, Kozo became increasingly involved in carrying out minor tasks for the JRA. Kozo Okamoto was attracted to the JRA more for its action-oriented program than for ideological reasons. (AP Photo courtesy of *www.washingtonpost.com)* **Kozo Okamoto** (presumably on right) with three other captured PFLP comrades, 1997. In late February 1972, Okamoto traveled to Beirut, where the JRA said he could meet his brother, and then underwent seven weeks of terrorist training by PFLP personnel in Baalbek. After he and his comrades traveled through Europe posing as tourists, they boarded a flight to Lod Airport on May 30, 1972. Unable to commit suicide as planned following the Lod Airport massacre, Okamoto was captured and made a full confession only after being promised that he would be allowed to kill himself. During his trial, he freely admitted his act and demonstrated no remorse; he viewed himself as a soldier rather than a terrorist, and to him Lod Airport was a military base in a war zone.

To be sure, Okamoto's courtroom speech, including his justification for slaughtering innocent people and his stated hope that he and his two dead comrades would become, in death, \"three stars of Orion,\" was rather bizarre. By 1975, while in solitary confinement, Okamoto began identifying himself to visitors as a Christian. When his sanity began to deteriorate in 1985, he was moved to a communal cell. That May, he was released as a result of an exchange of Palestinian prisoners for three Israeli soldiers, under a swap conducted by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command (PFLP-GC) . He arrived to a hero's welcome in Libya on May 20, and was met by JRA leader Fusako Shigenobu. He apparently has continued to operate with the PFLP-GC. On February 15, 1997, he and five JRA comrades were arrested in Lebanon and accused of working with the PFLP-GC and training PFLP-GC cadres in the Bekaa Valley outside Baalbek. According to another report, they were arrested in a Beirut apartment. That August, he and four of his comrades were sentenced to three years in jail (minus time already served and deportation to an undisclosed location) for entering the country with forged passports. **Exemplars of International Terrorism in the Early 1990s** ***Mahmud Abouhalima*** **Significance:** World Trade Center bomber. **Background:** Mahmud Abouhalima was born in a ramshackle industrial suburb 15 miles south of Alexandria in 1959, the first of four sons of a poor but stern millman, a powerful weight lifter. Mahmud was known as an ordinary, well-rounded, cheerful youth who found comfort in religion. He prayed hard and shunned alcohol. He studied education at Alexandria University and played soccer in his spare time. He developed a deep and growing hatred for Egypt because of his belief that the country offered little hope for his generation's future. As a teenager, he began to hang around with members of an outlawed Islamic Group (al-Jama al-Islamiyya), headed by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. In 1981 Abouhalima quit school and left Egypt. He reportedly fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan. In September 1991, now an Afghan veteran, he was granted a tourist visa to visit Germany. In Munich he sought political asylum, claiming that he faced persecution in Egypt because of his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun). He subsequently made his way to the United States and worked as a taxi driver in Brooklyn, New York. He also allegedly ran a phony coupon-redemption scam.

He subsequently made his way to the United States and worked as a taxi driver in Brooklyn, New York. He also allegedly ran a phony coupon-redemption scam. This operation and a similar one run by Zein Isa, a member of the ANO in St. Louis, supposedly funneled about $200 million of the annual $400 million in fraudulent coupon losses allegedly suffered by the industry back to the Middle East to fund terrorist activities, although the figure seems a bit high. On February 26, 1993, the day of the WTC bombing, he was seen by several witnesses with Mohammed A. Salameh at the Jersey City storage facility. Tall and red-haired, Abouhalima (\"Mahmud the Red\"), 33, was captured in his native Egypt not long after the bombing. He was \"hands-on ringleader\" and the motorist who drove a getaway car. He is alleged to have planned the WTC bombing and trained his co-conspirators in bomb-testing. He was sentenced to 240 years in federal prison. ***Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman*** **Significance:** World Trade Center bombing co-conspirator. **Background:**Omar Abdel Rahman was born in 1938, blinded by diabetes as an infant. He became a religious scholar in Islamic law at Cairo's al-Azhar University. By the 1960s, he had become increasingly critical of Egypt's government and its institutions, including al-Azhar University, which he blamed for failing to uphold true Islamic law. One of the defendants accused of assassinating Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on October 6, 1981, Dr. Abdel Rahman was considered an accessory because of his authorization of the assassination through the issuance of a fatwa or Islamic judicial decree, to the assassins. However, he was acquitted because of the ambiguity of his role. In the 1980s, made unwelcome by the Egyptian government, he traveled to Afghanistan, Britain, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Switzerland, and the United States, exhorting young Muslims to join the mujahideen to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Sheikh Abdel Rahman's activities also included leading a puritanical Islamic fundamentalist movement (Al Jamaa al Islamiyya) aimed at overthrowing the regime of President Hosni Mubarak. The movement's methods included terrorist attacks against foreign tourists visiting archaeological sites in Egypt. The sheik has described American and other Western tourists in Egypt as part of a \"plague\" on his country. **Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman** (Photo courtesy of *Middle East Intelligence Bulletin*, Vol. 3, No. 6, June 2001) In 1990, after a brief visit back to Egypt, Abdel Rahman fled to Sudan.

Later that year, the blind cleric, despite being on the U.S. official list of terrorists, succeeded in entering the United States with a tourist visa obtained at the U.S. Embassy in Sudan. He became the prayer leader of the small El Salem Mosque in Jersey City, New Jersey, where many of the WTC bombing conspirators attended services. He preached violence against the United States and pro-Western governments in the Middle East. Abdel Rahman maintained direct ties with mujahideen fighters and directly aided terrorist groups in Egypt, to whom he would send messages on audiotape. He served as spiritual mentor of El Sayyid A. Nosair, who assassinated Jewish Defense League founder Rabbi Meir Kahane on November 5, 1990. (Nosair, whose conviction was upheld by a Federal appeals court panel on August 16, 1999, knew many members of the WTC bombing group and was visited by some of them in jail.) Following the WTC bombing on February 26, 1993, Abdel Rahman was implicated in that conspiracy as well as in a plot to bomb other public places in New York, including the Holland and Lincoln tunnels and the United Nations building. He was also implicated in a plot to assassinate U.S. Senator Alfonse d'Amato (R., N.Y.) and United Nations Secretary General Boutros-Ghali. Abdel Rahman and seven others were arrested in connection with this plot in June 1993. In a 1994 retrial of 1981 riot cases in Egypt, Abdel Rahman was convicted in absentia and sentenced to seven years in prison. On October 1, 1995, Sheikh Abdel Rahman and nine other Islamic fundamentalists were convicted in a federal court in New York of conspiracy to destroy U.S. public buildings and structures. Abdel Rahman was convicted of directing the conspiracy and, under a joint arrangement with Egypt, of attempting to assassinate Mubarak. His conviction and those of his co-conspirators were upheld on August 16, 1999. Despite his imprisonment, at least two Egyptian terrorist groups--Islamic Group (Gamaa Islamiya) and al-Jihad (see al-Jihad)--continue to regard him as their spiritual leader. The Gamaa terrorists who massacred 58 tourists near Luxor, Egypt, in November 1997 claimed the attack was a failed hostage takeover intended to force the United States into releasing Abdel Rahman. He is currently serving a life sentence at a federal prison in New York. ***Mohammed A. Salameh*** **Significance:** A World Trade Center bomber. **Background:** Mohammed A. Salameh was born near Nablus, an Arab town on the West Bank, on September 1, 1967.

In his final years in high school, Salameh, according to his brother, \"became religious, started to pray and read the Koran with other friends in high school. He stopped most of his past activities and hobbies....He was not a fundamentalist. He was interested in Islamic teachings.\" According to another source, Salameh comes from a long line of guerrilla fighters on his mother's side. His maternal grandfather fought in the 1936 Arab revolt against British rule in Palestine, and even as an old man joined the PLO and was jailed by the Israelis. A maternal uncle was arrested in 1968 for \"terrorism\" and served 18 years in an Israeli prison before he was released and deported, making his way to Baghdad, where he became number two in the \"Western Sector,\" a PLO terrorist unit under Iraqi influence. Mohammed Salameh earned a degree from the Islamic studies faculty of the University of Jordan. His family went into debt to buy him an airline ticket to the United States, where he wanted to obtain an MBA. Salameh entered the United States on February 17, 1988, on a six-month tourist visa, and apparently lived in Jersey City illegally for the next five years. He apparently belonged to the Masjid al-Salam Mosque in Jersey City, whose preachers included fundamentalist Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. Slight and bearded, naive and manipulable, Salameh was arrested in the process of returning to collect the deposit on the van that he had rented to carry the Trade Center bombing materials. On March 4, 1993, Salameh, 26, was charged by the FBI with \"aiding and abetting\" the WTC bombing on February 26, 1993. He is also believed to be part of the group that stored the explosive material in a Jersey City storage locker. ***Ahmed Ramzi Yousef*** **Significance:** Mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing. **Background:** Yousef, whose real name is Abd-al-Basit Balushi, was born either on May 20, 1967, or April 27, 1968, in Kuwait, where he grew up and completed high school. His Pakistani father is believed to have been an engineer with Kuwaiti Airlines for many years. Yousef is Palestinian on his mother's side; his grandmother is Palestinian. He considers himself Palestinian. In 1989 Yousef graduated from Britain's Swansea University with a degree in engineering. Yousef is believed to have trained and fought in the Afghan War. He and bin Laden reportedly were linked at least as long ago as 1989. In that year, Yousef went to the Philippines and introduced himself as an emissary of Osama bin Laden, sent to support that country's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:82:dc4659794bc8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8636, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "for many years.

In that year, Yousef went to the Philippines and introduced himself as an emissary of Osama bin Laden, sent to support that country's radical Islamic movement, specifically the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf group. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Yousef was known as a collaborator. After disappearing in Kuwait in 1991, he is next known to have reappeared in the Philippines in December 1991, accompanied by a Libyan missionary named Mohammed abu Bakr, the leader of the Mullah Forces in Libya. Yousef stayed for three months providing training to Abu Sayyaf guerrillas in the southern Philippines. When he arrived from Pakistan at John F. Kennedy Airport on September 1, 1992, without a visa, Yousef, who was carrying an Iraqi passport, applied for political asylum. Often described as slender, Yousef is six feet tall, weighs 180 pounds, and is considered white, with an olive complexion. He was sometimes clean shaven, but wears a beard in his FBI wanted poster. Despite his itinerant life as an international terrorist, Yousef is married and has two daughters. A Palestinian friend and fellow terrorist, Ahmad Ajaj, who was traveling with Yousef on September 1, 1992, although apparently at a safe distance, was detained by passport control officers at John F. Kennedy Airport for carrying a false Swedish passport. Ajaj was carrying papers containing formulas for bomb-making material, which prosecutors said were to be used to destroy bridges and tunnels in New York. **Ahmed Ramzi Yousef** (Photo courtesy of *www.terrorismfiles.org/individuals/ramzi_yousef.html/* ) Yousef was allowed to stay in the United States while his political asylum case was considered. U.S. immigration officials apparently accepted his false claim that he was a victim of the Gulf War who had been beaten by Iraqi soldiers because the Iraqis suspected that he had worked for Kuwaiti resistance. Yousef moved into an apartment in Jersey City with roommate Mohammad Salameh (*q.v.*). After participating in the Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993, Yousef, then 25 or 26 years old, returned to Manila, the Philippines, that same day. In Manila, he plotted \"Project Bojinka,\" a plan to plant bombs aboard U.S. passenger airliners in 1995, using a virtually undetectable bomb that he had created. He was skilled in the art of converting Casio digital watches into timing switches that use light bulb filaments to ignite cotton soaked in nitroglycerine explosive.

He carried out a practice run on a Philippine Airlines Flight 434 bound for Tokyo on December 9, 1994. A wearer of contact lenses, Yousef concealed the nitroglycerin compound in a bottle normally used to hold saline solution. His bomb killed a Japanese tourist seated near the explosive, which he left taped under a seat, and wounded 10 others. In March 1993, prosecutors in Manhattan indicted Yousef for his role in the WTC bombing. On January 6, 1995, Manila police raided Yousef's room overlooking Pope John Paul II's motorcade route into the city. Yousef had fled the room after accidentally starting a fire while mixing chemicals. Police found explosives, a map of the Pope's route, clerical robes, and a computer disk describing the plot against the Pope, as well as planned attacks against U.S. airlines. Yousef's fingerprints were on the material, but he had vanished, along with his girlfriend, Carol Santiago. Also found in his room was a letter threatening Filipino interests if a comrade held in custody were not released. It claimed the \"ability to make and use chemicals and poisonous gas... for use against vital institutions and residential populations and the sources of drinking water.\" Yousef's foiled plot involved blowing up eleven U.S. commercial aircraft in midair. The bombs were to be made of a stable, liquid form of nitroglycerin designed to pass through airport metal detectors. For most of the three years before his capture in early 1995, Yousef reportedly resided at the bin Laden-financed Bayt Ashuhada (House of Martyrs) guest house in Peshawar, Pakistan. On February 8, 1995, local authorities arrested Yousef in Islamabad in the Su Casa guest house, also owned by a member of the bin Laden family. Yousef had in his possession the outline of an even greater international terrorist campaign that he was planning, as well as bomb-making products, including two toy cars packed with explosives and flight schedules for United and Delta Airlines. His plans included using a suicide pilot (Said Akhman) to crash a light aircraft filled with powerful explosives into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, as well as blowing up 11 U.S. airliners simultaneously as they approached U.S. airports. He was then turned over to the FBI and deported to the United States. On June 21, 1995, Yousef told federal agents that he had planned and executed the WTC bombing. On September 6, 1996, Yousef was convicted in a New York Federal District Court for trying to bomb U.S. airliners in Asia in 1995. On January 8, 1998, he was sentenced to 240 years in prison.

He has remained incarcerated in the new \"supermax\" prison in Florence, Colorado. His cellmates in adjoining cells in the \"Bomber Wing\" include Timothy McVeigh, the right-wing terrorist who blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, and Ted Kaczynski, the sociopathic loner known as the Unabomber. The polyglot Yousef has discussed languages with Kaczynski, who speaks Spanish, French, and German, and taught him some Turkish. **Ethnic Separatist Groups** ***Irish Terrorists*** According to a middle-level IRA officer interviewed by *Newsweek* in 1988, the IRA has plenty of recruits. Each potential enlistee is kept under scrutiny for as long as a year before being allowed to sign up. The Provos are paranoid about informers, so hard drinkers and loudmouths are automatically disqualified from consideration. H.A. Lyons, a Belfast psychiatrist who frequently works with prisoners, told *Newsweek* that the IRA's political murderers are \"fairly normal individuals,\" compared with nonpolitical killers. \"They regard themselves as freedom fighters,\"adding that they feel no remorse for their actions, at least against security forces. As the IRA officer explained to *Newsweek*: The killing of innocent civilians is a thing that sickens all volunteers, and it must and will stop. But I can live with the killing [of security forces]. There is an occupying army which has taken over our country. I see no difference between the IRA and World War II resistance movements. Rona M. Fields noted in 1976 that Belfast \"terrorists\" are most often adolescent youths from working-class families. By the 1990s, however, that appeared to have changed. According to the profile of Irish terrorists, loyalist and republican, developed by Maxwell Taylor and Ethel Quayle (1994), \"The person involved in violent action is likely to be up to 30 years old, or perhaps a little older and usually male.\" Republican and loyalist leaders tend to be somewhat older. The terrorist is invariably from a working class background, not because of some Marxist doctrine but because the loyalist and republican areas of Northern Ireland are primarily working class. Quite likely, he is unemployed. \"He is either living in the area in which he was born, or has recently left it for operational reasons.\" His education is probably limited, because he probably left school at age 15 or 16 without formal qualifications.

Although not a technically proficient specialist, he is likely to have received weapons or explosives training. The profile notes that the recruits are often well dressed, or at least appropriately dressed, and easily blend into the community. \"Northern Ireland terrorists are frequently articulate and give the impression of being worldly,\" it states. At the psychological level, Taylor found \"a lack of signs of psychopathology, at least in any overt clinical sense\" among the members. Irish terrorists can easily justify their violent actions \"in terms of their own perception of the world,\" and do not even object to being called terrorists, although they refer to each other as volunteers or members. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) is generally a homegrown, grassroots organization. In the late 1980s, some members of the PIRA were as young as 12 years of age, but most of those taking part in PIRA operations were in the twenties. Front-line bombers and shooters were younger, better educated, and better trained than the early members were. The PIRA recruits members from the streets. ***Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Abdullah Ocalan*** **Group/Leader Profile:** The Kurdistan Workers' Party (Parte Krikaranc Kordesian/Partia Karkaris Kurdistan-PKK) originated in 1972 with a small group of Marxist-oriented university activists in Ankara known as \"Apocus.\" The principal founder of the student-based Apocular group, Abdullah Ocalan (\"Apo\"--Uncle) was a former student (expelled) in political science at Ankara University, who was prominent in the underground Turkish Communist Party. Ocalan (pronounced Oh-ja-lan or URGE'ah-lohn) was born in 1948 in the village of Omerli in the southeastern Turkish province of Urfa, the son of an impoverished Kurdish farmer and a Turkish mother. In 1974 Apocus formed a university association whose initial focus was on gaining official recognition for Kurdish language and cultural rights. Over the next four years, Ocalan organized the association into the PKK while studying revolutionary theories. In 1978 he formally established the PKK, a clandestine Marxist-Leninist Kurdish political party. During his trial in June 1999, Ocalan blamed harsh Turkish laws for spawning the PKK in 1978, and then for its taking up arms in 1984. \"These kinds of laws give birth to rebellion and anarchy,\" he said. The language ban--now eased--\"provokes this revolt.\" **Abdullah Ocalan** (Photo courtesy of CNN.com, Time.com) Several of the founders of the PKK were ethnic Turks.

The language ban--now eased--\"provokes this revolt.\" **Abdullah Ocalan** (Photo courtesy of CNN.com, Time.com) Several of the founders of the PKK were ethnic Turks. One of the eleven founders of the PKK was Kesire Yildirim, the only female member. She later married Ocalan, but they became estranged when she began questioning his policies and tactics. (She left him in 1988 to join a PKK breakaway faction in Europe.) Unlike other Kurdish groups in the Middle East, the PKK advocated the establishment of a totally independent Kurdish Marxist republic, Kurdistan, to be located in southeastern Turkey. In about 1978, influenced by Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory, Ocalan decided to leave the cities and establish the PKK in rural areas. He fled Turkey before the 1980 military coup and lived in exile, mostly in Damascus and in the Lebanese plains under Syrian control, where he set up his PKK headquarters and training camps. In 1983 he recruited and trained at least 100 field commandos in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, where the PKK maintains its Masoum Korkmaz guerrilla training base and headquarters. The PKK's army, the People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan (ARGK), began operating in August 1984. The PKK created the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) in 1985 to bolster its recruitment, intelligence, and propaganda activities. The PKK's early radical agenda, including its antireligious rhetoric and violence, alienated the PKK from much of the Kurdish peasantry. Citing various sources, Kurdish specialist Martin van Bruinessen reports that although the PKK had won little popular sympathy by the early 1990s with its brutally violent actions, \"It gradually came to enjoy the grudging admiration of many Kurds, both for the prowess and recklessness of its guerrilla fighters and for the courage with which its arrested partisans stood up in court and in prison.... By the end of 1990, it enjoyed unprecedented popularity in eastern Turkey, although few seemed to actively support it.\" Ocalan is reportedly regarded by many Kurds as a heroic freedom fighter. However, the \"silent majority\" of Kurds living in Turkey reportedly oppose the PKK and revile Ocalan. The charismatic Ocalan was unquestioningly accepted by devoted PKK members, and the PKK reportedly lacked dissenting factions, at least until the early 1990s. The PKK's Leninist structure constrained any internal debate. However, in March 1991 Ocalan admitted at a press conference that he was facing a challenge from a faction within the PKK that wanted him to work for autonomy within Turkey instead of a separate Kurdish state and recognition of the PKK as a political force. When Ocalan, who is said to speak very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:87:e4b04e2d5dc9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8641, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "accepted by devoted PKK members, and the PKK reportedly lacked dissenting factions, at least until the early 1990s.

However, in March 1991 Ocalan admitted at a press conference that he was facing a challenge from a faction within the PKK that wanted him to work for autonomy within Turkey instead of a separate Kurdish state and recognition of the PKK as a political force. When Ocalan, who is said to speak very little Kurdish, agreed to this position and announced a cease-fire in March 1993, the decision was not unanimous, and there was dissension within the PKK leadership over it. The PKK's recruitment efforts mainly have targeted the poorer classes of peasants and workers, the latter group living in the standard apartment ghettos on the fringes of Turkey's industrial cities. According to a Turkish survey in the southeast cited by Barkey and Fuller, of the 35 percent of those surveyed who responded to a question on how well they knew members of the PKK, 42 percent claimed to have a family member in the PKK. The Turkish government has maintained that the PKK recruits its guerrillas forcibly and then subjects them to \"brainwashing\" sessions at training camps in Lebanon. According to the official Ankara Journalist Association, \"members of the organization are sent into armed clashes under the influence of drugs. [PKK leaders] keep them under the influence of drugs so as to prevent them from seeing the reality.\" Scholars also report that the PKK has forced young men to join. In November 1994, the PKK's former American spokesperson, Kani Xulum, told James Ciment that the PKK recruits only those who understand \"our strategies and aims\" and \"we're careful to keep psychopaths\" out of the organization. The PKK has laws regarding military conscription. At its 1995 congress, the PKK decided not to recruit youth younger than 16 to fight and to make military service for women voluntary. By the mid-1990s, PKK volunteers increasingly came from emigre families in Germany and the rest of Europe and even Armenia and Australia. Since it began operating, the PKK's ranks have included a sprinkling of female members. However, according to O'Ballance, \"Its claim that they lived and fought equally side by side with their male colleagues can be discounted, although there were some exceptions. Women were employed mainly on propaganda, intelligence, liaison and educational tasks. The PKK claimed that women accounted for up to 30 percent of its strength.\" In April 1992, the ARGK claimed that it had a commando force of some 400 armed women guerrillas in the mountains of northern Iraq. James Ciment reported in 1996 that approximately 10 percent of PKK guerrillas are women. Thomas Goltz, a journalist specializing in Turkey, reports that beginning in the mid-1990s, \"Many female recruits were specially trained as suicide bombers for use in crowded urban environments like Istanbul's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:88:1d40d5d84d68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8642, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "claimed that women accounted for up to 30 percent of its strength.\" In April 1992, the ARGK claimed that it had a commando force of some 400 armed women guerrillas in the mountains of northern Iraq.

Thomas Goltz, a journalist specializing in Turkey, reports that beginning in the mid-1990s, \"Many female recruits were specially trained as suicide bombers for use in crowded urban environments like Istanbul's bazaar and even on the beaches favored by European tourists along the Turkish Riviera.\" For example, a 19-year-old suicide female commando wounded eight policemen in a suicide attack in Istanbul in early July 1999. The well-funded PKK's recruitment efforts have probably been aided significantly by its mass media outlets, particularly Med-TV, a PKK-dominated Kurdish-language TV station that operates by satellite transmission out of Britain. Ocalan himself often participated, by telephone, in the Med-TV talk shows, using the broadcasts to Turkey and elsewhere to convey messages and make announcements. Med-TV commands a wide viewership among the Kurds in southeast Turkey. Barkey and Fuller describe the PKK as \"primarily a nationalist organization,\" but one still with ties to the Left, although it claimed to have abandoned Marxism-Leninism by the mid-1990s. They report that, according to some Kurdish observers, \"Ocalan has begun to show considerably more maturity, realism, and balance since 1993,\" moving away from ideology toward greater pragmatism. Barley and Graham confirm that the PKK \"has been undergoing a significant shift in its political orientation\" since the mid-1990s, including moving away from its anti-Islamism and \"toward greater reality in its assessment of the current political environment\" and the need to reach a political settlement with Turkey. The PKK leadership's seemingly psychotic vengeful streak became an issue in the assassination of Olaf Palme, the prime minister of Sweden, who was shot and killed while walking in a Stockholm street on February 28, 1986. PKK members immediately became the prime suspects because of the group's extremist reputation. According to John Bulloch and Harvey Morris, \"The motive was thought to be no more than a Swedish police determination that the PKK was a terrorist organization, and that as a result a visa had been refused for Ocalan to visit the country, which has a large and growing Kurdish minority.\" On September 2, 1987, PKK militant Hasan Hayri Guler became the prime suspect. According to *Hurriyet*, a Turkish newspaper, Hasan Hayri Guler reportedly was sent to Stockholm with orders to assassinate Palme in retaliation for the death of a PKK militant in Uppsala, Sweden. (The PKK denied the accusation and hinted that Turkish security forces may have been behind Palme's murder.)

In late 1998, Syria, under intense pressure from Turkey, closed the PKK camps and expelled Ocalan, who began an odyssey through various nations in search of political asylum. In February 1999, he was captured in Kenya and flown to Turkey. Ocalan had the reputation of being a dogmatic, strict, and hard disciplinarian, even tyrannical. Scholars Henri J. Barkey and Graham E. Fuller, citing a Turkish book, describe him as: secretive, withdrawn, suspicious, and lacking in self-confidence. He does not like group discussion; his close associates reportedly seem uncomfortable around him. He does not treat others as equals and he often demeans his subordinates in front of others, demands self-confessions from his lieutenants, and keeps his distance from nearly everyone. The ruthlessness with which Kurdish collaborators and PKK defectors were treated by the PKK reflected Ocalan's brutish attitude. Some PKK defectors have also alleged intimidation of guerrillas within PKK camps and units in the field. \"If anyone crosses [Ocalan], either with eyes or attitude, he is accused of creating conflict,\" one defector was quoted by a Danish weekly. \"The sinner is then declared a contra-guerrilla, and his punishment is death.\" According to the *Turkish Daily News*, Ocalan underlined his personal hunger for absolute power at the helm of the PKK in a party publication in 1991 as follows: I establish a thousand relationships every day and destroy a thousand political, organizational, emotional and ideological relationships. No one is indispensable for me. Especially if there is anyone who eyes the chairmanship of the PKK. I will not hesitate to eradicate them. I will not hesitate in doing away with people. Ocalan has also been described as \"a smiling, fast-talking and quick-thinking man,\" but one who \"still follows an old Stalinist style of thinking, applying Marxist principles to all problems....\" He is reportedly given to exaggeration of his importance and convinced that he and his party alone have the truth. Turkish journalists who have interviewed Ocalan have come away with the impression of a \"megalomaniac\" and \"sick\" man who has no respect for or understanding of the \"superior values of European civilization.\" A December 1998 issue of the *Turkish Daily News* quoted Ocalan as saying in one of his many speeches: Everyone should take note of the way I live, what I do and what I don't do. The way I eat, the way I think, my orders and even my inactivity should be carefully studied. There will be lessons to be learned from several generations because Apo is a great teacher.

Ocalan's capture and summary trial initially appeared to have radicalized the PKK. The return of two senior PKK members to the main theater of operations following Ocalan's capture seemed to indicate that a new more hard-line approach was emerging within the PKK leadership. Ali Haidar and Kani Yilmaz, former PKK European representatives, were summoned back to the PKK's main headquarters, now located in the Qandil Mountain Range straddling Iraq and Iran. *Jane's Defence Weekly* reports that their return suggested that the PKK's military wing exercises new authority over the PKK's political or diplomatic representatives, whose approach was seen as failing in the wake of Ocalan's capture. (In addition to Haidar and Yilmaz, the PKK's ruling six-member Presidential Council includes four other senior and long-serving PKK commanders: Cemil Bayik (\"Cuma\"), Duran Kalkan (\"Abbas\"), Murat Karayillan (\"Cemal\"), and Osman Ocalan (\"Ferhat\")). However, on August 5, 1999, the PKK's Presidential Council declared that the PKK would obey Ocalan's call to abandon its armed struggle and pull out of Turkey. Whether all the PKK groups would do the same or whether the PKK's gesture merely amounted to a tactical retreat remained to be seen. In any case, the rebels began withdrawing from Turkey in late August 1999. The PKK remains divided between political and military wings. The political wing favors a peaceful political struggle by campaigning for international pressure on Ankara. It is supported by hundreds of thousands of Kurds living in Europe. The military wing consists of about 4,500 guerrillas operating from the mountains of Turkey, northern Iraq, and Iran. It favors continuing the war and stepping up attacks if Ocalan is executed. Karayillan, a leading military hard-liner, is reportedly the most powerful member of the Council and slated to take over if Ocalan is executed. ***Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)*** **Group Profile** ***Background*** The LTTE is widely regarded as the world's deadliest and fiercest guerrilla/terrorist group and the most ferocious guerrilla organization in South Asia. It is the only terrorist group to have assassinated three heads of government--Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993, and former Prime Minister Dissanayake in 1994. It has also assassinated several prominent political and military figures. The LTTE's ill-conceived Gandhi assassination, however, resulted in the LTTE's loss of a substantial logistical infrastructure, and also the loss of popular support for the LTTE among mainstream Indian Tamils.

It has also assassinated several prominent political and military figures. The LTTE's ill-conceived Gandhi assassination, however, resulted in the LTTE's loss of a substantial logistical infrastructure, and also the loss of popular support for the LTTE among mainstream Indian Tamils. In 1999 the LTTE made two threats on the life of Sonia Gandhi, who has nevertheless continued to campaign for a seat in parliament. Also known as the Tamil Tigers, the LTTE is a by-product of Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict between the majority Sinhalese people and the minority ethnic Tamils, whose percentage of the island's population has been reported with figures ranging from 7 per cent to 17 percent. As a result of government actions that violated the rights of the Tamils in Sri Lanka in the 1948-77 period, a large pool of educated and unemployed young people on the island rose up against the government in 1972, under the leadership of the reputed military genius, Velupillai Prabhakaran. The Tigers and other Tamil militant groups realized the importance of creating an exclusively Tamil northern province for reasons of security, and began their campaign for the independence of Tamil Eelam, in the northern part of the island. Founders of the military youth movement, Tamil New Tigers, formed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on May 5, 1976. In one of its first major terrorist acts, it destroyed an Air Ceylon passenger jet with a time bomb in September 1978. The LTTE is only one of five groups, albeit the supreme one, that have achieved dominance over more than 35 Tamil guerrilla groups. Nationalism has remained the driving force behind the Tiger Movement. The Tamil guerrilla movement is mainly composed of groups known as the Tigers, a term applied to the movement's numerous factions. According to Robert C. Oberst, The groups, commonly called 'Tigers,' are shadowy collections of youths which emerged in the early 1980s as full-fledged politico-military organizations. Prior to that time they were loosely organized, and centered around dominant personalities. The bloody ethnic riots of July 1983 polarized the Sinhalese and Tamil communities and became a watershed in the history of Sri Lanka. The riots started by the Sinhalese were a reaction to the death of 13 soldiers in a Tiger ambush. The end result was that around 500,000 Tamils left for India and the West, seeking asylum. They became the economic backbone of the terrorist campaign, and in the years that followed, the Tigers established offices and cells throughout the world, building a network unsurpassed by any other terrorist group. By 1987 the LTTE had emerged as the strongest militant group in Sri Lanka. More than two generations of Tamil youth have now been indoctrinated with separatism. ***Membership Profile*** The LTTE is an exclusively ethnic organization consisting almost", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:92:fb34aa05630f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8646, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "Tamils left for India and the West, seeking asylum.

By 1987 the LTTE had emerged as the strongest militant group in Sri Lanka. More than two generations of Tamil youth have now been indoctrinated with separatism. ***Membership Profile*** The LTTE is an exclusively ethnic organization consisting almost entirely of Tamil Hindu youth. Although a majority of members of the Tamil guerrilla groups are Hindu, a significant number of Tamil Christians reportedly are in the movement. The early supporters of the Tamil independence movement were in their thirties. Since then, the age level has declined sharply. In the 1970s, quotas on university admissions for Tamils prompted younger Tamils to join the insurgency. By 1980 a majority of LTTE combatants were reportedly between 18 and 25 years of age, with only a few in their thirties. In 1990 approximately 75 percent of the second-generation LTTE membership were below 30 years of age, with about 50 percent between the ages of 15 and 21 and about 25 percent between the ages of 25 and 29. Highly motivated and disciplined, most LTTE fighters are subteenagers, according to an Indian authority. **LTTE child soldiers** (Photo courtesy of *Asiaweek, *July 26, 1996) The majority of the rank and file membership belong to the lower middle class. Almost all LTTE cadres have been recruited from the lower-caste strata of Jaffna society. The Tamil Tigers draw their recruits from the Tamils who live in the northern province and some from the eastern province. The cadres drawn from other areas of the northern and eastern provinces are only lower-rung \"troops\" who do not hold any place of importance or rank. In 1993 the LTTE reportedly had about 10,000 men in its fighting cadres, all Tamils and Hindus. Deputy Defense Minister General Anuruddha Ratwatte reported in March 1999 that LTTE recruitment had been limited since early 1998 and reduced in strength to a fighting cadre of fewer than 3,000, down from 4,000 to 5,000 members. As a result of its depleted manpower strength, the LTTE has become largely dependent on its Baby Brigade, which is comprised of boys and girls of ages ranging from 10 to 16 years. In May 1999, in an apparently desperate plan to establish a Universal People's Militia, the LTTE began to implement compulsory military training of all people over the age of 15 in areas under LTTE control in the Vanni. Among the world's child combatants, children feature most prominently in the LTTE, whose fiercest fighting force, the Leopard Brigade (Sirasu puli), is made up of children.

In 1983 the LTTE established a training base in the state of Pondicherry in India for recruits under 16, but only one group of children was trained. By early 1984, the nucleus of the LTTE Baby Brigade (Bakuts) was formed. The LTTE trained its first group of women in 1985. In October 1987, the LTTE stepped up its recruitment of women and children and began integrating its child warriors into other units. LTTE leader Prabhakaran reportedly had ordered the mass conscription of children in the remaining areas under LTTE control, especially in the northeastern Mullaittivu District. From late 1995 to mid-1996, the LTTE recruited and trained at least 2,000 Tamils largely drawn from the 600,000 Tamils displaced in the wake of the operations to capture the peninsula. About 1,000 of these were between 12 and 16 years old. In 1998 Sri Lanka's Directorate of Military Intelligence estimated that 60 percent of LTTE fighters were below 18 and that a third of all LTTE recruits were women. According to an estimate based on LTTE fighters who have been killed in combat, 40 percent of LTTE's force are both males and females between nine and 18 years of age. Since April 1995, about 60 percent of LTTE personnel killed in combat have been children, mostly girls and boys aged 10 to 16. Children serve everywhere except in leadership positions. **LTTE child combats** (Photo courtesy of *Asiaweek, *July 26, 1996) The entire LTTE hardcore and leaders are from Velvettihura or from the \"fisher\" caste, which has achieved some social standing because of the AK-47s carried by many of its militant members. According to Oberst, many tend to be university-educated, English-speaking professionals with close cultural and personal ties to the West. However, several of the important Tiger groups are led by Tamils who are relatively uneducated and nonprofessional, from a middle-status caste. ***LTTE Suicide Commandos*** The LTTE has a female military force and uses some females for combat. Indeed, female LTTE terrorists play a key role in the force. An unknown number of LTTE's female commandos are members of the LTTE's elite commando unit known as the Black Tigers. Members of this unit are designated as \"suicide commandos\" and carry around their necks a glass vial containing potassium cyanide. Suicide is common in Hindu society, and the Tigers are fanatical Hindus. The cyanide capsule, which LTTE members view as the ultimate symbol of bravery and commitment to a cause, is issued at the final initiation ceremony.

A LTTE commando who wears the capsule must use it without fail in the event of an unsuccessful mission, or face some more painful form of death at the hands of the LTTE. One of the first reported instances when LTTE members had to carry out their suicide vow was in October 1987, when the LTTE ordered a group of captured leaders being taken to Colombo to commit suicide. **LTTE child soldier with a cyanide capsule in his hand** (Photo courtesy of *Asiaweek, *July 26, 1996) The Black Tigers include both male and female members. The LTTE \"belt-bomb girl\" who assassinated Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991, after garlanding him with flowers, was an 18-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil Hindu, who had semtex sachets taped to her body. The blast also killed 17 others, including a LTTE photographer recording the action. Over the subsequent two months of investigations, as many as 25 LTTE members committed suicide to avoid capture. Although the Gandhi assassination had huge negative repercussions for the LTTE, suicide attacks have remained the LTTE's trademark. On January 31, 1996, a LTTE suicide bomber ran his truck carrying 440 pounds of explosives into the front of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, killing at least 91 people and wounding 1,400, as well as damaging a dozen office buildings in Sri Lanka's busy financial district. On March 16, 1999, a LTTE \"belt-bomb girl\" blew herself to bits when she jumped in front of the car of the senior counter-terrorism police officer in an attack just outside Colombo. The car, swerved, however, and escaped the full force of the blast. An accomplice of the woman then killed himself by swallowing cyanide. More recently, on July 29, 1999, a LTTE \"belt-bomb girl\" assassinated Neelan Tiruchelvam, a Harvard-educated, leading Sri Lankan moderate politician and peacemaker, in Colombo by blowing herself or himself up by detonating a body bomb next to the victim's car window. **Leader Profile** ***Velupillai Prabhakaran*** **Position:** Top leader of the LTTE. **Background:** Velupillai Prabhakaran was born on November 27, 1954. He is a native of Velvettihurai, a coastal village near Jaffna, where he hails from the \"warrior-fisherman\" caste.

He is a native of Velvettihurai, a coastal village near Jaffna, where he hails from the \"warrior-fisherman\" caste. He is the son of a pious and gentle Hindu government official, an agricultural officer, who was famed for being so incorruptible that he would refuse cups of tea from his subordinates. During his childhood, Prabhakaran spent his days killing birds and squirrels with a slingshot. An average student, he preferred historical novels on the glories of ancient Tamil conquerors to his textbooks. As a youth, he became swept up in the growing militancy in the northern peninsula of Jaffna, which is predominately Tamil. After dropping out of school at age 16, he began to associate with Tamil \"activist gangs.\" On one occasion as a gang member, he participated in a political kidnapping. In 1972 he helped form a militant group called the New Tamil Tigers, becoming its co-leader at 21. He imposed a strict code of conduct over his 15 gang members: no smoking, no drinking, and no sex. Only through supreme sacrifice, insisted Prabhakaran, could the Tamils achieve their goal of Eelam, or a separate homeland. In his first terrorist action, which earned him nationwide notoriety, Prabhakaran assassinated Jaffna's newly elected mayor, a Tamil politician who was a member of a large Sinhalese political party, on July 27, 1973 [some sources say 1975]. Prabhakaran won considerable power and prestige as a result of the deed, which he announced by putting up posters throughout Jaffna to claim responsibility. He became a wanted man and a disgrace to his pacifist father. In the Sri Lankan underworld, in order to lead a gang one must establish a reputation for sudden and decisive violence and have a prior criminal record. Qualifying on both counts, Prabhakaran then was able to consolidate control over his gang, which he renamed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on May 5, 1976. **Velupillai Prabhakaran** (Photo courtesy of *Rediff on the Net*, April 3,1999) In Tamil Nadu, Prabhakaran's exploits in the early 1980s turned him into a folk hero. His fierce eyes glared from calendars. Gradually and ruthlessly, he gained control of the Tamil uprising. Prabhakaran married a fiery beauty named Mathivathani Erambu in 1983. Since then, Tigers have been allowed to wed after five years of combat. Prabhakaran's wife, son, and daughter (a third child may also have been born) are reportedly hiding in Australia. The LTTE's charismatic \"supremo,\" Prabhakaran has earned a reputation as a military genius. A portly man with a moustache and glittering eyes, he has also been described as \"Asia's new Pol Pot,\" a \"ruthless killer,\" a \"megalomaniac,\" and an \"introvert,\" who is rarely seen in public except before battles or to host farewell banquets for Tigers setting off on suicide missions.

He spends time planning murders of civilians, including politicians, and perceived Tamil rivals. Prabhakaran is an enigma even to his most loyal commanders. Asked who his heroes are, Prabhakaran once named actor Clint Eastwood. He has murdered many of his trusted commanders for suspected treason. Nevertheless, he inspires fanatical devotion among his fighters. Prabhakaran and his chief intelligence officer and military leader, Pottu Amman, are the main LTTE leaders accused in Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. On January 27, 1998, the Colombo High Court issued warrants for the arrest of Prabhakaran, Amman, and eight others accused of killing 78 persons and destroying the Central Bank Building by the bomb explosion in 1996 and perpetrating other criminal acts between July 1, 1995, and January 31, 1996. Prabhakaran has repeatedly warned the Western nations providing military support to Sri Lanka that they are exposing their citizens to possible attacks. **Social Revolutionary Groups** ***Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)*** (aka Fatah--The Revolutionary Council, Black June Organization, Arab Revolutionary Brigades, Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims) **Group Profile** Since 1974 the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) is said to have killed more than 300 people and wounded more than 650 in 20 countries. In recent years, however, as Abu Nidal has become little more than a symbolic head of the ANO, the ANO appears to have passed into near irrelevance as a terrorist organization. By mid-1984 the ANO had about 500 members. A highly secretive, mercenary, and vengeful group, ANO has carried out actions under various aliases on several continents on behalf of Middle East intelligence organizations, such as those of Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Libya, as well as other terrorist groups, such as the Shi'ites in southern Lebanon. For many of its attacks, the ANO has used its trademark Polish W.Z.63 submachine gun. Relying primarily on highly motivated young Palestinian students, Abu Nidal has run a highly disciplined and professional organization, but one held together by terror; many members have been accused of treason, deviation, or desertion and eliminated. For Abu Nidal, the enemy camp comprises everyone who opposes the forceful liberation of Palestine. Together with Zionism and imperialism, a special place in this pantheon is occupied by those in the Arab world supporting the political process, whether Arab regimes or Arafat's PLO. Abu Nidal's Fath (Revolutionary Council) sees itself as the true heir of the authentic Fath, which must be saved from the \"founding fathers\" (Arafat and his cohorts) who betrayed its heritage. Abu Nidal's Fath represents a model of secular Palestinian fundamentalism,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:97:36414c0b5af4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8651, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "camp comprises everyone who opposes the forceful liberation of Palestine.

Abu Nidal's Fath represents a model of secular Palestinian fundamentalism, whose sacred goal is the liberation of Palestine. In 1976-78 Abu Nidal began to establish a corps of dormant agents by forcing young Palestinian students on scholarships in Europe to become his agents. After a short training period in Libya, Iraq, or Syria, they were sent abroad to remain as dormant agents for activation when needed. Despite the ruthlessness of ANO terrorism, ANO members may have a very conservative appearance. Robert Hitchens, a British journalist and reportedly one of the few foreigners to have met Abu Nidal, was highly impressed by the cleanliness of Abu Nidal's headquarters in Baghdad, and by the \"immaculate dress of his men,\" who were \"all clean-shaven and properly dressed,\" as well as very polite. Recruiting is highly selective. In the early 1980s, members typically came from families or hometowns of earlier members in Lebanon, but by the mid-1980s the ANO began to increase recruitment by drawing from refugee camps. Graduates of the first training program would be driven to southern Lebanon, where they would undergo several weeks of military training. A few weeks later, they would be driven to Damascus airport, issued new code names, and flown to Tripoli, where they would be transferred to ANO training camps. In the mid-1980s, Abu Nidal continued to recruit from Arab students studying in Europe. Madrid has served as an important source for recruiting these students. In the 1987-92 period, most of Abu Nidal's trainees at his camp located 170 kilometers south of Tripoli continued to be alienated Palestinian youths recruited from Palestinian refugee camps and towns in Lebanon. They were flown to Libya on Libyan military transports from the Damascus airport in groups of about 100. Abu Nidal's recruitment efforts were directed at very young students, whom he would promise to help with education, career prospects, and families. In addition to paying them a good salary, he lauded the students for fulfilling their duty not just to Palestine but to the whole Arab nation by joining his organization, which he claimed was inspired by the noblest Arab virtues. The selection process became very serious once the new recruits arrived at ANO training camps in Libya. New recruits were made to sign warrants agreeing to be executed if any intelligence connection in their backgrounds were later to be discovered.

New recruits were made to sign warrants agreeing to be executed if any intelligence connection in their backgrounds were later to be discovered. They were also required to write a highly detailed autobiography for their personal file, to be used for future verification of the information provided. While still on probation, each new recruit would be assigned to a two-man cell with his recruiter and required to stand guard at the Abu Nidal offices, distribute the Abu Nidal magazine, or participate in marches and demonstrations. Some were ordered to do some intelligence tasks, such as surveillance or reporting on neighborhood activities of rival organizations. New recruits were also required to give up alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, and women. They were ordered never to ask the real name of any Abu Nidal member or to reveal their own, and to use only codenames. Throughout their training, recruits were drilled in and lectured on the ANO's ten fundamental principles: commitment, discipline, democratic centralism, obedience to the chain of command, initiative and action, criticism and self-criticism, security and confidentiality, planning and implementation, assessment of experience gained, and thrift. Infractions of the rules brought harsh discipline. Recruits suspected of being infiltrators were tortured and executed. According to the *Guardian*, by the late 1990s the ANO was no longer considered an active threat, having broken apart in recent years in a series of feuds as Abu Nidal became a recluse in his Libyan haven. According to the *New York Times*, Abu Nidal still had 200 to 300 followers in his organization in 1998, and they have been active in recent years, especially against Arab targets. As of early 1999, however, there were reports that the ANO was being torn apart further by internal feuds, defections, and lack of financing. Half of Abu Nidal's followers in Lebanon and Libya reportedly had defected to Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and moved to the Gaza Strip. **Leader Profile** ***Abu Nidal*** **Position:** Leader of the ANO. **Background:** Abu Nidal was born Sabri al-Banna in May 1937 in Jaffa, Palestine, the son of a wealthy orange grower, Khalil al-Banna, and of his eighth wife. His father was reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in Palestine, primarily from dealing in property. Abu Nidal's family also had homes in Egypt, France, and Turkey. His father died in 1945, when Sabri was attending a French mission school in Jaffa. His more devout older brothers then enrolled him in a private Muslim school in Jerusalem for the next two years, until the once wealthy family was forced into abject poverty. The Israeli government confiscated all of the al-Banna land in 1948, including more than 6,000 acres", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:99:13f8419535b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8653, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "men in Palestine, primarily from dealing in property.

The Israeli government confiscated all of the al-Banna land in 1948, including more than 6,000 acres of orchards. After living in a refugee camp in Gaza for nine months, the family moved to Nablus on the West Bank, when Sabri al-Banna was 12 years old. An average student, he graduated from high school in Nablus in 1955. **Sabri al-Banna (\"Abu Nidal\")** (Photo courtesy of* The Washington Post*, 1999) That year Sabri joined the authoritarian Arab nationalist and violence-prone Ba'ath Party. He also enrolled in the engineering department of Cairo University, but two years later returned to Nablus without having graduated. In 1958 he got a demeaning job as a common laborer with the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco) in Saudi Arabia. In 1960 he also set up an electronic contracting shop in Riyadh. His character traits at that time included being an introvert and stubborn. In 1962, while back in Nablus, he married and then returned with his wife to Saudi Arabia. Political discussions with other Palestinian exiles in Saudi Arabia inspired him to become more active in the illegal Ba'ath Party and then to join Fatah. In 1967 he was fired from his Aramco job because of his political activities, imprisoned, and tortured by the Saudis, who then deported him to Nablus. As a result of the Six-Day War and the entrance of Israeli forces into Nablus, he formed his own group called the Palestine Secret Organization, which became more militant in 1968 and began to stir up trouble. He moved his family to Amman, where he joined Fatah, Yasser Arafat's group and the largest of the Palestinian commando organizations. In 1969 Abu Nidal became the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) representative in Khartoum, and while there he apparently first came in contact with Iraqi intelligence officers. In August 1970, he moved to Baghdad, where he occupied the same post, and became an agent of the Iraqi intelligence service. After the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, he left Fatah to start his own organization. With Iraqi weapons, training, and intelligence support, his first major act of terrorism was to seize the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Paris on September 5, 1973. Later Iraqi officials reportedly admitted that they had commissioned Abu Nidal to carry out the operation. During 1973-74, the relationship between Abu Nidal and Arafat worsened. Abu Nidal himself has suggested that he left Fatah because of the PLO's willingness to accept a compromise West Bank state instead of the total liberation of Palestine.

Abu Nidal himself has suggested that he left Fatah because of the PLO's willingness to accept a compromise West Bank state instead of the total liberation of Palestine. By mid-1974 Abu Nidal was replaced because of his increasing friendliness with his Iraqi host. In October 1974, Iraq sponsored the Rejection Front. Abu Nidal did not join, however, because of his recent expulsion from the PLO, and he was organizing his own group, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, with the help of the Iraqi leadership. In 1978 Abu Nidal began to retaliate for his ouster from the PLO by assassinating the leading PLO representatives in London, Kuwait, and Paris. He subsequently assassinated the leading PLO representative in Brussels in 1981 and the representatives in Bucharest, Romania, in 1984. Other attempts failed. In 1983 Abu Nidal's hitmen in Lisbon also assassinated one of Arafat's most dovish advisers. In addition to his terrorist campaign against the PLO, Abu Nidal carried out attacks against Syria. He organized a terrorist group called Black June (named after the month the Syrian troops invaded Lebanon) that bombed Syrian embassies and airline offices in Europe, took hostages at a hotel in Damascus, and attempted to assassinate the Syrian foreign minister. In November 1983, Saddam expelled Abu Nidal from Iraq because of pressure applied by the United States, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates--all allies of Iraq in the ongoing war against Iran. Abu Nidal moved his headquarters to Syria. From late 1983 to 1986, Hafiz al-Assad's government employed ANO to carry out two main objectives: to intimidate Arafat and King Hussein, who were considering taking part in peace plans that excluded Syria, and to attempt to assassinate Jordanian representatives (mainly diplomats). Between 1983 and 1985, the ANO attacked Jordanians in Ankara, Athens, Bucharest, Madrid, New Delhi, and Rome, as well as bombed offices in these capitals. The Gulf states, mainly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates were also attacked because they were late in paying him protection money. Other ANO attacks included the machine-gun massacres of El Al passengers at the Vienna and Rome airports on December 27, 1985. Abu Nidal's relationship with Syria weakened, however, because Assad treated him as a contract hitman rather than a Palestinian leader and because Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States applied intense pressures on Assad's regime to end terrorism. After Syrian intelligence caught one of Abu Nidal's lieutenants at the Damascus airport carrying sensitive documents and found weapons that he had stored in Syria without their knowledge, Syria expelled Abu Nidal in 1987. After the expulsion, he moved to Libya.

After Syrian intelligence caught one of Abu Nidal's lieutenants at the Damascus airport carrying sensitive documents and found weapons that he had stored in Syria without their knowledge, Syria expelled Abu Nidal in 1987. After the expulsion, he moved to Libya. Abu Nidal appeared to be more secure in Libya. He followed the same pattern that he had established in Iraq and Syria. He organized attacks on the enemies of his friends (Libya's enemies included the United States, Egypt, and the PLO), bombed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, hijacked planes, and gunned down 21 Jews at an Istanbul synagogue. In Libya, however, internal feuds ripped ANO apart. In 1989-90 hundreds died in battles between Abu Nidal and dissidents supported by the PLO, who sought to take control of his operations in Libya and Lebanon. A curious feature of Abu Nidal's terrorism is that more than 50 percent of it has been directed against Arab and Palestinian rivals. The ANO's vicious war against the PLO has led to Arab claims that it was secretly manipulated by Israel's Mossad secret service. According to this seemingly far-fetched hypothesis, the Mossad penetrated Abu Nidal's organization and has manipulated Abu Nidal to carry out atrocities that would discredit the Palestinian cause. The hypothesis is based on four main points: Abu Nidal killings have damaged the Palestinian cause to Israel's advantage, the suspicious behavior of some of Abu Nidal's officials, the lack of attacks on Israel, lack of involvement in the Intifada, and Israel's failure to retaliate against Abu Nidal's groups. Another distinctive feature of Abu Nidal's terrorism is that the ANO has generally not concerned itself with captured ANO members, preferring to abandon them to their fate rather than to attempt to bargain for their release. These traits would seem to suggest that the ANO has been more a product of its leader's paranoid psychopathology than his ideology. Abu Nidal's paranoia has also been evident in interviews that he has supposedly given, in which he has indicated his belief that the Vatican was responsible for his fallout with Iraq and is actively hunting down his organization. Wary of being traced or blown up by a remote-controlled device, he allegedly never speaks on a telephone or two-way radio, or drinks anything served to him by others. In recent years, the aging and ailing Abu Nidal has slipped into relative obscurity. On July 5, 1998, two days after 10 ANO members demanded his resignation as ANO chief, the Egyptians arrested Abu Nidal, who was carrying a Tunisian passport under a false name. Egyptian security officers eventually ordered the 10 dissident members of his group out of Egypt.

Egyptian security officers eventually ordered the 10 dissident members of his group out of Egypt. Abu Nidal was rumored to be undergoing treatment in the Palestinian Red Crescent Society Hospital in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. In mid-December 1998, he went from Egypt to Iraq after fleeing a hospital bed in Cairo, where he had quietly been undergoing treatment for leukemia. Abu Nidal's physical description seems to vary depending on the source. In 1992 Patrick Seale described Abu Nidal as \"a pale-skinned, balding, pot-bellied man, with a long thin nose above a gray mustache.\" One trainee added that Abu Nidal was not very tall and had blue-green eyes and a plump face. ***Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC)*** **Group Profile** Ahmad Jibril, a Palestinian who had served as a captain in the Syrian army before joining first the Fatah and later the PFLP, became disillusioned with the PFLP's emphasis on ideology over action and for being too willing to compromise with Israel. Consequently, in August 1968 Jibril formed the PFLP-GC as a breakaway faction of the PFLP. The PFLP-GC is a secular, nationalist organization that seeks to replace Israel with a \"secular democratic\" state. Like the PFLP, the PFLP-GC has refused to accept Israel's continued existence, but the PFLP-GC has been more strident and uncompromising in its opposition to a negotiated solution to the Palestinian conflict than the PFLP and, unlike the PFLP, has made threats to assassinate Yasir Arafat. Terrorist actions linked to the PFLP-GC have included the hang-glider infiltration of an operative over the Lebanese border in November 1987, the hijacking of four jet airliners on September 6, 1970, and the bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, causing 270 deaths. Libyan agents were later charged for the Pan Am bombing, but Jibril and his PFLP-GC have continued to be suspected of some involvement, such as planning the operation and then giving it to the Libyans. In recent years, the PFLP-GC, weakened by reduced support from Syria and Jibril's health problems, has not been associated with any major international terrorist action. Its activities have focused on guerrilla attacks against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. In 1991 the PFLP-GC had about 500 members and was attempting to recruit new members. It is known that the PFLP looks for support from the working classes and middle classes, but little has been reported about the PFLP-GC's membership composition.

It is known that the PFLP looks for support from the working classes and middle classes, but little has been reported about the PFLP-GC's membership composition. The PFLP-GC's presence in the West Bank and Gaza is negligible, however. The PFLP has a strict membership process that is the only acceptable form of recruitment. Although it is unclear whether the PFLP-GC uses this or a similar process, the PFLP's recruiting program is nonetheless described here briefly. A PFLP cell, numbering from three to ten members, recruits new members and appoints one member of a comparably sized PFLP circle to guide PFLP trainees through their pre-membership period. Cells indoctrinate new recruits through the study of PFLP literature and Marxist-Leninist theory. Prior to any training and during the training period, each recruit is closely monitored and evaluated for personality, ability, and depth of commitment to the Palestinian cause. To qualify for membership, the applicant must be Palestinian or Arab, at least 16 years old, from a \"revolutionary class,\" accept the PFLP's political program and internal rules, already be a participant in one of the PFLP's noncombatant organizations, and be prepared to participate in combat. To reach \"trainee\" status, the new recruit must submit an application and be recommended by at least two PFLP members, who are held personally responsible for having recommended the candidate. Trainees undergo training for a period of six months to a year. On completing training, the trainee must be formally approved for full membership. The PFLP-GC political leadership is organized into a General Secretariat, a Political Bureau, and a Central Committee. The PFLP-GC is currently led by its secretary general, Ahmad Jibril. Other top leaders include the assistant secretary general, Talal Naji; and the Political Bureau secretary, Fadl Shururu. In August 1996, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad reportedly asked PFLP-GC chief Ahmad Jibril to leave Syria and go to Iran. However, Jibril apparently was not out of Syria for long. On May 14, 1999, a delegation representing the leadership of the PFLP-GC, led by PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril and comprising PFLP-GC Assistant Secretary General Talal Naji, PFLP-GC Political Bureau Secretary Fadl Shururu, and Central Committee Member Abu Nidal 'Ajjuri, met in Damascus with Iranian President Muhammad Khatami and his delegation, who paid a state visit to the Syrian Arab Republic. Several senior PFLP-GC members quit the group in August 1999 because of Jibril's hard-line against peace negotiations.

The group retains dormant cells in Europe and has close ties to the JRA and Irish terrorists. **Leader Profile** ***Ahmad Jibril*** **Position:** Secretary General of the PFLP-GC. **Background:** Ahmad Jibril was born in the town of Yazur, on land occupied in 1938. Following the Arab-Israeli War in 1948, his family moved to Syria. Late in the second half of the 1950s, he, like other Palestinians, joined the Syrian Army. He attended military college and eventually became a demolitions expert and a captain. While remaining an active officer in the Syrian Army, Jibril tried to form his own militant organization, the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), with a few young Palestinians on the eve of the June 1967 war. Since that time, Jibril has been characterized by two basic constants: not offending or distancing himself from Syria and maintaining a deep-seated hostility toward Fatah and Yasir Arafat. After a brief membership in George Habbash's PFLP, in October 1968 Jibril formed the PFLP-GC, which became known for its military explosives technology. **Ahmad Jibril** (Photo courtesy of* The Washington Post*, 1999) After a long period of suffering and poverty, Jibril had the good fortune in the mid-1970s of becoming acquainted with Libya's Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi in the wake of the downing of a Libyan civilian plane by Israeli fighters over the Sinai. Jibril offered to retaliate, and Qadhafi reportedly gave him millions of dollars to buy gliders and launch kamikaze attacks on an Israeli city. After sending the pilots to certain communist countries for training in suicide missions, Jibril met with Qadhafi and returned the money, saying that twice that amount was needed. Impressed by Jibril's honesty, Qadhafi immediately gave him twice the amount. Despite his huge quantities of weapons and money, Jibril still suffered from low popularity among Palestinians and a lack of presence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reasons cited for his low popularity included his having grown up in Syrian Army barracks, the nature of his alliance with Syria, and the Fatah movement's isolation of him from the Palestinian scene. Jibril suffered a major setback in 1977, when the PFLP-GC split.

Sociologist James Peter says that 80 percent of the FARC's members are peasants, which explains its vitality and development over time. Most FARC members reportedly are poorly educated, young people from rural areas and who are more attracted to the FARC for its relatively good salary and revolutionary adventurism than for ideology. Many are teenagers, both male and female. Many poor farmers and teenagers join the FARC out of boredom or simply because it pays them about $350 a month, which is $100 more than a Colombian Army conscript. Others may be more idealistic. For example, Ramn, a 17-year-old guerrilla, told a *Washington Post* reporter in February 1999 that \"I do not know the word 'Marxism,' but I joined the FARC for the cause of the country...for the cause of the poor.\" The FARC has relied on forced conscription in areas where it has had difficulties recruiting or in instances in which landowners are unable to meet FARC demands for \"war taxes.\" In early June 1999, the FARC's Eduardo Deva (\"Raul Reyes\") pledged to a United Nations representative not to recruit or kidnap more minors. Although the FARC has traditionally been a primarily peasant-based movement, its membership may have broadened during the 1990s as a result of the steadily expanding area under FARC control. Timothy P. Wickham-Crowley points out that \"The most striking single feature of the Colombian guerrilla experience, especially but not only for the FARC, is how thoroughly the entire guerrilla experience has been rooted in local experiences in the countryside.\" Wickham-Crowley qualifies that traditional characteristic, however, by noting that, according to FARC leader Manuel Marulanda, \"there had been an appreciable broadening of the guerrillas' ranks, now including a larger number of urbanites: workers, intellectuals, students, professionals, doctors, lawyers, professors, and priests.\" If true, this would be surprising considering that the FARC's increasingly terrorist actions, such as mass kidnappings, have had the effect of shifting public opinion in Colombia from apathy toward the isolated rural guerrilla groups to increasing concern and a hardening of attitudes toward", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:106:6477636febcf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8660, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "however, by noting that, according to FARC leader Manuel Marulanda, \"there had been an appreciable broadening of the guerrillas' ranks, now including a larger number of urbanites: workers, intellectuals, students, professionals, doctors, lawyers, professors, and priests.\" If true, this would be surprising considering that the FARC's increasingly terrorist actions, such as mass kidnappings, have had the effect of shifting public opinion in Colombia from apathy toward the isolated rural guerrilla groups to increasing concern and a hardening of attitudes toward the guerrillas. According to some analysts, the insurgent organization has approximately 20,000 fighters organized in at least 80 fronts throughout the country, which are especially concentrated in specific areas where the FARC has managed to establish a support base within the peasant population. However, that figure is at the higher end of estimates. In 1999 the FARC reportedly had approximately 15,000 heavily armed combatants. The National Army's intelligence directorate puts the figure even lower, saying that the insurgent group has close to 11,000 men--seven blocs that comprise a total of 61 fronts, four columns, and an unknown number of mobile companies. The FARC was not known to have any women combatants in its ranks in the 1960s, but by the 1980s women were reportedly fighting side by side with FARC men without any special privileges. By 1999 a growing number of FARC troops were women. In contrast to most other Latin American guerrilla/terrorist groups, FARC leaders generally are poorly educated peasants. The formal education of current FARC leader Manuel Marulanda consists of only four years of grammar school. His predecessor, Jocobo Arenas, had only two years of school. Wickham-Crowley has documented the peasant origins of FARC leaders and the organization in general, both of which were a product of the La Violencia period in 1948, when the government attempted to retake the \"independent republics\" formed by peasants. Marulanda's power is limited by the Central General Staff, the FARC's main decision-making body, formed by seven members, including Marulanda. The other six are Jorge Briceño Suarez (\"Mono Jojoy\"), Guillermo Len Saenz Vargas (\"Alfonso Cano\"), Luis Eduardo Deva (\"Ral Reyes\"), Rodrigo Londoño Echeverry (\"Timochenko\" or \"Timolen\"), Luciano Marn Arango (\"Ivan Marquez\"), and Efran Guzman Jiménez. Ral Reyes, Joaqun Gmez and Fabian Ramrez, who have led lengthy military and political careers within the insurgent ranks, have been present during the peace talks with the government in 1999. Ral Reyes is in charge of finances and international policy; Fabian Ramrez is a commander with the Southern Bloc, one of the organization's largest operations units; and Joaqun Gmez is a member of the Southern Bloc's General Staff. At the beginning of the 1980s, the FARC leadership decided to send about 20 of its best youth to receive training in the military academies of the now former Soviet Union.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the FARC leadership decided to send about 20 of its best youth to receive training in the military academies of the now former Soviet Union. The FARC's new second-generation of guerrilla leaders--those young FARC members who completed political-military training abroad and are beginning to assume important military responsibilities--have been educated more for waging war than making peace. Since the mid-1990s, these second-generation FARC military leaders have been gradually assuming greater military responsibilities and taking over from the FARC's first-generation leaders. The division between so-called moderates and hard-liners within the FARC leadership constitutes a significant vulnerability, if it can be exploited. Whereas Marulanda represents the supposedly moderate faction of the FARC and favors a political solution, Jorge Briceño (\"Mono Jojoy\") represents the FARC hard-liners who favor a military solution. Marulanda must know that he will not live long enough to see the FARC take power. Thus, he may prefer to be remembered in history as the FARC leader who made peace possible. However, should Marulanda disappear then Mono Jojoy and his fellow hard-liners will likely dominate the FARC. Mono Jojoy, who does not favor the peace process, reportedly has been the primary cause of a rupture between the FARC's political and military branches. **Leader Profiles** ***Pedro Antonio Marn/Manuel Marulanda Vélez*** **Position:** FARC founder and commander in chief. **Background:** Since its inception in May 1966, the FARC has operated under the leadership of Pedro Antonio Marn (aka \"Manuel Marulanda Vélez\" or \"Tirofijo\"--Sure Shot). Marn was born into a peasant family in Génova, Quindo Department, a coffee-growing region of west-central Colombia. He says he was born in May 1930, but his father claimed the date was May 12, 1928. He was the oldest of five children, all brothers. His formal education consisted of only four years of elementary school, after which he went to work as a woodcutter, butcher, baker, and candy salesman. His family supported the Liberal Party. When a civil war erupted in 1948 following the assassination of a Liberal president, Marn and a few cousins took to the mountains. On becoming a guerrilla, Marn adopted the pseudonym of Manuel Marulanda Vélez in tribute to a trade unionist who died while opposing the dispatch of Colombian troops to the Korean War. **Pedro Antonio Marn** (Photo courtesy of *www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/6433/04.html*) A professional survivor, an experienced tactician, and a determined commander, Marulanda Vélez has been officially pronounced dead several times in army communiqués, but he has always reappeared in guerrilla actions.

Although only five feet tall, he is a charismatic guerrilla chieftain who has long been personally involved in combat and has inspired unlimited confidence among his followers. He ascended to the top leadership position after the death of Jocobo Arenas from a heart attack in 1990. He is reported to be a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia (Partido Comunista de Colombia--PCC), which has historically been associated with the FARC. According to author Alfredo Rangel Suarez, Marulanda \"is not a theoretician by any means, but he is very astute and has a great capacity for command and organization.\" Rangel Suarez believes that Marulanda is a hardcore Marxist-Leninist. However, Marulanda's peasant origins and his innate sense of military strategy have earned him nationwide recognition as a leader among politicians, leftists, and other guerrilla groups. Marulanda is not known to have ever married, although he reportedly has numerous children by liaisons with various women. According to journalist Mara Jimena Duzan, Marulanda lives simply, like a peasant, and without any luxuries, such as cognac. However, he smokes cigarettes. ***Jorge Briceño Suarez (\"Mono Jojoy\")*** **Position:** Second in command of the FARC; commander, Eastern Bloc of the FARC; member, FARC General Secretariat since April 1993. **Background:** Jorge Briceño Suarez was born in the Duda region of Colombia, in the jurisdiction of Uribe, Meta Department, in 1949. His father was the legendary guerrilla Juan de la Cruz Varela, and his mother was a peasant woman, Romelia Suarez. He grew up and learned to read and write within the FARC. For years, he was at the side of Manuel Marulanda Vélez (\"Tirofijo\"--Sureshot), who is considered his tutor and teacher. Mono Jojoy is a jovial-looking, heavy-set man who wears a handlebar moustache and who normally wears a simple green camouflage uniform and a black beret. He is another of the new second-generation FARC military chiefs who was born in the FARC. Both he and \"Eliécer\"created the FARC's highly effective school for \"special attack tactics,\" which trains units to strike the enemy without suffering major casualties. Mono Jojoy is credited with introducing the Vietnam War-style specialized commandos that consist of grouping the best men of each front in order to assign them specific high-risk missions. He is one of the most respected guerrilla leaders within FARC ranks. He became second in command when Marulanda succeeded Jocobo Arenas in 1990. Unlike the other commanders who came to the FARC after university-level studies, Mono Jojoy learned everything about guerrilla warfare in the field. He easily moves among the Departments of Boyaca, Cundinamarca, and Meta.

He easily moves among the Departments of Boyaca, Cundinamarca, and Meta. He is said to know the Sumapaz region \"like the palm of his hand.\" He is known as a courageous guerrilla, who is obsessed with attacking the Public Force, has little emotion, and is laconic. His great military experience helps to compensate for his low intellectual level. He is said to be unscrupulous and to advocate any form of warfare in pursuit of power, including dialoging with the government as a ruse. Under his command, the Eastern Bloc has earned record amounts of cocaine-trafficking profits. He is opposed to extradition of Colombians, including his brother, German Briceño Suarez (\"Grannobles\"), a FARC hard-liner who was charged on July 21, 1999, in the slayings of three U.S. Indian rights activists, who were executed in early 1999. He is contemptuous of the prospect of U.S. military intervention, noting that U.S. soldiers would not last three days in the jungle. However, he would welcome U.S. economic assistance to rural development projects, such as bridge-building. ***German Briceño Suarez (\"Grannobles\")*** **Position:** Commander, 10th, 28th, 38th, 45th, and 56th fronts. **Background:** German Briceño, younger brother of Jorge Briceño Suarez, was born in the Duda region of Colombia, in the jurisdiction of Uribe, Meta Department, in 1953. His father was the legendary guerrilla Juan de la Cruz Varela, and his mother was a peasant woman, Romelia Suarez. At the recommendation of his brother, German Briceño became an official member of the FARC in 1980. Even from that early date, German Briceño showed himself to be more of a fighter and bolder than his older brother, despite the latter's own reputation for boldness. German Briceño was promoted rapidly to commander of the FARC's 30th Front in Cauca Department. After founding a combat training school in that department's Buenos Aires municipality, he began to be known for his meanness. He was reportedly suspended temporarily from the FARC for his excesses against the peasants and his subordinates, but later readmitted as a commander, thanks to his brother. However, he was transferred to Vichada Department, where he engaged in weapons trafficking and extortion of taxes from coca growers and drug traffickers. In 1994, after being promoted to his brother's Western Bloc staff, German Briceño took over command of the 10th Front, which operates in Arauca Department and along the Venezuelan border. Since then he has also assumed command of the 28th, 38th, 45th, and 56th fronts, operating in the economically and militarily important departments of Arauca, Boyaca, and Casanare.

Since then he has also assumed command of the 28th, 38th, 45th, and 56th fronts, operating in the economically and militarily important departments of Arauca, Boyaca, and Casanare. In 1994 he reportedly participated, along with his brother, in the kidnappings and murders of American missionaries Stephen Welsh and Timothy van Dick; the kidnapping of Raymond Rising, an official from the Summer Linguistics Institute; and the kidnappings of industrialist Enrique Mazuera Duran and his son, Mauricio, both of whom have U.S. citizenship. German Briceño is also accused of kidnapping British citizen Nigel Breeze, and he is under investigation for the murder of two Colombian Marine Infantry deputy officers and for the kidnappings of Carlos Bastardo, a lieutenant from the Venezuelan navy, as well as about a dozen cattlemen from Venezuela's Apure State. His kidnap victims in Arauca have included the son of Congressman Adalberto Jaimes; and Rubén Dario Lpez, owner of the Arauca convention center, along with his wife. He has also ordered the murders of young women who were the girlfriends of police or military officers. On February 23, 1999, German Briceño also kidnapped, without FARC authorization, three U.S. indigenous activists in Arauca and murdered them a week later in Venezuelan territory. The incident resulted in the breaking off of contact between the FARC and the U.S. Department of State. After a so-called FARC internal investigation, he was exonerated, again thanks to his brother, and a guerrilla named Gildardo served as the fall guy. German Briceño recovered part of his warrior's reputation by leading an offensive against the army in March and April 1999 that resulted in the deaths of 60 of the army's soldiers. On July 30, 1999, however, German Briceño once again carried out an unauthorized action by hijacking a Venezuela Avior commercial flight with 18 people on board (they were released on August 8). ***\"Eliécer\"*** **Position:** A leading FARC military tactician. **Background:** \"Eliécer\" was born in the FARC in 1957, the son of one of the FARC's founders. He walked through the Colombian jungles at the side of his father. Tall, white, and muscular, he is a member of the so-called second-generation of the FARC. One the FARC's most highly trained guerrillas, he received military training in the Soviet Union. The late FARC ideologist Jocobo Arenas singled out Eliécer for this honor.

Following his stay in East Germany, he received guerrilla combat experience in Central America. Commander \"Eliécer\" became the FARC's military chief of Antioquia Department at the end of 1995. A modern version of Manuel Marulanda, Eliécer is regarded as cold, calculating, a very good conversationalist, cultured, and intuitive. By 1997 he was regarded as one of the FARC's most important tacticians. He and \"Mono Jojoy\"created the FARC's highly effective school for \"special attack tactics,\" which trains units to strike the enemy without suffering major casualties. In Antioquia Eliécer was assigned to work alongside Efran Guzman (\"El Cucho\"), a member of the FARC Staff and a FARC founder who was 60 years old in 1996. ***Revolutionary Organization 17 November (17N)*** **Group Profile** Since the group's initial appearance with the assassination of U.S. official Richard Welch in an Athens suburb with a Colt .45-caliber magnum automatic pistol on December 23, 1975, no known member of the shadowy Revolutionary Organization 17 November (Epanastatiki Organosi 17 Noemvri--17N) has been apprehended. Thus, the membership and internal dynamics of this small, mysterious, and well-disciplined group remain largely unknown. It has been claimed in some news media that the identity of no member of 17N is known to Greek, American, or European police and intelligence agencies. However, the group's ability to strike with impunity at its chosen targets for almost a quarter century without the apprehension of a single member has reportedly made Western intelligence agencies suspect it of being the instrument of a radicalized Greek intelligence service, the GYP, according to the* Observer* [London]. According to one of the *Observer's* sources, Kurdish bomber Seydo Hazar, 17N leaders work hand-in-glove with elements of the Greek intelligence service. According to the *Observer*, 17N has sheltered the PKK by providing housing and training facilities for its guerrillas. Police were kept away from PKK training camps by 17N leaders who checked the identity of car license plates with Greek officials. Funds were obtained and distributed to the PKK by a retired naval commander who lives on a Greek military base and is a well-known sympathizer of 17N. What little is known about 17N derives basically from its target selection and its rambling written communiqués that quote Balzac or historical texts, which a member may research in a public library. Named for the 1973 student uprising in Greece protesting the military regime, the group is generally believed to be an ultranationalist, Marxist-Leninist organization that is anti-U.S., anti-Turkey, anti-rich Greeks, anti-German, anti-European Union (EU),", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:112:b271b9b9ba0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8666, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "commander who lives on a Greek military base and is a well-known sympathizer of 17N.

Named for the 1973 student uprising in Greece protesting the military regime, the group is generally believed to be an ultranationalist, Marxist-Leninist organization that is anti-U.S., anti-Turkey, anti-rich Greeks, anti-German, anti-European Union (EU), and anti-NATO, in that order. It has also been very critical of Greek government policies, such as those regarding Cyprus, relations with Turkey, the presence of U.S. bases in Greece, and Greek membership in NATO and the European Union (EU). In its self-proclaimed role as \"vanguard of the working class,\" 17N has also been critical of Greek government policies regarding a variety of domestic issues. One of the group's goals is to raise the \"consciousness of the masses\" by focusing on issues of immediate concern to the population. To these ends, the group has alternated its attacks between so-called \"watchdogs of the capitalist system\" (i.e., U.S. diplomatic and military personnel and \"secret services\") and \"servants of the state\" (such as government officials, security forces, or industrialists). It has been responsible for numerous attacks against U.S. interests, including the assassination of four U.S. officials, the wounding of 28 other Americans, and a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Athens in February 1996. The group justified its assassination of Welch by blaming the CIA for \"contributing to events in Cyprus\" and for being \"responsible for and supporting the military junta.\" Unlike most European Marxist-Leninist terrorist groups that are in their third or fourth generation of membership, the 17N group has been able to retain its original hard-core members. In 1992, according to 17N expert Andrew Corsun, the group's hard-core members were most likely professionals such as lawyers, journalists, and teachers in their late thirties and early forties. If that is the case, most of the group's core membership, which he estimated to be no more than twenty, would today be mostly in their forties. Moreover, the 17N communiques, with a five-pointed star and the name \"17N,\" typically come from the same typewriter that issued the movement's first proclamation in 1975, shortly before Welch's execution. According to the prosecutor who examined the files on 17N accumulated by late Attorney General Dhimitrios Tsevas, the group comprises a small circle of members who are highly educated, have access and informers in the government, and are divided into three echelons: General Staff, operators, and auxiliaries. The core members are said to speak in the cultivated Greek of the educated. There appears to be general agreement among security authorities that the group has between 10 and 25 members, and that its very small size allows it to maintain its secrecy and security.

There appears to be general agreement among security authorities that the group has between 10 and 25 members, and that its very small size allows it to maintain its secrecy and security. The origin of the group is still somewhat vague, but it is believed that its founders were part of a resistance group that was formed during the 1967-75 military dictatorship in Greece. It is also believed that Greek Socialist Premier Andreas Papendreou may have played some hand in its beginnings. After democracy returned to Greece in 1975, it is believed that many of the original members went their own way. N17 is considered unique in that it appears not to lead any political movement. One of the group's operating traits is the fact that more than 10 of its attacks in Athens, ranging from its assassination of U.S. Navy Captain George Tsantes on November 15, 1983, to its attack on the German ambassador's residence in early 1999, took place in the so-called Khalandhri Triangle, a triangle comprising apartment blocks under construction in the suburb of Khalandhri and situated between Kifisias, Ethinikis Antistaseos, and Rizariou. The terrorists are believed by authorities to know practically every square foot of this area. Knowing the urban terrain intimately is a basic tenet of urban terrorism, as specified by Carlos Marighella, author of *The Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla*. The continuing hard-core membership is suggested by the fact that the group murdered Cosfi Peraticos, scion of a Greek shipping family, in June 1997 with the same Colt .45 that it used to assassinate Richard Welch in 1975. The group has actually used the Colt .45 in more attacks than those in 1975 and 1997 (see Table 6, Appendix). Since the Welch assassination, its signature Colt .45 has been used to kill or wound at least six more of its 20 victims, who include three other American officials and one employee, two Turkish diplomats, and 13 Greeks. The rest have been killed by another Colt .45, bombs, and anti-tank missiles. The group's repeated use of its Colt .45 and typewriter suggests a trait more typical of a psychopathic serial killer. In the political context of this group, however, it appears to be symbolically important to the group to repeatedly use the same Colt .45 and the same typewriter. Authorities can tell that the people who make bombs for the 17N organization were apparently trained in the Middle East during the early 1970s.

Among the announced members of this terrorist organization are the Egyptian Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah, the Egyptian Al-Jihad, the Egyptian Armed Group, the Pakistan Scholars Society, the Partisan Movement for Kashmir, the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh, and bin Laden's Afghan military wing of the Advice and Reform Commission (Bodansky: 316). Unlike most terrorist groups, Al-Qaida is more of a home base and financier for a global network of participating Islamic groups. According to Bodansky (308-9), bin Laden and his close advisers live in a three-chamber cave in eastern Afghanistan, in the mountains near Jalalabad. One room is used as bin Laden's control and communications center and is equipped with a state-of-the-art satellite communications system, which includes, in addition to a satellite telephone, a desktop computer, at least a couple laptops, and fax machines. Another room is used for storage of weapons such as AK-47s, mortars, and machine guns. A third room houses a large library of Islamic literature and three cots. His immediate staff occupy cave bunkers in nearby mountains. Bin Laden is ingratiating himself with his hosts, the Taliban, by undertaking a massive reconstruction of Qandahar. In the section reserved for the Taliban elite, bin Laden has built a home of his own, what Bodansky (312) describes as \"a massive stone building with a tower surrounded by a tall wall on a side street just across from the Taliban's \"foreign ministry\" building.\" Bin Laden's project includes the construction of defensive military camps around the city. In addition, in the mountains east of Qandahar, bin Laden is building bunkers well concealed and fortified in mountain ravines. After the U.S. cruise missile attack against his encampment on August 20, 1998, bin Laden began building a new headquarters and communications center in a natural cave system in the Pamir Mountains in Kunduz Province, very close to the border with Tajikistan. According to Bodansky (312-13), the new site will be completed by the first half of 2000. Bodanksy (326) reports that, since the fall of 1997, bin Laden has been developing chemical weapons at facilities", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:115:ba17d04a9848", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8669, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "fortified in mountain ravines.

According to Bodansky (312-13), the new site will be completed by the first half of 2000. Bodanksy (326) reports that, since the fall of 1997, bin Laden has been developing chemical weapons at facilities adjacent to the Islamic Center in Soba, one of his farms located southwest of Khartoum, Sudan. Meanwhile, since the summer of 1998 bin Laden has also been preparing terrorist operations using biological, chemical, and possibly radiological weapons at a secret compound near Qandahar. By 1998 a new generation of muhajideen was being trained at bin Laden's camps in eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bin Laden's Afghan forces consist of more than 10,000 trained fighters, including almost 3,000 Arab Afghans, or Armed Islamic Movement (AIM), which is also known as the International Legion of Islam. According to Bodansky (318-19), Egyptian intelligence reported that these Arab Afghans total 2,830, including 177 Algerians, 594 Egyptians, 410 Jordanians, 53 Moroccans, 32 Palestinians, 162 Syrians, 111 Sudanese, 63 Tunisians, 291 Yemenis, 255 Iraqis, and others from the Gulf states. The remaining 7,000 or so fighters are Bangladeshis, Chechens, Pakistanis, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other nationalities. Bodansky (318) reports that the 5,000 trainees at one training center in Afghanistan are between 16 and 25 years of age and from all over the world. The Martyrdom Battalions are composed of human bombs being trained to carry out spectacular terrorist operations. **Leader Profiles:** ***Osama bin Laden*** (\"Usama bin Muhammad bin Laden, Shaykh Usama bin Laden, the Prince, the Emir, Abu Abdallah, Mujahid Shaykh, Hajj, the Director\") **Position:** Head of Al-Qaida. **Background:** Usamah bin Mohammad bin Laden, now known in the Western world as Osama bin Laden, was born on July 30, 1957, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the seventeenth son of Mohammad bin Laden. The late Mohammad bin Laden rose from peasant origins in Yemen to become a small-time builder and contractor in Saudi Arabia and eventually the wealthiest construction contractor in Saudi Arabia.. He had more than 50 children from several wives. Osama bin Laden's mother was reportedly a Palestinian. Depending on the source of information, she was the least or most favored of his father's ten wives, and Osama was his father's favorite son. He was raised in the Hijaz in western Saudi Arabia, and ultimately al Medina Al Munawwara. The family patriarch died in the late 1960s, according to one account, but was still active in 1973, according to another account.

In any case, he left his 65 children a financial empire that today is worth an estimated $10 billion. The Saudi bin Laden Group is now run by Osama's family, which has publicly said it does not condone his violent activities. After being educated in schools in Jiddah, the main port city on the Red Sea coast, bin Laden studied management and economics in King Abdul Aziz University, also in Jiddah, from 1974 to 1978. As a student, he often went to Beirut to frequent nightclubs, casinos, and bars. However, when his family's construction firm was rebuilding holy mosques in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina in 1973, bin Laden developed a religious passion for Islam and a strong belief in Islamic law. In the early 1970s, he began to preach the necessity of armed struggle and worldwide monotheism, and he also began to associate with Islamic fundamentalist groups. **Osama bin Laden** (AP Photo; www.cnn.com) Bin Laden's religious passion ignited in December 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Muslim Afghanistan. Bin Laden's worldview of seeing the world in simplistic terms as a struggle between righteous Islam and a doomed West prompted him to join the mujahideen in Pakistan, just a few days after the invasion. In the early 1980s, he returned home to fund, recruit, transport, and train a volunteer force of Arab nationals, called the Islamic Salvation Front (ISF), to fight alongside the existing Afghan mujahideen. He co-founded the Mujahideen Services Bureau (Maktab al-Khidamar) and transformed it into an international network that recruited Islamic fundamentalists with special knowledge, including engineers, medical doctors, terrorists, and drug smugglers. In addition, bin Laden volunteered the services of the family construction firm to blast new roads through the mountains. As commander of a contingent of Arab troops, he experienced combat against the Soviets first-hand, including the siege of Jalalabad in 1986--one of the fiercest battles of the war, and he earned a reputation as a fearless fighter. Following that battle, bin Laden and other Islamic leaders concluded that they were victims of a U.S. conspiracy to defeat the jihad in Afghanistan and elsewhere. By the time the Soviet Union had pulled out of Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden was leading a fighting force known as \"Afghan Arabs,\" which numbered between 10,000 and 20,000. That year, after the Soviets were forced out of Afghanistan, bin Laden disbanded the ISF and returned to the family construction business in Saudi Arabia. However, now he was a celebrity, whose fiery speeches sold a quarter million cassettes. The Saudi government rewarded his hero status with numerous government construction contracts.

However, now he was a celebrity, whose fiery speeches sold a quarter million cassettes. The Saudi government rewarded his hero status with numerous government construction contracts. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, bin Laden urged the Saudi government not to compromise its Islamic legitimacy by inviting infidel Americans into Saudi Arabia to defend the country, but he was ignored.. Although bin Laden, unlike most other Islamic leaders, remained loyal to the regime while condemning the U.S. military and economic presence as well as the Iraqi invasion, Saudi officials increasingly began to threaten him to halt his criticism. Consequently, bin Laden and his family and a large band of followers moved to Sudan in 1991. While living modestly in Sudan, bin Laden established a construction company employing many of his former Afghan fighters. In addition to building roads and infrastructure for the Sudanese government, he ran a farm producing sunflower seeds and a tannery exporting goat hides to Italy. Sudan served as a base for his terrorist operations. In 1992 his attention appears to have been directed against Egypt, but he also claimed responsibility that year for attempting to bomb U.S. soldiers in Yemen, and again for attacks in Somalia in 1993. He also financed and help set up at least three terrorist training camps in cooperation with the Sudanese regime, and his construction company worked directly with Sudanese military officials to transport and supply terrorists training in such camps. During the 1992-96 period, he built and equipped 23 training camps for mujahideen. While in Sudan, he also established a supposedly detection-proof financial system to support Islamic terrorist activities worldwide. In the winter of 1993, bin Laden traveled to the Philippines to support the terrorist network that would launch major operations in that country and the United States. In 1993-94, having become convinced that the House of al-Saud was no longer legitimate, bin Laden began actively supporting Islamic extremists in Saudi Arabia. His calls for insurrection prompted Saudi authorities to revoke his Saudi citizenship on April 7, 1994, for \"irresponsible behavior,\" and he was officially expelled from the country. He subsequently established a new residence and base of operations in the London suburb of Wembley, but was forced to return to Sudan after a few months to avoid being extradited to Saudi Arabia. In early 1995, he began stepping up activities against Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In mid-May 1996, pressure was applied by the Saudi government on Sudan to exert some form of control over bin Laden.

That summer, he uprooted his family again, returning to Afghanistan on board his unmarked, private C-130 military transport plane. Bin Laden established a mountain fortress near the city of Kandahar southwest of Jalalabad, under the protection of the Afghan government. From this location, he continues to fund his training camps and military activities. In particular, bin Laden continues to fund the Kunar camp, which trains terrorists for Al-Jihad and Al-Jama' ah al-Islamiyyah. After attending a terrorism summit in Khartoum, bin Laden stopped in Tehran in early October 1996 and met with terrorist leaders, including Abu Nidal, to discuss stepping up terrorist activities in the Middle East. A mysterious figure whose exact involvement with terrorists and terrorist incidents remains elusive, bin Laden has been linked to a number of Islamic extremist groups and individuals with vehement anti-American and anti-Israel ideologies. His name has been connected to many of the world's most deadly terrorist operations, and he is named by the U.S. Department of State as having financial and operational connections with terrorism. Some aspects of bin Laden's known activities have been established during interviews, mainly with Middle Eastern reporters and on three occasions of the release of fatwas (religious rulings) in April 1996, February 1997, and February 1998. Each threatened a jihad against U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and the Holy Lands, and each called for Muslims to concentrate on \"destroying, fighting and killing the enemy.\"Abdul-Bari Atwan, editor of *al-Quds al-Arabi* [London], who interviewed bin Laden at his Afghan headquarters in the Khorassan mountains, reports that: The mujahideen around the man belong to most Arab states, and are of different ages, but most of them are young. They hold high scientific degrees: doctors, engineers, teachers. They left their families and jobs and joined the Afghan Jihad. There is an open front, and there are always volunteers seeking martyrdom. The Arab mujahideen respect their leader, although he does not show any firmness or leading gestures. They all told me that they are ready to die in his defense and that they would take revenge against any quarter that harms him. A tall (6'4\" to 6'6\"), thin man weighing about 160 pounds and wearing a full beard, bin Laden walks with a cane.

He is described in some sources as ordinary and shy. He speaks only Arabic. Because he has dared to stand up to two superpowers, bin Laden has become an almost mythic figure in the Islamic world. Thanks to the ineffectual U.S. cruise missile attack against his camps in Afghanistan following the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, thousands of Arabs and Muslims, seeing him as a hero under attack by the Great Satan, have volunteered their service. In 1998 bin Laden married his oldest daughter to Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's leader. He himself married a fourth wife, reportedly a young Pushtun related to key Afghan leaders. Thus, Bodansky points out, now that he is related to the Pushtun elite by blood, the ferocious Pushtuns will defend and fight for him and never allow him to be surrendered to outsiders. Bin Laden's son Muhammad, who was born in 1985, rarely leaves his father's side. Muhammad has already received extensive military and terrorist training and carries his own AK-47. He serves as his father's vigilant personal bodyguard. ***Ayman al-Zawahiri*** **Position:** Bin Laden's second in command and the undisputed senior military commander. **Background:** Al-Zawahiri, who claims to be the supreme leader of the Egyptian Jihad, is responsible for converting bin Laden to Islamic fundamentalism. ***Subhi Muhammad Abu-Sunnah (\"Abu-Hafs al-Masri\")*** **Position:** Military Commander of al-Qaida. **Background:** A prominent Egyptian fundamentalist leader. He has close ties to bin Laden and has accompanied him on his travels to Arab and foreign countries. He also helped to establish the al-Qaida organization in Afghanistan in early 1991. He moved his activities with bin Laden to Sudan and then backed to Afghanistan. ***Hizballah (Party of God)*** ***Alias:*** Islamic Jihad **Group Profile** Hizballah, an extremist political-religious movement based in Lebanon, was created and sponsored by a contingent of 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGs) dispatched to Lebanon by Iran in July 1982, initially as a form of resistance to the Israeli presence in southern Lebanon. Hizballah's followers are Shia Muslims, who are strongly anti-Western and anti-Israeli and totally dedicated to the creation of an Iranian-style Islamic Republic in Lebanon and the removal of non-Islamic influences in the area. Hizballah's following mushroomed in 1982 as both the Iranians and their local allies in Lebanon indoctrinated young and poor Shia peasants and young people in West Beirut's poor Shia suburbs through films, ideological seminars, and radio broadcasts.

Hizballah's following mushroomed in 1982 as both the Iranians and their local allies in Lebanon indoctrinated young and poor Shia peasants and young people in West Beirut's poor Shia suburbs through films, ideological seminars, and radio broadcasts. The Islamic fundamentalist groups in Lebanon have been most successful in recruiting their followers among the slum dwellers of south Beirut. By late 1984, Hizballah is thought to have absorbed all the known major extremist groups in Lebanon. Hizballah's worldview, published in a 1985 manifesto, states that all Western influence is detrimental to following the true path of Islam. In its eyes, the West and particularly the United States, is the foremost corrupting influence on the Islamic world today: thus, the United States is known as \"the Great Satan.\" In the same way, the state of Israel is regarded as the product of Western imperialism and Western arrogance. Hizballah believes that the West installed Israel in the region in order to continue dominating it and exploiting its resources. Thus, Israel represents the source of all evil and violence in the region and is seen as an outpost of the United States in the heart of the Islamic Middle East. In Hizballah's eyes, Israel must, therefore, be eradicated. Hizballah sees itself as the savior of oppressed and dispossessed Muslims. Hizballah's central goals help to explain the nature and scope of its use of terrorism. These include the establishment of an exclusively Shia, Iran-style Islamic state in Lebanon; the complete destruction of the state of Israel and the establishment of Islamic rule over Jerusalem and Palestine; and an implacable opposition to the Middle East peace process, which it has tried to sabotage through terrorism. The typical Hizballah member in 1990 was a young man in his late teens or early twenties, from a lower middle-class family. In Hizballah's first years, many members were part-time soldiers. By 1990, however, most of the militia and terrorist group members were believed to be full-time \"regulars.\" In the early 1980s, Hizballah used suicide commandos as young as 17, including a beautiful Sunni girl, who killed herself and two Israeli soldiers. In the last decade or so, however, Hizballah has been using only more mature men for special missions and attacks, while continuing to induct youths as young as 17 into its guerrilla ranks. Hizballah's military branch includes not only members recruited from the unemployed, but also doctors, engineers, and other professionals. In 1993 Iranian sources estimated the number of Hizballah's fighters at 5,000 strong, plus 600 citizens from Arab and Islamic countries; the number of the party's political cadres and workers was estimated at 3,000 strong.

Within this larger guerrilla organization, Hizballah has small terrorist cells organized on an informal basis. They may consist of the personal following of a particular leader or the relatives of a single extended family. Hizballah is divided between moderates and radicals. Shaykh Muhammud Husayn Fadlallah, Hizballah's spiritual leader, is considered a moderate leader. The radical camp in 1997 was led by Ibrahim Amin and Hasan Nasrallah. The latter is now Hizballah's secretary general. **Leader Profile** ***Imad Fa'iz Mughniyah*** **Position:** Head of Hizballah's Special Operations Command. **Background:** Imad Mughniyah was born in about 1961 in southern Lebanon. He has been wanted by the FBI since the mid-1980s. He is a charismatic and extremely violent individual. His physical description, according to Hala Jaber (1997:120), is \"short and chubby with a babyish face.\" Mughniyah served in the PLO's Force 17 as a highly trained security man specializing in explosives. In 1982, after his village in southern Lebanon was occupied by Israeli troops, he and his family took refuge in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where he was soon injured by artillery fire. Disillusioned by the PLO, he joined the IRGs. His first important task apparently was to mastermind the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1982, in which 22 people were killed. On September 2, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for Mughniyah for ordering that bombing. His next important tasks, on behalf of Syria and Iran, were the truck bombings that killed 63 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in April 1983, and another 241 U.S. Marines and sailors at their barracks near Beirut airport the following October; the hijacking of an American airliner in 1985, in which one American was killed; and the 1995 hijacking of TWA flight 847 from Athens to Rome. He also kidnapped most of the Americans who were held hostage in Lebanon, including William Buckley, who was murdered, as well as the British envoy, Terry Waite. In December 1994, his brother was killed by a car bomb placed outside his shop in Beirut. In mid-February 1997, the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army radio station reported that Iran's intelligence service dispatched Mughniyah to Lebanon to directly supervise the reorganization of Hizballah's security apparatus concerned with Palestinian affairs in Lebanon and to work as a security liaison between Hizballah and Iranian intelligence. Mughniyah also reportedly controls Hizballah's security apparatus, the Special Operations Command, which handles intelligence and conducts overseas terrorist acts.

Mughniyah also reportedly controls Hizballah's security apparatus, the Special Operations Command, which handles intelligence and conducts overseas terrorist acts. Operating out of Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, Mughniyah is known to frequently travel on Middle East Airlines (MEA), whose ground crews include Hizballah members. Although he uses Hizballah as a cover, he reports to the Iranians. ***Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)*** **Group Profile** In December 1987, when the Palestinian uprising (Intifada) erupted, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and other followers of the Muslim Brotherhood Society (Jama'at al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin--MB), who had been running welfare, social, and educational services through their mosques, immediately established the Islamic Resistance Movement (Harakat al Muqawana al Islamiyyah--Hamas). Hamas's militant wing Al Qassam ('Izz al-Din al-Qassam) played a major role in the Intifada. Responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers, Hamas gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unpredictability. During the Intifada, two main organizational trends toward decentralization of Hamas developed: Hamas's political leadership moved to the neighboring Arab states, mainly Jordan; and grass-roots leaders, representing young, militant activists, attained increased authority and increased freedom of action within their areas of operation. Hamas's leadership remains divided between those operating inside the Occupied Territories and those operating outside, mainly from Damascus. Mahmoud el-Zahar, Hamas's political leader in Gaza, operated openly until his arrest in early 1996 by Palestinian security forces. Impatient with the PLO's prolonged efforts to free the Occupied Territories by diplomatic means, in November 1992 Hamas formed an alliance with Iran for support in the continuation of the Intifada. That December, 415 Palestinians suspected of having links with Hamas were expelled from Israel into Lebanon, where they were refused refugee status by Lebanon and neighboring Arab states. They remained for six months in a desert camp until international condemnation of the deportations forced Israel to agree to their return. In September 1993, Hamas opposed the peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and maintained a campaign of violence within Israel aimed at disrupting the Middle East peace process. Its militant wing, Al-Qassam, claimed responsibility for two bomb attacks within Israel in April 1994 and for a further bus bombing in Tel Aviv in October 1994. All were carried out by suicide bombers. The most persistent image of Hamas in the Western media is that of a terrorist group comprised of suicide bombers in the occupied territories and a radical terrorist faction in Damascus. However, Hamas is also a large socioreligious movement involved in communal work within the Palestinian refugee camps and responsible for many civic-action projects. It runs a whole range of cultural, educational,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:123:fc3447aa5d5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8677, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 124, "text": "for a further bus bombing in Tel Aviv in October 1994. All were carried out by suicide bombers. The most persistent image of Hamas in the Western media is that of a terrorist group comprised of suicide bombers in the occupied territories and a radical terrorist faction in Damascus. However, Hamas is also a large socioreligious movement involved in communal work within the Palestinian refugee camps and responsible for many civic-action projects. It runs a whole range of cultural, educational, political, and social activities based on mosques and local community groups. In 1996 most of Hamas's estimated $70 million annual budget was going to support a network of hundreds of mosques, schools, orphanages, clinics, and hospitals in almost every village, town, and refugee camp on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Consequently, Hamas has massive grass-roots support. In 1993 Hamas's support reportedly varied from more than 40 percent among the Gaza population as a whole to well over 60 percent in certain Gaza refugee camps, and its support in the West Bank varied from 25 percent to as much as 40 percent. Hamas was reported in early 1996 to enjoy solid support among 15 percent to 20 percent of the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. According to Professor Ehud Sprinzak of Hebrew University, Hamas is so popular among 20 to 30 percent of Palestinians not because it has killed and wounded hundreds of Israelis but because it has provided such important community services for the Palestinian population. Moreover, Hamas activists live among the poor and have a reputation for honesty, in contrast with many Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) activists. Hamas supporters reportedly cross both tribal patterns and family patterns among Palestinians. The same family often has brothers in both the PLO and Hamas. Hamas's social services also provide both a cover and a recruiting ground for young Hamas terrorists. Hamas members have been recruited from among believers at Hamas-run mosques, which are also used for holding meetings, organizing demonstrations, distributing leaflets, and launching terrorist attacks. Hamas's ability to recruit leading West Bank religious activists into its leadership ranks has broadened its influence. ***The Suicide Bombing Strategy*** Sprinzak points out that Hamas's opposition to the peace process has never led it to pursue a strategy of suicide bombing. Rather, the group has resorted to this tactic as a way of exacting tactical revenge for humiliating Israeli actions. For example, in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview in 1997, Hassan Salameh, arch terrorist of Hamas, confirmed that the assassination of Yehiya Ayash (\"The Engineer\") by Israelis had prompted his followers to organize three suicide bombings that stunned Israel in 1996. Salameh thus contradicted what former Labor Party prime minister Shimon Peres and other Israeli leaders had contended, that the bombings resulted from a strategic decision by Hamas to bring down the Israeli government.

Salameh thus contradicted what former Labor Party prime minister Shimon Peres and other Israeli leaders had contended, that the bombings resulted from a strategic decision by Hamas to bring down the Israeli government. According to Sprinzak, the wave of Hamas suicide bombings in late 1997, the third in the series, started in response to a series of Israeli insults of Palestinians that have taken place since the beginning of 1997, such as unilateral continuation of settlements. Similarly, Sprinzak notes, Hamas did not initially pursue a policy of bombing city buses. Hamas resorted to this tactic only after February 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and army reserve captain, massacred 29 Palestinians praying in a Hebron shrine. The professor's policy prescriptions for reducing Hamas's incentives to commit terrorist atrocities against Israel are to recognize that Hamas is a Palestinian fact of life and to desist from aggressive policies such as unilateral continuation of settlements and assassination of Hamas leaders. Hamas thrives on the misery and frustration of Palestinians. Its charter, Jerrold Post notes, is pervaded with paranoid rhetoric. The harsh Israeli blockade of Palestinian areas has only strengthened Hamas. ***Selection of Suicide Bombers*** Hamas's suicide bombers belong to its military wing, Al-Qassam. The Al-Qassam brigades are composed of small, tightly knit cells of fanatics generally in their mid- to late twenties. In Hamas, selection of a suicide bomber begins with members of Hamas's military cells or with members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who circulate among organizations, schools, and mosques of the refugee camps in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The recruiter will broach the subject of dying for Allah with a group of students and watch the students' reactions. Students who seem particularly interested in the discussion are immediately singled out for possible \"special merit.\" In almost every case, these potential bombers--who range in age from 12 to 17 years--have a relative or close friend who was killed, wounded, or jailed during the Israeli occupation. Bombers are also likely to have some longstanding personal frustration, such as the shame they suffered at the hands of friends who chastised them for not throwing stones at the Israeli troops during the Intifada. Theirs is a strong hatred of the enemy that can only be satisfied through a religious act that gives them the courage to take revenge. The suicide bombers are of an age to be regarded by the community as old enough to be responsible for their actions but too young to have wives and children. Hamas claims that its suicide bombers repeatedly volunteer to be allowed to be martyrs.

The suicide bombers are of an age to be regarded by the community as old enough to be responsible for their actions but too young to have wives and children. Hamas claims that its suicide bombers repeatedly volunteer to be allowed to be martyrs. These young persons, conditioned by years of prayer in Hamas mosques, believe that as martyrs they will go to heaven. These aspiring suicide bombers attend classes in which trained Islamic instructors focus on the verses of the Koran and the Hadith, the sayings of the Prophet that form the basis of Islamic law and that idealize and stress the glory of dying for Allah. Students are promised an afterlife replete with gold palaces, sumptuous feasts, and obliging women. Aside from religion, the indoctrination includes marathon sessions of anti-Israeli propaganda. Students entering the program quickly learn that \"the Jews have no right to exist on land that belongs to the Muslims.\" Students are assigned various tasks to test their commitment. Delivering weapons for use in clandestine activities is a popular way to judge the student's ability to follow orders and keep a secret. Some students are even buried together in mock graves inside a Palestinian cemetery to see if the idea of death spooks them. Students who survive this test are placed in graves by themselves and asked to recite passages from the Koran. It is at this stage that the recruits, organized in small groups of three to five, start resembling members of a cult, mentally isolated from their families and friends. The support granted by Hamas to the families of suicide bombers and others killed in clashes with Israel are considered vital to Hamas's military operations because they play an important role in recruiting. Graduates of Hamas's suicide schools know that their supreme sacrifice will see their families protected for life. For someone used to a life of poverty, this is a prized reward. Hamas awards monthly stipends in the range of $1,000 to the families of the bombers. Scholarships for siblings and foodstuffs are also made available. Hamas pays for the resettlement of all suicide bomber families who lose their homes as a result of Israeli retribution. Before embarking on his or her final mission directly from a mosque, the young suicide bomber spends many days chanting the relevant scriptures aloud at the mosque. The mantras inculcate a strong belief in the bomber that Allah and Heaven await. For example, a favorite verse reads: \"Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. No, they live on and find their sustenance in the presence of their Lord.\" This belief is strong enough to allow the bomber to mingle casually among his intended", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:126:b7fced4bbae5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8680, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "directly from a mosque, the young suicide bomber spends many days chanting the relevant scriptures aloud at the mosque.

No, they live on and find their sustenance in the presence of their Lord.\" This belief is strong enough to allow the bomber to mingle casually among his intended victims without showing any nervousness. To ensure the utmost secrecy, a bomber learns how to handle explosives only right before the mission. This practice also minimizes the time in which the bomber could have second thoughts about his martyrdom that could arise from using explosives over time. In the past, it was common for the bomber to leave a written will or make a videotape. This custom is no longer practiced because the General Security Service, the secret service, known by its initials in Hebrew as Shin Bet, has arrested other suicide bombers on the basis of information left on these records. In November 1994, the names of 66 Al-Qassam Brigade Martyrs, along with their area of residence, date of martyrdom, and means of martyrdom, were published for the first time. In the late 1990s, the name or the picture of the bomber is sometimes not even released after the suicide attack. Hamas has even stopped publicly celebrating successful suicide attacks. Nevertheless, pictures of past suicide bombers hang on the walls of barber shops inside the refugee camps, and small children collect and trade pictures of suicide bombers. There is even a teenage rock group known as the \"Martyrs\" that sings the praises of the latest bombers entering heaven. In late 1997, Iran reportedly escalated its campaign to sabotage the Middle East peace process by training Palestinian suicide bombers. The two suicide bombers who carried out an attack that killed 22 Israelis on January 22, 1998, reportedly had recently returned from training in Iran. After their deaths, the Iranian government reportedly made payments to the families of both men. On September 5, 1999, four Hamas terrorists, all Israeli Arabs who had been recruited and trained in the West Bank, attempted to carry out a mission to bomb two Jerusalem-bound buses. However, both bombs apparently had been set to explode much earlier than planned, and both exploded almost simultaneously in the terrorists' cars, one in Tiberias and another in Haifa, as they were en route to their targets. **Leader Profiles** ***Sheikh Ahmed Yassin*** **Significance:** Hamas founder and spiritual leader. **Background:** Ahmed Yassin was born near Ashqelan in the south of Palestine in 1937.

After the 1948 Israeli occupation, he lived as a refugee in the Shati camp in Gaza. He became handicapped and confined to a wheelchair in 1952 as a result of an accident. He is also blind and nearly deaf. He received a secondary school education in Gaza and worked as a teacher and preacher there from 1958 until 1978. His association with the Islamic fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood organization began in the 1950s. He founded the Islamic Center in Gaza in 1973. In 1979, influenced by the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, he established Gaza's Islamic Society (Mujamma') and was its director until 1984. Although he was allowed to use the Israeli media to criticize Yasir Arafat and the PLO, Yassin was jailed for 10 months in 1984 for security reasons. He was a well-respected Muslim Brotherhood leader in Gaza running welfare and educational services in 1987 when the Palestinian uprising, Intifada, against Israeli occupation began. He shortly thereafter formed Hamas. He was arrested in May 1989 and sentenced in Israel to life imprisonment for ordering the killing of Palestinians who had allegedly collaborated with the Israeli Army. He was freed in early October 1997 in exchange for the release of two Israeli agents arrested in Jordan after a failed assassination attempt there against a Hamas leader. Yassin then returned to his home in Gaza. He spent much of the first half of 1998 on a fund-raising tour of Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Republics, Iran, and Syria, during which he also received medical treatment in Egypt. Two countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran, reportedly pledged between $50 million and $300 million for Hamas's military operations against Israel. After his tour, and in frail health, Yassin returned to Gaza. **Sheik Ahmed Yassin** (Photo courtesy of *The News-Time*s, January 28, 1998) ***Mohammed Mousa (\"Abu Marzook\")*** **Significance:** Member, Hamas Political Bureau. **Background:** Mohammed Mousa was born in 1951 in Rafah, the Gaza Strip. He completed his basic education in the Gaza Strip, studied engineering at Ein Shams University in Cairo, and graduated in 1977. He worked as manager of a factory in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) until 1981. He then moved to the United States to pursue his doctorate and lived with his family in Falls Church, Virginia, and Brooklyn, New York, for almost 14 years prior to his arrest in 1995. In the early 1980s, he became increasingly involved with militant Muslims in the United States and elsewhere. He co-founded an umbrella organization called the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP) and became head of its governing council.

He co-founded an umbrella organization called the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP) and became head of its governing council. The IAP, now headquartered in Richardson, Texas, established offices in Arizona, California, and Indiana. Beginning in 1987, Mousa allegedly was responsible for launching Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel. In 1989 he became the founding president of the United Association of Studies and Research (UASR), allegedly a covert branch of Hamas responsible for disseminating propaganda and engaging in strategic and political planning, located in Springfield, Virginia. In 1991 he earned a Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering. That year he was elected as Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau, as a result of the arrest of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 1989. Known as an ambitious and charismatic figure, Mousa reorganized Hamas by centralizing political, military, and financial control under his leadership and developing foreign funding. Traveling freely between the United States and Europe, Iran, Jordan, Sudan, and Syria, he allegedly helped to establish a large, clandestine financial network as well as death squads that allegedly were responsible for the murder or wounding of many Israelis and suspected Palestinian collaborators. He led the resumption of suicide bombings in protest of the 1993 Oslo accords. In early 1995, under U.S. pressure, Jordanian authorities expelled him from Amman, where he had set up a major Hamas support office. After leaving Amman, he traveled between Damascus and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, among other places. On July 28, 1995, Mousa arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on a flight from London and was detained by Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agents for being on a \"watch list\" of suspected terrorists. Three days later, Israel formally requested Mousa's extradition to face criminal charges of terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. FBI agents arrested Mousa on August 8, 1995, pending an extradition hearing, and he was jailed at the Federal Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan. Mousa dropped his objection to extradition 18 months later, saying he would rather \"suffer martyrdom in Israel than fight extradition through an unjust U.S. court system.\" Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas official in Gaza, then threatened the United States if Mousa were extradited. Wishing to avoid terrorist retaliation, Israel withdrew its extradition request on April 3, 1997. Mousa was thereupon deported to Jordan on May 6, 1997. In August 1999, Jordanian authorities closed the Hamas office in Amman and, on September 22, arrested Mousa and two of his fellow Hamas members. Mousa, who was reportedly holding Yemeni citizenship and both Egyptian and Palestinian travel documents, was again deported. ***Emad", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:129:64e950c826ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8683, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "top Hamas official in Gaza, then threatened the United States if Mousa were extradited.

An engineer, he became overall leader of Hamas after the arrest of Mohammed Mousa in 1995. However, in early 1996 he reportedly had less control over all elements of Hamas than Mousa had had. He was based mainly in Damascus, from where he made trips to Teheran. ***Mohammed Dief*** **Position:** Al-Qassam leader. **Background:** Mohammed Dief is believed to have assumed command of the military brigades of Hamas (Al-Qassam) following the death of Yahya Ayyash (\"The Engineer\"), who was killed on January 5, 1996. Dief reportedly leads from a small house on the Gaza Strip, although he is known to travel frequently to both Lebanon and Syria. He is currently among the most wanted by Israeli authorities. ***Al-Jihad Group*** (a.k.a.: al-Jihad, Islamic Jihad, New Jihad Group, Vanguards of the Conquest, Tala'i' al-Fath) **Group Profile** The al-Jihad Organization of Egypt, also known as the Islamic Group, is a militant offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, an anti-Western Islamic organization that has targeted Egyptian government officials for assassination since its founding in 1928. In 1981 Sheikh 'Umar Abd al-Rahman (also known as Omar Abdel Rahman), al-Jihad's blind theologian at the University of Asyut, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, sanctioning the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. In 1981 more than half of al-Jihad's membership were students or teachers from vocational centers and at least eight universities. However, some of the 302 al-Jihad members arrested in December 1982 for coup-plotting in the wake of Sadat's assassination included members of the Air Force military intelligence, Army central headquarters, the Central Security Services, and even the Presidential Guard. Others included employees at strategic jobs in broadcasting, the telephone exchange, and municipal services. Since 1998 there has been a change in the declared policy of the Al-Jihad group. In addition to its bitter ideological conflict with the \"heretical\" Egyptian government, the organization began calling for attacks against American and Israeli targets. Nassar Asad al-Tamini of the Islamic Jihad, noting the apparent ease with which biological weapons can be acquired, has suggested using them against Israel. In the eyes of the al-Jihad group, the United States and Israel are the vanguard of a worldwide campaign to destroy Islam and its believers, with the help of the current Egyptian government.

In the eyes of the al-Jihad group, the United States and Israel are the vanguard of a worldwide campaign to destroy Islam and its believers, with the help of the current Egyptian government. This changed attitude was the result of, among other things, the Egyptian al-Jihad's joining the coalition of Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organizations led by the Afghans. The collaboration between the Egyptian organizations and Al-Qaida played a key role in the formation of Osama bin Laden's \"Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders.\" Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Jihad's leader, who was sentenced in absentia to death or to life imprisonment on April 18, 1999, is a close associate of Osama bin Laden and one of the founders of the \"Islamic Front for Jihad against the Crusaders and the Jews.\" The movement basically seeks to challenge the West on an Islamic basis and establish an Islamic caliphate. However, the goals of the various al-Jihad groups differ in regard to the Palestinian issue. Islamic Jihad wants to liberate Palestine. Others give priority to establishing an Islamic state as a prerequisite for the liberation of Palestine. Islamic Jihad is very hostile toward Arab and Islamic regimes, particularly Jordan, which it considers puppets of the imperialist West. In the spring of 1999, the Islamic Group's leadership and governing council announced that it was giving up armed struggle. Whether that statement was a ruse remains to be seen. The social background of the al-Jihad remains unclear because the group has never operated fully in public. By the mid-1990s, intellectuals occupied important positions in the leadership of the al-Jihad movements in both Jordan and the Occupied Territories, where it is a powerful force in the unions of engineers, doctors, and students. Their power among workers continues to be weak. **New Religious Groups** ***Aum Shinrikyo*** **Group/Leader Profile** The investigation into the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995, opened a window on Shoko Asahara's cult, Aum Shinrikyo. In 1995 Aum Shinrikyo claimed to have 10,000 supporters in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. Whereas doomsday cults previously had carried out mass suicides, Aum Shinrikyo set itself apart from them by inflicting mass murder on the general public. What seems most remarkable about this apocalyptic cult is that its leading members include Japan's best and brightest: scientists, computer experts, lawyers and other highly trained professionals. But according to cult expert Margaret Singer of the University of California at Berkeley, these demographics are not unusual. \"Cults actively weed out the stupid and the psychiatric cases and look for people who are lonely, sad, between jobs or jilted,\" she says. Many observers also suggest that inventive minds turn to Aum Shinrikyo as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:131:f0de4c8d26b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8685, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "most remarkable about this apocalyptic cult is that its leading members include Japan's best and brightest: scientists, computer experts, lawyers and other highly trained professionals. But according to cult expert Margaret Singer of the University of California at Berkeley, these demographics are not unusual. \"Cults actively weed out the stupid and the psychiatric cases and look for people who are lonely, sad, between jobs or jilted,\" she says. Many observers also suggest that inventive minds turn to Aum Shinrikyo as an extreme reaction against the corporate-centered Japanese society, in which devotion to one's job is valued over individual expression and spiritual growth. Japan's school system of rote memorization, in which individualism and critical thinking and analysis are systematically suppressed, combined with crowded cities and transportation networks, have greatly contributed to the proliferation of cults in Japan, and to the growth of Aum Shinrikyo in particular. Aum Shinrikyo is one of at least 180,000 minor religions active in Japan. There is general agreement that the discipline and competitiveness required of Japan's education system made Aum Shinrikyo seem very attractive to bright university graduates. It provided an alternative life-style in which recruits could rebel against their families, friends, and \"the system.\" Numerous Aum Shinrikyo members were arrested on various charges after the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995. According to Manabu Watanabe, none of them claimed innocence; rather, many of them confessed their crimes and showed deep remorse. \"These people were proven to be sincere and honest victims of Asahara, the mastermind,\" Watanabe comments. Aum Shinrikyo became active again in 1997, when the Japanese government decided not to ban it. In 1998 Aum Shinrikyo had about 2,000 members, including 200 of the 380 members who had been arrested. The story of Aum Shinrikyo is the story of Shoko Asahara, its charismatic and increasingly psychopathic leader. Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, was born in 1955, the fourth son of a poor weaver of *tatami* mats, in the small rural village of Yatsushiro on Japan's main southern island of Kyushu. Afflicted with infantile glaucoma, he was blind in one eye and had diminished vision in the other. At age six, he was sent to join his blind older brother at a government-funded boarding school for the blind. Because he had limited vision in one eye, however, he soon developed influence over the blind students, who would pay him for services such as being a guide. Already at that early age, he exhibited a strong tendency to dominate people. His activities as a violence-prone, judo-proficient con artist and avaricious bully had earned him the fear of his classmates, as well as $3,000, by the time he graduated from high school in 1975. After graduation, Asahara established a lucrative acupuncture clinic in Kumamoto.

His activities as a violence-prone, judo-proficient con artist and avaricious bully had earned him the fear of his classmates, as well as $3,000, by the time he graduated from high school in 1975. After graduation, Asahara established a lucrative acupuncture clinic in Kumamoto. However, his involvement in a fight in which several people were injured forced him to leave the island for Tokyo in 1977. His stated ambitions at the time included serving as supreme leader of a robot kingdom and even becoming prime minister of Japan. In Tokyo he again found work as an acupuncturist and also attended a prep school to prepare for the highly competitive Japanese college entrance examinations, which he nevertheless failed. He also began taking an interest in religion, taught himself Chinese, and studied the revolutionary philosophy of Mao Zedong. In the summer of 1977, Asahara met Tomoko Ishii, a young college student; they married in January 1978, and the first of their six children was born in 1979. In 1978 Asahara opened a Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture clinic southeast of Tokyo and reportedly earned several hundred thousand dollars from the business. In 1981 he joined a new religion called Agon Shu, known for its annual Fire Ceremony and fusing of elements of Early Buddhism, Tantric Buddhism, and Hindu and Taoist yoga. In 1982 he was arrested and convicted for peddling fake Chinese cures and his business collapsed as a result. Bankrupted, Asahara reportedly earned nearly $200,000 from a hotel scam that year. In 1984 Asahara quit Agon Shu and, with the help of a few followers who also left Agon Shu, created a yoga training center called Aum, Inc. By the mid-1980s, the center had more than 3,000 followers, and in 1985 Asahara began promoting himself as a holy man. After a spiritual voyage through the Himalayas, he promoted himself as having mystical powers and spiritual bliss. Beginning in 1986, Aum Shinrikyo began a dual system of membership: ordained and lay. Ordained members had to donate all their belongings, including inheritances, to Aum. Many resisted, and a total of 56 ordained members have been reported as missing or dead, including 21 who died in the Aum Shinrikyo clinic. In early 1987, Asahara managed to meet the Dalai Lama. Asahara's megalomania then blossomed. In July 1987, he renamed his yoga schools, which were nonreligious, Aum Supreme Truth (Aum Shinri Kyo) and began developing a personality cult. The next year, Asahara expanded his vision to include the salvation not only of Japan but the world. By the end of 1987, Aum Shinrikyo had 1,500 members concentrated in several of Japan's major cities. **Shoko Asahara** (Photo courtesy of *Reuters*/Ho/Archive) In 1988 Aum Shinrikyo began recruiting new members, assigning only attractive and appealing members as recruiters.

It found a fertile recruitment ground in Japan's young, college-educated professionals in their twenties and early thirties from college campuses, dead-end jobs, and fast-track careers. Systematically targeting top universities, Aum Shinrikyo leaders recruited brilliant but alienated young scientists from biology, chemistry, engineering, medical, and physics departments. Many, for example, the computer programmers, were \"techno-freaks\" who spent much of their time absorbed in comics and their computers. Aum Shinrikyo also enlisted medical doctors to dope patients and perform human experiments. The first young Japanese to be free of financial pressures, the Aum Shinrikyo recruits were wondering if there was more to life than job security and social conformity. However, as Aum Shinrikyo members they had no need to think for themselves. According to David Kaplan and Andrew Marshall, \"The high-tech children of postindustrial Japan were fascinated by Aum's dramatic claims to supernatural power, its warnings of an apocalyptic future, its esoteric spiritualism.\" Aum's hierarchy had been influenced by Japanese animated movies, cyberpunk fiction and science fiction, virtual reality machines, and computer games. For example, Aum Shinrikyo used Isaac Asimov's classic sci-fi epic in the Foundation Series as a high-tech blueprint for the millennium and beyond. Indeed, Asahara modeled himself on Hari Seldon, the key character in the Foundation Series. The fictional Seldon is a brilliant mathematician who discovers \"psychohistory,\" the science of true prediction, and attempts to save humanity from apocalypse by forming a secret religious society, the Foundation, that can rebuild civilization in a millennium. To do this, Seldon recruits the best minds of his time, and, once a hierarchy of scientist-priests is established, they set about preserving the knowledge of the universe. Like Asimov's scientists in the Foundation Series, Asahara preached that the only way to survive was to create a secret order of beings armed with superior intellect, state-of-the-art technology, and knowledge of the future. To retain its membership, Aum Shinrikyo used mind-control techniques that are typical of cults worldwide, including brutal forms of physical and psychological punishment for various minor transgressions. New members had to terminate all contacts with the outside world and donate all of their property to Aum. This policy outraged the parents of Aum Shinrikyo members. In addition, in 1989 Aum Shinrikyo began to use murder as a sanction on members wishing to leave the sect. In July 1989, Aum Shinrikyo became more public when Asahara announced that Aum Shinrikyo would field a slate of 25", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:134:8bda1ec3c38f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8688, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 135, "text": "including brutal forms of physical and psychological punishment for various minor transgressions.

In addition, in 1989 Aum Shinrikyo began to use murder as a sanction on members wishing to leave the sect. In July 1989, Aum Shinrikyo became more public when Asahara announced that Aum Shinrikyo would field a slate of 25 candidates, including Asahara, in the next election of the lower house of the Japanese parliament. To that end, Aum Shinrikyo formed a political party, Shinrito (Turth Party). All of the Aum Shinrikyo candidates were young professionals between the ages of 25 and 38. In addition, Aum Shinrikyo finally succeeded in getting official recognition as an official religion on August 15, 1989, on a one-year probationary basis. In the political arena, however, Aum Shinrikyo was a total failure. Its bizarre campaign antics, such as having its followers dance about in front of subway stations wearing huge papier-mché heads of Asahara, dismayed the public, which gave Aum Shinrikyo a resounding defeat in the 1990 parliamentary elections (a mere 1,783 votes). This humiliation, it is believed, fueled Asahara's paranoia, and he accused the Japanese government of rigging the voting. Following this public humiliation, Asahara's darker side began to emerge. He began asking his advisers how they might set off vehicle bombs in front of their opponents' offices, and in March 1990, he ordered his chief chemist, Seiichi Endo, to develop a botulin agent. Beginning that April, when Aum Shinrikyo sent three trucks into the streets of Tokyo to spray poisonous mists, Asahara began to preach a doomsday scenario to his followers and the necessity for Aum Shinrikyo members to militarize and dedicate themselves to protecting Aum Shinrikyo against the coming Armageddon. That April, an Aum Shinrikyo team sprayed botulin poison on the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka outside Tokyo, where the U.S. 7th Fleet docked, but the botulin turned out to be a defective batch. To prevent its dwindling membership from falling off further, Aum Shinrikyo began to forcefully prevent members from leaving, and to recruit abroad. The group's efforts in the United States were not successful; in the early 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo had only a few dozen followers in the New York City area.. By late 1992, Asahara was preaching that Armageddon would occur by the year 2000, and that more than 90 percent of Japan's urban populations would be wiped out by nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction. Apparently, Asahara's plan was to develop the weapons of mass destruction needed for making this Armageddon a reality. In 1992 Aum Shinrikyo began purchasing businesses on a worldwide scale. It set up dummy companies, primarily in Russia and the United States, where its investments served as covers to purchase technology, weapons,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:135:c61c49af514f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8689, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 136, "text": "would occur by the year 2000, and that more than 90 percent of Japan's urban populations would be wiped out by nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction.

It set up dummy companies, primarily in Russia and the United States, where its investments served as covers to purchase technology, weapons, and chemicals for its weapons program. During 1992-94, Aum Shinrikyo recruited a number of Russian experts in weapons of mass destruction. Aum's Russian followers included employees in Russia's premier nuclear research facility, the I.V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, and the Mendeleyev Chemical Institute. Aum's chemical weapons efforts were more successful than its nuclear efforts. After the Gulf War, Aum's scientists began work on sarin and other related nerve agents. Aum Shinrikyo found that it could recruit at least one member from almost any Japanese or Russian agency or corporation and turn that recruit into its own agent. For example, in late 1994 Aum Shinrikyo needed access to sensitive military secrets held by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) compound in Hiroshima, so Aum Shinrikyo member Hideo Nakamoto, an MHI senior researcher, obtained MHI uniforms, and Yoshihiro Inoue recruited and converted three paratroopers from the 1st Airborne Brigade, an elite Japanese paratrooper unit. Nakamoto then escorted Inoue and the three paratroopers, wearing MHI uniforms, into the high-security facility, where they downloaded megabytes of restricted files on advanced weapons technology from MHI's mainframe. Other sites raided by the squad included the laser-research lab of NEC, Japan's top computer manufacturer, and the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka . Aum's membership lists included more than 20 serving and former members of the Self-Defense Forces. Aum's sarin attacks were carried out by highly educated terrorists. Aum's minister of science and technology, Hideo Murai, an astrophysicist, led the cult's first sarin attack in the mountain town Matsumoto on June 27, 1994, by releasing sarin gas near the apartment building in which the judge who had ruled against the cult lived. The attack killed seven people and poisoned more than 150 others. Robert S. Robbins and Jerrold M. Post note that: \"In 1994 Asahara made the delusional claim that U.S. jets were delivering gas attacks on his followers, a projection of his own paranoid psychology. Asahara became increasingly preoccupied not with surviving the coming war but with starting it.\" That year, Asahara reorganized Aum, using Japan's government as a model (see Table 7). Table 7.

Brackett, *Holy Terror: Armageddon * *in Tokyo*. New York: Weatherhill, 1996, 104. The five Aum Shinrikyo terrorists who carried out the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995, included Ikuo Hayashi, 48, head of Aum's Ministry of Healing (aka Medical Treatment Ministry). The other four were all vice ministers of Aum's Ministry of Science and Technology and included: Masato Yokoyama, 31, an applied-physics graduate; Kenichi Hirose, 30, who graduated at the top of his class in applied physics at the prestigious Waseda University; Yasuo Hayashi, 37, an electronics engineer; and Toru Toyoda, a physicist. Although no motive has been established for Asahara's alleged role in the nerve-gas attacks, some observers suggest that the Tokyo subway attack might have been revenge: all the subway cars struck by the sarin converged at a station beneath a cluster of government offices. Adding credence to this view, Ikuo Hayashi, a doctor who admitted planting gas on one of the Tokyo trains, was quoted in newspapers as saying the goal was to wipe out the Kasumigaseki section of Tokyo, where many government offices are located. \"The attack was launched so that the guru's prophecy could come true,\" Hayashi reportedly told interrogators. Shoko Egawa, an Aum Shinrikyo critic who has authored at least two books on the cult, observed that Aum Shinrikyo members made no attempt at reviewing the propriety of their own actions during the trial. When their own violations were being questioned, they shifted to generalities, and spoke as if they were objective third parties. Their routine tactics, she notes, included shifting stories into religious doctrine and training, making an issue out of a minor error on the part of the other party, evading the main issue, and feigning ignorance when confronted with critical facts. Authorities arrested a total of 428 Aum Shinrikyo members, and thousands of others quit. The government also stripped Aum Shinrikyo of its tax-exempt status and declared it bankrupt in 1996. Nevertheless, Aum Shinrikyo retained its", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:137:0b45784d8e52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8691, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 138, "text": "they were objective third parties.

Nevertheless, Aum Shinrikyo retained its legal status as a sect and eventually began to regroup. In 1998 its computer equipment front company had sales of $57 million, and its membership had risen to about 2,000. In December 1998, Japan's Public Security Investigation Agency warned in its annual security review that the cult was working to boost its membership and coffers. \"Aum is attempting to re-enlist former members and step up recruiting of new members nationwide. It is also initiating advertising campaigns and acquiring necessary capital,\" the report said. **Key Leader Profiles** ***Yoshinobu Aoyama*** **Position:** Aum's minister of justice. **Background:** Yoshinobu Aoyama was born in 1960. The son of a wealthy Osaka family, he graduated from Kyoto University Law School, where he was the youngest person in his class to pass the national bar exam. He joined Aum Shinrikyo in 1988 and within two years was its chief counsel. He was arrested in 1990 for violation of the National Land Law, and after being released on bail, he involved himself in an effort to prove his innocence. As Aum's attorney, he led its successful defense strategy of expensive countersuits and legal intimidation of Aum Shinrikyo critics. According to Kaplan and Marshall, \"He had longish hair, a robotlike delivery, and darting, nervous eyes that made it easy to underestimate him.\" He was arrested on May 3, 1995. According to Shoko Egawa, Aoyama's foremost traits during his trial included shifting responsibility and changing the story; speaking emotionally and becoming overly verbose when advocating Aum Shinrikyo positions, but speaking in a completely unemotional voice and making a purely perfunctory apology when addressing a case of obvious violation of the law; engaging in a lengthy dissertation on religious terms; deploying extended empty explanations and religious theory until the listener succumbed to a loss of patience and forgot the main theme of the discussion; deliberately shifting away from the main discussion and responding in a meandering manner to upset the questioner; resorting to counter-questioning and deceiving the other party by refusing to answer and pretending to explain a premise; and showing a complete absence of any remorse for having served the Aum Shinrikyo cult. ***Seiichi Endo*** **Position:** Minister of Health and Welfare. **Background:** Seiichi Endo, born in 1960, was Aum's health and welfare minister. As a graduate student in biology at Kyoto University, he did experiments in genetic engineering at the medical school's Viral Research Center.

As a graduate student in biology at Kyoto University, he did experiments in genetic engineering at the medical school's Viral Research Center. Provided with a small but well-equipped biolab by Aum, he conducted research in biological warfare agents, such as botulism and the Ebola virus. In March 1990, three weeks after voters rejected 25 Aum Shinrikyo members running for legislative office, Endo and three others went on a trip to collect starter botulinum germs on the northern island of Hokkaido, where Endo had studied as a young man. In late 1993, Asahara also assigned Endo the task of making sarin nerve gas. In a 1994 speech made in Moscow, he discussed the use of Ebola as a potential biological warfare agent. Endo produced the impure sarin that was used for the Tokyo subway attack on March 20, 1995. He was arrested on April 26, 1995, and publicly admitted his role in the sarin attacks in the town of Matsumoto on June 27, 1994, and Tokyo on March 20, 1995. ***Kiyohide Hayakawa*** **Position:** Asahara's second in command and minister of construction. **Background:** A key senior Aum Shinrikyo member, Kiyohide Hayakawa was born in 1949 in Osaka. He was active in leftist causes in the 1960s and during college. He received a master's degree in environmental planning from Osaka University in 1975. He worked in various architecture firms until 1986, when he joined the Aum's precursor group and soon distinguished himself as director of the Aum's Osaka division. Beginning in 1990, he masterminded Aum's attempt to arm itself and promoted its expansion into Russia. After becoming second in command, he spent a lot of time in Russia developing contacts there for the sect's militarization program. During 1992-95, he visited Russia 21 times, spending more than six months there. His visits to Russia became monthly between November 1993 and April 1994. His captured notebooks contain numerous references to nuclear and seismological weapons. Hayakawa participated in the murder of an Aum Shinrikyo member and the family of Attorney Tsutsumi Sakamoto, 33, a tenacious Aum Shinrikyo critic, in 1995. He was arrested on April 19, 1995. ***Dr. Ikuo Hayashi*** **Position:** Aum's minister of healing. **Background:** Ikuo Hayashi, born in 1947, was the son of a Ministry of Health official. He graduated from Keio University's elite medical school, and studied at Mount Sinai Hospital in the United States before joining the Japanese medical system. Handsome and youthful looking, he was a respected doctor and head of cardiopulmonary medicine at a government hospital just outside Tokyo. His behavior changed after an automobile accident in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:139:f569d2ce7183", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8693, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "on April 19, 1995. ***Dr. Ikuo Hayashi*** **Position:** Aum's minister of healing. **Background:** Ikuo Hayashi, born in 1947, was the son of a Ministry of Health official. He graduated from Keio University's elite medical school, and studied at Mount Sinai Hospital in the United States before joining the Japanese medical system. Handsome and youthful looking, he was a respected doctor and head of cardiopulmonary medicine at a government hospital just outside Tokyo. His behavior changed after an automobile accident in April 1988, when he fell asleep while driving a station wagon and injured a mother and her young daughter. Despondent, he, along with his wife, an anesthesiologist, joined Aum, whereupon he began treating his patients bizarrely, using Aum Shinrikyo techniques. Forced to resign from his hospital position, Dr. Hayashi was put in charge of Aum's new clinic in Tokyo, where patients tended to live only long enough to be brainwashed and to sign over their property to Aum, according to Kaplan and Marshall. Hayashi was also appointed Aum's minister of healing. Kaplan and Marshall report that \"he coldly presided over the wholesale doping, torture, and death of many followers.\" His activities included using electric shocks to erase memories of 130 suspicious followers. He participated in the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway March 20, 1995. Arrested on April 8, 1995, Hayashi was sentenced to life in prison on May 26, 1998, for spraying sarin in the Tokyo subway. In trial witness testimony on November 27, 1998, he said that he felt a dilemma over the crimes that he committed because they clashed with his social values, but he used Aum Shinrikyo doctrines to convince himself. Hayashi claimed he followed Asahara's order to commit murders not only out of fear that if he had disobeyed he would have been killed, but also out of a belief that Asahara had some religious power, that he had the God-like ability to see through a person's past, present, and future. Ikuo allegedly abandoned his faith in Asahara. ***Yoshihiro Inoue*** **Position:** Aum's minister of intelligence. **Background:** Yoshihiro Inoue was born in 1970, the son of a salaried minor official. Kaplan and Marshall describe him as \"a quiet boy of middling intelligence who devoured books on Nostradamus and the supernatural.\" While a high school student in Kyoto, he attended his first Aum Shinrikyo seminar. He became Aum's minister of intelligence and one of its \"most ruthless killers,\" according to Kaplan and Marshall. Unlike other Aum Shinrikyo leaders, Inoue lacked a university degree, having dropped out of college after several months to dedicate his life to Aum, which he had joined as a high school junior. He was so dedicated to Asahara that he declared that he would kill his parents if Asahara ordered it. Inoue was also so articulate, persuasive, and dedicated that, despite his unfriendly face--lifeless black eyes, frowning mouth, and pouting, effeminate lips--he was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:140:1c4313d0f969", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8694, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 141, "text": "killers,\" according to Kaplan and Marshall. Unlike other Aum Shinrikyo leaders, Inoue lacked a university degree, having dropped out of college after several months to dedicate his life to Aum, which he had joined as a high school junior. He was so dedicated to Asahara that he declared that he would kill his parents if Asahara ordered it. Inoue was also so articulate, persuasive, and dedicated that, despite his unfriendly face--lifeless black eyes, frowning mouth, and pouting, effeminate lips--he was able to recruit 300 monks and 1,000 new believers, including his own mother and many Tokyo University students. His captured diaries contain his random thoughts and plans concerning future Aum Shinrikyo operations, including a plan to conduct indiscriminate nerve gas attacks in major U.S. cities, including New York City. In the spring of 1994, Inoue attended a three-day training program run by the former KGB's Alpha Group outside Moscow, where he learned some useful tips on skills such as kidnapping, murder, and so forth. That summer he became Aum's minister of intelligence, a position that he used as a license to abduct runaway followers, kidnap potential cash donors to the cult, torture Aum Shinrikyo members who had violated some regulation, and steal high-technology secrets. That year, Inoue and Tomomitsu Niimi were ordered to plan a sarin and VX gas attack on the White House and the Pentagon. Beginning on December 28, 1994, Inoue led the first of numerous penetrations of the high-security compound of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) in Hiroshima to pilfer weapons secrets. He was arrested on May 15, 1995, when police stopped his car at a roadblock outside of Tokyo. During his trial, he allegedly abandoned his faith in Asahara. ***Hisako Ishii*** **Position:** Aum's minister of finance. **Background:** Hisako Ishii was born in 1960. She joined Aum's yoga classes in 1984, when she was an \"office lady\" at a major Japanese insurance company. One of Asahara's most devoted disciples, she became Aum's minister of finance and was behind the group's business success. She was also his inseparable mistress, until she gave birth to twins. At her trial, Ishii spoke of her childhood fear of death, the fact that adults failed to initially reply to her questions concerning death, the fact that she trusted Asahara with pure feelings, and her determination to mature as a person within the Aum Shinrikyo framework. She then proceeded to speak of changes which took place after her arrest: When I experienced a total collapse of the past more than 10 years during which I had matured within the cult as a religious person, I felt I had died. When all that I had believed I had accomplished within myself was destroyed, and I came to the awareness that all was just a fantasy of Asahara imbued in me, that he is not a true religious being, that he is not a guru, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:141:d4242ba755fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8695, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "took place after her arrest: When I experienced a total collapse of the past more than 10 years during which I had matured within the cult as a religious person, I felt I had died. When all that I had believed I had accomplished within myself was destroyed, and I came to the awareness that all was just a fantasy of Asahara imbued in me, that he is not a true religious being, that he is not a guru, and that the Aum Shinrikyo doctrine was wrong, I experienced a form of death separate from the death of a physical being. Ishii proceeded to read books banned by the Aum, such as religious books, books on mind-control, and psychology. She testified that as a result she had been resurrected through the process of learning the nature of genuine religion. Despite being impressed by the eloquence of her written statement, Shoko Egawa was dismayed by Ishii's total omission of anything about her feelings for the victims who literally met death as the result of the many crimes committed by the Aum. Although charged with relatively minor offenses, such as concealment of criminals and destruction of evidence, Ishii asserted that she was innocent of each of the charges. She depicted herself merely as an innocent victim taken advantage of by Asahara and stressed her determination to resurrect herself despite all the suffering. She not only refused to testify about her inside knowledge of cult affairs, she cut off any questions of that nature. In May 1998, Ishii announced her resignation from the Aum. ***Fumihiro Joyu*** **Position:** Aum's minister of foreign affairs. **Background:** Fumihiro Joyu joined Aum Shinrikyo in 1989 at age 26. He had an advanced degree in telecommunications from Waseda University, where he studied artificial intelligence. He quit his promising new career at Japan's Space Development Agency after only two weeks because it was incompatible with his interests in yoga. He became the sect's spokesman and minister of foreign affairs. As Aum's Moscow chief, Joyu ran the cult's large Moscow center at Alexseyevskaya Square. \"Joyu didn't try to hide his contempt for his poor Russian flock,\" Kaplan and Marshall write. They describe him as \"a mini-guru, a cruel and arrogant man who later proved to be Aum's most accomplished liar.\" They add: \"...fluent in English, Joyu was looked upon by most Japanese as a dangerously glib and slippery operator with the ability to lie in two languages.\" However, with his charismatic, boyish good looks he developed admirers among teenage girls from his appearances on television talk shows. He was arrested on October 7, 1995, on perjury charges. He was scheduled to be released from prison at the end of 1999. He has remained devout to Asahara, and was planning to rejoin the Aum Shinrikyo cult. ***Takeshi Matsumoto*** **Position:** An Aum Shinrikyo driver. **Background:** Born in 1966, Takeshi Matsumoto joined Aum Shinrikyo", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:142:39797bbf2fb1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8696, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "ability to lie in two languages.\" However, with his charismatic, boyish good looks he developed admirers among teenage girls from his appearances on television talk shows.

He has remained devout to Asahara, and was planning to rejoin the Aum Shinrikyo cult. ***Takeshi Matsumoto*** **Position:** An Aum Shinrikyo driver. **Background:** Born in 1966, Takeshi Matsumoto joined Aum Shinrikyo after telling his parents that he had seen hell. Personable but pathetic, he had dreams of becoming a Grand Prix auto racer. He drove the rental car used to kidnap Kiyoshi Kariya, 68, a notary public whose sister was a runaway Aum Shinrikyo member. Aum Shinrikyo members tortured and murdered Kariya after he refused to reveal his sister's whereabouts. National Police identified Matsumoto from fingerprints on the car rental receipt and put him on their \"most-wanted\" list. His fingerprints were the legal pretext long sought by the National Police to raid Aum Shinrikyo compounds and offices. While on the run, Matsumoto had Dr. Hayashi surgically remove all of his fingerprints and do some abortive facial plastic surgery as well. However, he was arrested in October 1995 and identified by his palm prints. He pleaded guilty to the abduction and confinement of Kariya. ***Hideo Murai*** **Position:** Aum's minister of science and technology, minister of distribution supervision, and \"engineer of the apocalypse.\" **Background:** Hideo Murai was born in 1954. After graduating from the Physics Department at Osaka University, he entered graduate school, where he studied X-ray emissions of celestial bodies, excelled at computer programming, and earned an advance degree in astrophysics. In 1987 he joined Kobe Steel and worked in research and development. After reading one of Asahara's books, he lost interest in his career. After a trip to Nepal, he quit Kobe Steel in 1989 and, along with his wife, enlisted in a six-month training course at an Aum Shinrikyo commune, where his life style turned ascetic and focused on Asahara's teachings. He quickly rose through the ranks because of his brilliant scientific background, self-confidence, boldness, and devotion to Asahara. He created such devices as the Perfect Salvation Initiation headgear (an electrode-laden shock cap), which netted Aum Shinrikyo about $20 million, and the Astral Teleporter and attempted unsuccessfully to develop a botulinus toxin as well as nuclear, laser, and microwave weapons technology. In early 1993, Asahara ordered him to oversee Aum's militarization program. \"Widely recognized and feared within Aum, Murai,\" according to Brackett, \"had a reputation as a determined and aggressive leader who liked to stir up trouble for other people.\" He was directly involved in the murder of the Sakamotos and at least one Aum Shinrikyo member. He led the team that attacked judges' apartments in Matsumoto with sarin gas in June 27, 1994, in which seven people were killed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:143:a459f64b8aa5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8697, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "technology.

He led the team that attacked judges' apartments in Matsumoto with sarin gas in June 27, 1994, in which seven people were killed and 144 injured. Murai also masterminded the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995. David Kaplan and Andrew Marshall describe \"the cult's deceptively unassuming science chief\" as follows: \"At first glance, Murai looked more like a provincial schoolteacher than a mad scientist. He had elfin features etched on a perfectly round face, with a fragile build that suggested he could do harm to no one. But a closer look revealed eyes that turned from benign to beady in a blink. His hair was short but disheveled, and he often looked lost in some unreachable thought.\" Just before he was to be brought in by police for questioning, Murai was stabbed with a butcher's knife by a Korean gangster on April 23, 1995, on prime-time TV in front of Aum's Tokyo headquarters, and he died six hours later. ***Kiyohide Nakada*** **Position:** Vice Minister, Ministry of Home Affairs. **Background:** Nakada was born in 1948. He is described as having a shiny, shaven head, clipped mustache, and piercing eyes. His distinguishing feature, which is characteristic of a Japanese *yakuza*, or mobster, is a brilliant tattoo stretching from his neck to his calf. For years, he headed a gang affiliated with the Yamaguchi crime syndicate in the city of Nagoya. When he was serving three years in prison on a firearms charge, his wife joined Aum. Although Nakada disapproved of her joining Aum, he himself turned to Aum Shinrikyo when a doctor gave him three months to live because of a failing liver. After a miraculous recovery, he joined Aum, dissolved his gang, and donated his assets to Aum. Nakada became one of Asahara's two former *yakuza* conduits to the underworld. When Aum Shinrikyo began its militarization program in 1994, he became particularly important in obtaining weapons. He eventually became Tomomitsu Niimi's deputy in Aum's Ministry of Home Affairs, charged with enforcing security within the organization. As head of the Action Squad, he was responsible for abducting and killing defecting sect members and opponents of Aum. He was arrested in April 1995. ***Tomomasa Nakagawa*** **Position:** Head of Aum's Household Agency. **Background:** Dr. Tomomasa Nakagawa, 29, an Aum Shinrikyo physician, is alleged to have murdered Satoko Sakamoto, 29, and her infant son with injections of potassium chloride, in 1995. Nakagawa joined Aum Shinrikyo while a medical student at Kyoto Prefectural College of Medicine in February 1988.

Nakagawa joined Aum Shinrikyo while a medical student at Kyoto Prefectural College of Medicine in February 1988. After passing the national medical exam in April 1988 and practicing medicine for a year, he moved into an Aum Shinrikyo commune in August 1989. As head of the Aum's Household Agency, one of his primary duties was to act as personal doctor to Asahara and his family. He was also actively involved in Aum's sarin production. ***Tomomitsu Niimi*** **Position:** Aum's minister of home affairs. **Background:** Tomomitsu Niimi was born in 1964. As a university student, he read law, as well as the works of Nostradamus and esoteric Buddhist texts. After graduation, he worked at a food company but quit six months later to join Aum. Kaplan and Marshall describe him as \"a slender figure with a long neck, shaven head, and a reptilian smirk that seemed permanently etched upon his face.\" As Aum's ferocious minister of home affairs, Niimi presided over Aum's mini-police state. His 10-member hit squad, the New Followers Agency, engaged in spying on, abducting, confining, torturing, and murdering runaway members. He is described by Kaplan and Marshall as Aum's \"chief hit man\" and a sadistic and ruthless head of security. He allegedly participated in various murders and abductions, including the murder of Shuji Taguchi in 1989, the slaying of the Sakamoto family, and the strangling of a pharmacist in January 1994. In February 1994, he was accidentally exposed to some sarin and lapsed into convulsions, but Dr. Nakagawa was able to save him. In the spring of 1994, he attended a three-day training course conducted by veterans of the former KGB's Alpha Group near Moscow. That year, Niimi and Yoshihiro Inoue were ordered to plan a sarin and VX gas attack on the White House and the Pentagon. On September 20, 1994, Niimi and his hit squad attacked Shoko Egawa, author of two books on Aum, with phosgene gas, but she survived. In January 1995, Niimi sprayed Hiroyuki Nakaoka, head of a cult victims' support group, with VX, but he survived after several weeks in a coma. Niimi also participated in the Tokyo subway attack on March 20, 1995. He was arrested on April 12, 1995. He has remained devout to Asahara. ***Toshihiro Ouchi*** **Position:** An Aum Shinrikyo operative. **Background:** Ouchi joined the Aum Shinrikyo cult in 1985. Physically large and a long-time Aum Shinrikyo member, Ouchi functioned primarily as a leader of cult followers. Many of the followers and ordained priests of the cult with whom he had been personally associated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:145:6c75990975b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8699, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "several weeks in a coma.

Physically large and a long-time Aum Shinrikyo member, Ouchi functioned primarily as a leader of cult followers. Many of the followers and ordained priests of the cult with whom he had been personally associated became involved in crimes, and many remain active cult followers. Ouchi was indicted for involvement in two incidents. One case took place in February 1989, and involved the murder of cult follower Shuji Taguchi, who was making an attempt to leave the cult; the second case involved the destruction of a corpse of a cult follower who had passed away during religious training in June 1993. Ouchi's reluctant behavior gave Asahara doubts about his commitment; hence, he condemned Ouchi as a \"cancerous growth on the Aum,\" assigning him to the Russian chapter in September 1993. Nevertheless, Ouchi continued to serve as an executive cult follower. He recruited new followers in Russia and provided guidance to them. During the investigation of the Sakamoto case that began in March 1995, Ouchi was alarmed when he learned that the Aum Shinrikyo was involved. The knowledge undermined his religious beliefs. He reportedly was shocked when he later received a letter from a former cult follower, who was an intimate friend, that discussed the misguided doctrine of Aum. His faith in Aum Shinrikyo shaken, he gradually began to alter his views about people outside the cult. In early April 1995, Russian police arrested Ouchi, who had been serving as Fumihiro Joyu's deputy in Moscow. Kaplan and Marshall report that Ouchi, \"a grinning naf,\" was described by one academic as \"knowing as much about Russia as the farthest star.\" During his initial trial in Japan, Ouchi expressed repentance and apologized \"as a former official of the Aum.\" ***Masami Tsuchiya*** **Position:** Head of Aum's chemical-warfare team. **Background:** Masami Tsuchiya was born in 1965. Prior to joining Aum, Tsuchiya was enrolled in a five-year doctoral degree program in organic physics and chemistry at Tsukuba University, one of the top universities in Japan, where his graduate work focused on the application of light to change the structure of molecules. Although described by a professor as \"brilliant,\" Tsuchiya lived in a barren room, was introverted, had no social life, and expressed a desire to become a priest. Tsuchiya abandoned a career in organic chemistry to join Aum. After suggesting that Aum Shinrikyo produce a Nazi nerve gas called sarin, he was given his own lab (named Satian 7) with 100 workers and a vast chemical plant to develop chemical weapons. As Aum's chief chemist and head of its chemical-warfare team, he played a central role in Aum's manufacture of sarin.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:146:95d952905484", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8700, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 147, "text": "a barren room, was introverted, had no social life, and expressed a desire to become a priest.

As Aum's chief chemist and head of its chemical-warfare team, he played a central role in Aum's manufacture of sarin. Kaplan and Marshall describe Tsuchiya as looking the part of the mad scientist: \"His goatee and crew-cut hair framed a broad face with eyebrows that arched high above piercing eyes.\" Fascinated by Russia's chemical weapons stockpiles, Tsuchiya spent at least three weeks in Russia in 1993, where he is suspected of meeting with experts in biochemical weapons. When he returned to his Mount Fuji lab in the fall of 1993, he began experimenting with sarin, using a Russian formula. He was prepared to build a vast stockpile of nerve agents, such as sarin, blister gas, and others. Although poorly trained workers, leaks of toxic fumes, and repeated setbacks plagued the program, Tsuchiya succeeded in stockpiling 44 pounds of sarin at Satian 7 by mid-June 1994. However, Kaplan and Marshall point out that he was not the only Aum Shinrikyo chemist to make the nerve gas. Tsuchiya also produced other chemical-warfare agents such as VX. He had Tomomitsu Niimi, using a VX syringe, test the VX on several unsuspecting individuals. Police arrested Tsuchiya on April 26, 1995. He has remained devout to Asahara. **TABLES** **Table 1.

A number of the would-be mujahideen (*q.v.*), or Islamic resistance fighters, who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s and early 1990s later applied the skills and contacts acquired during the Afghan War and its aftermath to engage in terrorist activities elsewhere. The Afghans also transmitted the knowledge they acquired to a new generation of Muslim militants in countries as different as Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, and the Philippines. This new breed of Afghan terrorists, who operate independently of state sponsors, draws on global funding, is savvy about modern weapons and explosives, and is able to take advantage of the most up-to-date means of communication and transportation. Whereas Muslim terrorists were cloistered by nationality prior to the Afghan War, after the war they began working together--Pakistanis, Egyptians, Algerians, and so forth. Al-Qaida's Afghan component is also known as the Armed Islamist Movement (AIM). Assassins--From the eleventh through the thirteenth century, a sect of Shiite Muslims called the Assassins used assassination as a tool for purifying the Muslim religion. The Assassins' victims, who were generally officials, were killed in public to communicate the error of the targeted official. By carrying out the assassination in public, the Assassin would allow himself to be apprehended and killed in order to demonstrate the purity of his motives and to enter Heaven. Baader-Meinhof Gang--Journalistic name for the Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Fraktion--RAF) (*q.v.*). Although the RAF had been reduced to fewer than 20 members by the early 1990s, it may still exist in an inactive status. If so, it would be in at least its second generation of leadership. The group's support network, reportedly involving hundreds of Germans, many of whom are well-educated professionals, helps to account for its possible survival. fundamentalism--This term is used to refer to people who dedicate their lives to pursuing the fundamentals of their religion. cult--A journalistic term for an unorthodox system of religious beliefs and ritual that scholars of religion refrain from using. fight or flight--A theory developed by W.B. Cannon in 1929. When an individual is under stress, the heart rate increases, the lungs operate more efficiently, adrenalin and sugar are released into the bloodstream, and the muscles become infused with blood.

Cannon in 1929. When an individual is under stress, the heart rate increases, the lungs operate more efficiently, adrenalin and sugar are released into the bloodstream, and the muscles become infused with blood. Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis--An hypothesis that every frustration leads to some form of aggression and every aggressive act results from some prior frustration. As defined by Ted Robert Gurr: \"The necessary precondition for violent civil conflict is relative deprivation, defined as actors' perception of discrepancy between their value expectations and their environment's apparent value capabilities. This deprivation may be individual or collective.\" Groupthink--As originally defined by I.L. Janis, \"a mode of thinking that people engage in when the members' strivings for unanimity override the motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.\" guerrilla--A revolutionary who engages in insurgency as opposed to terrorism, although guerrillas also use terrorist methods. Usually operating relatively openly in less-developed countries, guerrillas attempt to hold territory and generally attack the state's infrastructure, whereas terrorists usually operate in urban areas and attack more symbolic targets. Guerrillas usually coerce or abduct civilians to join them, whereas terrorists are highly selective in whom they recruit. international terrorism--Although the Central Intelligence Agency distinguishes between international and transnational terrorism (international being terrorism carried out by individuals or groups controlled by a sovereign state and transnational terrorism being terrorism carried out by autonomous nonstate actors), the distinction is not used in this paper. This is because the distinction is unnecessarily confusing, not self-evident, and lacking in usefulness, whereas the term \"state-sponsored terrorism\" is self-evident and unambiguous. Moreover, one would have to be extremely well informed to know which terrorist acts are state-sponsored. Thus, the term international terrorism is used here to refer to any act of terrorism affecting the national interests of more than one country. The WTC bombing, for example, was an act of international terrorism because its perpetrators included foreign nationals. Intifada--The uprising by Palestinians begun in October 1987 against Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Also the name of the involved Liberation Army of Palestine, a loosely organized group of adult and teenage Palestinians active in 1987-93 in attacks on armed Israeli troops. Their campaign for self-determination included stone-throwing and petrol bombing. Some 1,300 Palestinians and 80 Israelis were killed in the uprising up to the end of 1991. jihad--An Arabic verbal noun derived from *jahada* (\"to struggle\"). Although \"holy war\" is not a literal translation, it summarizes the essential idea of jihad. In the course of the revival of Islamic fundamentalism (*q.v.*), the doctrine of jihad has been invoked to justify resistance, including terrorist actions, to combat \"un-Islamic\" regimes, or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9909intelreport.txt:151:9c4d4216c689", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8705, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9909intelreport.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9909intelreport", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "Israeli troops.

Although \"holy war\" is not a literal translation, it summarizes the essential idea of jihad. In the course of the revival of Islamic fundamentalism (*q.v.*), the doctrine of jihad has been invoked to justify resistance, including terrorist actions, to combat \"un-Islamic\" regimes, or perceived external enemies of Islam, such as Israel and the United States. June Second Movement--An anarchistic leftist group formed in West Berlin in 1971 that sought to resist the liberal democratic establishment in West Berlin through bombings, bank robberies, kidnappings, and murders. The group was named after the anniversary of Benno Ohnejorg's death, who was killed in a demonstration against the visiting Shah of Iran in Berlin on June 2,1967. The group was closely associated with the Red Army Faction (*q.v*.) and after the majority of its members had been arrested by the end of the 1970s, the remainder joined the RAF. mindset--A noun defined by *American Heritage Dictionary* as: \"1. A fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person's response to and interpretation of situations; 2. an inclination or a habit.\" *Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary* (10th ed.) defines it as 1. A mental attitude or inclination; 2. a fixed state of mind. The term dates from 1926 but apparently is not included in dictionaries of psychology. mujahideen--A general designation for Muslim fighters engaged in jihad, as well as the name of various Muslim political and paramilitary groups, such as the Afghan (*q.v.*) Mujahideen. personality--The distinctive and characteristic patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that define an individual's personal style of interacting with the physical and social environment. psychopath--A mentally ill or unstable person, especially one having a psychopathic personality (*q.v.*), according to *Webster's*. psychopathy--A mental disorder, especially an extreme mental disorder marked usually by egocentric and antisocial activity, according to *Webster's*. psychopathology--The study of psychological and behavioral dysfunction occurring in mental disorder or in social disorganization, according to *Webster's*. psychotic--Of, relating to, or affected with psychosis, which is a fundamental mental derangement (as schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lost contact with reality, according to *Webster's*. Red Army Faction--The RAF, formerly known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, was a group of German anarchistic leftist terrorists active from May 11, 1972, to the early 1990s.

All five people listed on the flight manifest -- Mr. Stewart; his agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan; and pilots Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue -- were killed, officials said. A sixth person, a golf course designer from North Palm Beach, was also believed to have died on the plane, according to his employer, Nicklaus Design. Jack Nicklaus said Monday that Bruce Borland, 40, was flying to Texas because he wanted to design a course with Mr. Stewart under the Nicklaus Design banner. Authorities could not confirm that Mr. Borland was on the plane, and officials at the crash site said they could not tell exactly how many people had been killed. No one on the ground was hurt. Flight controllers frantically tried to contact the Lear 35 by radio, and a series of military jets scrambled to chase the plane as it streaked along, guided by its auto-pilot system until the fuel supply finally ran out. Capt. Kevin Bakke of the South Dakota Highway Patrol said he watched for three or four minutes as the plane sped across the sky, followed by two military jets. Then a deputy thought he saw a parachute, but it was the plane plummeting toward the ground, Capt.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:991026dallasmorningnews.txt:0:9aa1a5b92344", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8719, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "991026dallasmorningnews.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "991026dallasmorningnews", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "contact the Lear 35 by radio, and a series of military jets scrambled to chase the plane as it streaked along, guided by its auto-pilot system until the fuel supply finally ran out. Capt. Kevin Bakke of the South Dakota Highway Patrol said he watched for three or four minutes as the plane sped across the sky, followed by two military jets. Then a deputy thought he saw a parachute, but it was the plane plummeting toward the ground, Capt. Bakke said. \"It fell out of the sky,\" he said. \"There was no glide to it.\" Investigators said everything they know so far about the flight is consistent with hypoxia, the condition caused by a lack of oxygen that leads to confusion and ultimately to death. \"We figure these guys were dead for most of the trip,\" one source said. The last contact with the plane came near Gainesville, Fla., when one of the pilots spoke with flight controllers in Jacksonville, according to a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. But there was no hint of trouble until the Lear failed to turn west over Florida's panhandle for its flight into Dallas Love Field. Mr. Stewart, 42, decided to stop in Dallas to meet with developers building a golf course near the Dallas North Tollway in Frisco that would carry Mr. Stewart's name. Mr. Stewart, who played golf at Southern Methodist University before beginning his successful professional career in 1979, was en route from his home in Orlando to Houston, site of this week's Tour Championship. It is the Professional Golfers Association's final tournament of the year for its top 30 money winners. \"It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over the death of Payne Stewart,\" said PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem in a statement issued from PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. \"This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image of professional golf.\" Fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf, in Houston practicing for the Tour Championship, told KTRH-AM that he considered turning around and going home when he heard the news. \"He's an irreplaceable guy, not just for his playing record,\" Mr. Waldorf said. Mr. Stewart was among the best-known players on the professional tour, in large part because of his distinctive sartorial style. In a sea of baggy khakis, Mr. Stewart was singularly elegant in his trademark knickers and snappy English-style caps.

Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of those who gathered Monday outside the family's home. \"He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and somehow in his death,\" Mr. Henry said. \"That brought a great sense of peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.\" Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, Chelsea, 13, and Aaron, 10. The Learjet that carried Mr. Stewart and his party was operated and managed by Sunjet Aviation of Stanford, Fla. It was manufactured in 1976 and had made roughly 7,500 flights, company officials said. All required maintenance was current, the officials said. Determining just what went wrong could be very difficult because the plane was completely destroyed at impact, investigators said. The Learjet 35, a light twin-turbofan business jet that can carry eight passengers and a crew of two, is equipped with an oxygen system for emergency use, with masks for the crew and each passenger. It also has a depressurization warning system. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be looking for anything that might explain how the plane could have lost oxygen without triggering the alarm or anyone noticing. If the plane rapidly lost pressurization for some reason, all the occupants would have had masks to wear until the plane reached a lower altitude. But if the oxygen system malfunctioned, the passengers could have been slowly starved of oxygen, causing hypoxia. That condition provides only subtle signs, beginning with a feeling of well-being or giddiness. Within a few minutes, confusion sets in, followed by unconsciousness and death. Such losses of cabin pressure are rare in private aircraft, experts said, but there have been similar cases. In 1980, newly named Louisiana State University football coach Robert \"Bo\" Rein died when a private plane veered 1,000 miles off course at extremely high altitudes and then plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. The flight was supposed to go from Shreveport to Baton Rouge. The plane crashed off the coast of Virginia.

The flight was supposed to go from Shreveport to Baton Rouge. The plane crashed off the coast of Virginia. And in 1988, a Learjet bound for Addison Airport from Memphis, Tenn., overflew its target by hundreds of miles, crashing in Mexico. In both crashes, officials blamed hypoxia. Mina resident Lesley Braun, who lives about two miles from the crash site, said her husband saw the plane carrying Mr. Stewart spiraling down. \"The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,\" Mrs. Braun said. \"There's not a lot of debris spread out a long ways.\" The force of the crash compressed the plane to roughly the size of a large pickup truck. The only part clearly recognizable as a piece of aircraft was the tail cone, resting atop the wreckage. \"If you didn't know it was a crash site, you'd think you stumbled across a trash pile,\" said Capt. Bakke of the highway patrol. The plane crashed in a field that was once wetlands, and Capt. Bakke said it's possible parts of the wreckage are buried 15 to 20 feet deep. At a news conference Monday, President Clinton said he was profoundly sorry about the death of Mr. Stewart and the others who died in the crash. \"It's a very sad day,\" he said. \"I am very grateful for the work the FAA did and for the two Air Force pilots and the others in the Air Force that monitored this plane and made every effort to try to make contact with it. \"They did everything that could humanly be done, and they were looking out for the safety of everyone involved.\" There was some speculation Monday that the military jets were prepared to shoot down the Lear if it threatened to crash in a heavily populated area. But officials at the Pentagon strongly denied that possibility. Shooting down the plane \"was never an option,\" Air Force spokesman Capt. Joe Della Vedova said. \"I don't know where that came from.\" **Instead, according to an Air Force timeline, a series of military planes provided an emergency escort to the stricken Lear, beginning with a pair of F-16 Falcons from the Air National Guard at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., about 20 minutes after ground controllers lost contact. ** An F-16 and an A-10 Warthog attack plane from Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., took up the chase a few minutes later and were trailing the Lear when it climbed abruptly from 39,000 to 44,000 feet at 9:52 a.m. CDT.

Fifteen minutes later, the F-16 intercepted the Lear, the pilot reporting no movement in the cockpit. At 10:44 a.m., the fighters from Eglin diverted to St. Louis for fuel. Fifteen minutes later, four Air National Guard F-16s from Tulsa, Okla., took up the chase, accompanied by a KC-135 refueling tanker. F-16s from Fargo, N.D., later scrambled to intercept the Lear jet, too. At noon Dallas time, the Fargo F-16s reported that the windows of the jet were fogged with ice and there was no evidence anyone was piloting the plane. At 12:14, the Lear jet began to spiral. It crashed about six minutes later. Staff writers Terri Langford, Kathy Lewis and Richard Whittle and the Associated Press contributed to this report. Note that on 9/11 the military claims it could not intercept four huge airliners, the last of which was known to be off course for over an hour. This is a strange claim considering Payne Stewart's jet was intercepted in 20 minutes with only a relatively small number of people in the FAA and air force involved, when on 9/11 the entire FAA and military apparatus were focused on this huge event.

Pentagon officials said that the recollections of several officials involved in the \"Able Danger\" data-mining operation \"were not accurate\" and that a chart they said included a blurry image of Atta and his name never existed. The report concluded that there were no efforts to prevent contact between the Pentagon group and the FBI. The investigation began after members of Congress raised concerns over reports that Navy Capt. Scott Philpott and Army Reserve Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer remembered seeing Atta's photograph on documents collected by the intelligence program, and that the commission investigating the attacks had ignored their assertions. The assertions gained considerable steam when Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) said...that, two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, he presented White House officials with a chart that depicted people affiliated with al-Qaeda, including lead hijacker Atta. **\"I am appalled that the DoD IG would expect the American people to actually consider this a full and thorough investigation,\" Weldon said. \"I question their motives and the content of the report, and I reject the conclusions they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:abledanger911.txt:0:7c4e8333b61d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8725, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "abledanger911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "abledanger911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "attacks had ignored their assertions.

Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and J.D. Smith were among a dozen intelligence officers and contractors who worked on the clandestine program set up long before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to track al-Qaida. They are accusing the Pentagon...of violating their First Amendment rights by blocking their access to legal counsel during the closed sessions. \"Able Danger identified the Sept. 11, 2001, attack leader Mohamed Atta, and three of the 9/11 plot's 19 hijackers, as possible members of an al-Qaida cell linked to the 1993 World Trade Center attack or its participants,\" the suit said. **Shaffer, a Bronze Star recipient who fought undercover in Afghanistan, caused a stir in August when he stepped forward to say that he and other Able Danger operatives had identified Atta as long as 21 months before the Sept. 11 attacks.

Recent revelations from the military intelligence operation code-named \"Able Danger\" have cast light on a missed opportunity that could have potentially prevented 9/11. Specifically, Able Danger concluded in February 2000 that military experts had identified Mohamed Atta by name...as an al Qaeda agent operating in the U.S. Subsequently, military officers assigned to Able Danger were prevented from sharing this critical information with FBI agents. Why? The Able Danger intelligence, if confirmed, is undoubtedly the most relevant fact of the entire post-9/11 inquiry. Even the most junior investigator would immediately know that the name and photo ID of Atta in 2000 is precisely the kind of tactical intelligence the FBI has many times employed to prevent attacks and arrest terrorists. **Yet the 9/11 Commission inexplicably concluded that it \"was not historically significant.\" This astounding conclusion--in combination with the failure to investigate Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission's credibility and, if the facts prove out, might just render the commission historically insignificant itself.** **Note:** This amazingly blunt article is written by former FBI Director Louis Freeh!

The alleged infractions by Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, 42, include obtaining a service medal under false pretenses, improperly flashing military identification while drunk and stealing pens, according to military paperwork shown by his attorney to The Associated Press. Shaffer was one of the first to publicly link Sept. 11 leader Mohamed Atta to the unit code-named Able Danger.

But he said the meeting was canceled after Pentagon lawyers concluded that information on suspected Al Qaeda operatives with ties to the U.S. might violate Pentagon prohibitions on retaining information on \"U.S. persons,\" a term that includes U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens.

Anthony Shaffer and Navy Capt. Scott Phillpott, claimed a classified military intelligence unit, known as \"Able Danger,\" identified Atta before the attacks.

But they have been unable to find the chart or other evidence that it existed. On Thursday, four intelligence officials provided the first extensive briefing for reporters on the outcome of their interviews with people associated with Able Danger and their review of documents. They said they interviewed at least 80 people over a three-week period and found three, besides Philpott and Shaffer, who said they remember seeing a chart that either mentioned Atta by name as an al-Qaida operative or showed his photograph. Four of the five recalled a chart with a pre-9/11 photo of Atta; the other person recalled only a reference to his name. **The intelligence officials said they consider the five people to be credible but their recollections are still unverified.

On a U.S. government most-wanted list established under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, however, he was named in June as an international kingpin. The list names him as the top heroin dealer in Afghanistan -- and one of the biggest in the world. He also is among the key beneficiaries of a massive rise in drug cultivation in Afghanistan described Thursday in a report by the United Nations, which says production of opium and its derivative, heroin, has rocketed to near record levels. The discouraging numbers have highlighted the simmering discontentment among hardliners in the Bush administration with anti-drug efforts by Britain, which was assigned the lead in stamping out the Afghan opium trade after the U. S.-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001. \"In Afghanistan, drugs are now a clear and present danger,\" said Antonio Maria Costa, director of the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime, on the release of the 2004 Afghanistan opium survey. \"The fear that Afghanistan might degenerate into a narco-state is becoming a reality.\" Opium poppy cultivation, the U.N. report says, has risen by two-thirds, compared with last year, to more than 320,000 acres -- more than 10 times the area of San Francisco. The harvest in 2004 was estimated at 4,200 metric tons, an increase of 17 percent from last year. A metric ton equals about 2, 205 pounds. The report shows that the drug trade has been rising steadily for decades -- except for an abrupt one-year decline in opium poppy cultivation in 2001 that followed a ban imposed by the Taliban regime. \"The drug problem in Afghanistan has been allowed to become ever more serious. If it persists, the political and military successes of the last three years will be lost,\" the report warned. Since 95 percent of Afghan heroin ends up in Europe, U.S. interest in foreign drug kingpins traditionally has focused on Latin America. But the report says Afghanistan has surpassed Colombia as the world's biggest gross producer of illicit narcotics, heroin being the \"main engine of economic growth\" and the \"strongest bond\" among tribes that previously fought constantly. Until now, \"narco-sheikhs\" such as Noorzai have been virtually unknown outside their war-torn fiefdoms. But their days of peaceful criminal obscurity may be at an end. In a move that signals a new front in its worldwide drug war, the Bush administration hopes to extradite Noorzai and up to a dozen other drug lords", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:afghanistandrugcapital.txt:1:da1a59b29c78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8743, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "afghanistandrugcapital.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "afghanistandrugcapital", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the world's biggest gross producer of illicit narcotics, heroin being the \"main engine of economic growth\" and the \"strongest bond\" among tribes that previously fought constantly.

In a move that signals a new front in its worldwide drug war, the Bush administration hopes to extradite Noorzai and up to a dozen other drug lords as part of an \"urgent\" strike against Afghanistan's spiraling $2.8 billion-a- year heroin trade. \"We are interested in getting people like these indicted and then extradited to the U.S.,\" said one senior Kabul-based U.S. official. \"It sends out a very strong message to the others that no matter how rich and powerful they are, there is a risk attached to what they do.\" Yet the extradition move, which requires the permission of newly elected President Hamid Karzai, is sensitive. \"What we have here now is a narco-economy where 40 to 50 percent of the GDP is from illicit drugs,\" said the Kabul-based official. \"The heroin traffickers are naturally interested in supporting terrorism and doing what they can to destabilize the central government because the last thing they want is the establishment of the rule of law. In those terms, it is a matter of national security to the U.S. and Europe.\" Officially, both U.S. and British diplomats insist that just as in the war on terror, Washington and London see exactly eye to eye on drug eradication. But at a House International Relations Committee hearing in February, a senior Bush administration official accused Britain of being squeamish about eradicating opium poppy fields before Afghan farmers had found other means of income. \"Our priority should not be some kind of misplaced sympathy for someone who will have to do a little bit more work to grow other, less-lucrative crops, such as wheat or barley,\" said Robert Charles, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement. British officials believe the more robust U.S. approach, which also may involve crop-dusting raids, could simply alienate the very farmers they are trying to win over, by putting the stick too far ahead of the carrot. They also complain that the 18,000-strong U.S. military in Afghanistan has turned a blind eye to warlords' involvement in the opium trade in exchange for help against al Qaeda and Taliban remnants. But with the U.N. report confirming Charles' misgivings by revealing a massive rise in opium cultivation, the United States now seems set to steal the lead from Britain by targeting the narco-sheikhs directly. \"We need to turn this thing around quickly,\" said the Kabul-based official. \"It may take 10 or 20 years to completely eradicate it, but we definitely need some success in the next year or two.\" Britain has trained a squad of elite counternarcotics", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:afghanistandrugcapital.txt:2:3507639e9a8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8744, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "afghanistandrugcapital.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "afghanistandrugcapital", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Qaeda and Taliban remnants.

The Afghan justice system, which is being rebuilt by Italian officials experienced in dealing with the Mafia, still lacks the necessary investigation teams, secure jails and witness protection programs to begin prosecutions in earnest. Haji Juma Khan, another kingpin accused by U.S. officials of funding al Qaeda, still freely travels between his homes in Afghanistan and Pakistan and regularly visits Dubai, where he has extensive investments. \"Plenty of Afghans will tell you that he is a big player, but getting proof that will stand up in court is another matter,\" said one official. U.S. troops arrested Khan two years ago during the hunt for Osama bin Laden, only to release him -- a decision they now bitterly regret.

In a sense, matter and antimatter are the yin and yang of reality: Every type of subatomic particle has its antimatter counterpart. But when matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate each other in an immense burst of energy. **During the Cold War, the Air Force funded numerous scientific studies of the basic physics of antimatter.** With the knowledge gained, some Air Force insiders are beginning to think seriously about potential military uses -- for example, antimatter bombs small enough to hold in one's hand, and antimatter engines for 24/7 surveillance aircraft. More cataclysmic possible uses include a new generation of super weapons -- either pure antimatter bombs or antimatter-triggered nuclear weapons; the former wouldn't emit radioactive fallout.

Another possibility is antimatter- powered \"electromagnetic pulse\" weapons that could fry an enemy's electric power grid and communications networks, leaving him literally in the dark and unable to operate his society and armed forces. **Following an initial inquiry from The Chronicle this summer, the Air Force forbade its employees from publicly discussing the antimatter research program. Still, details on the program appear in numerous Air Force documents distributed over the Internet prior to the ban. ** These include an outline of a March 2004 speech by an Air Force official who, in effect, spilled the beans about the Air Force's high hopes for antimatter weapons. On March 24, Kenneth Edwards, director of the \"revolutionary munitions\" team at the Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida was keynote speaker at the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) conference in Arlington, Va. In that talk, Edwards discussed the potential uses of a type of antimatter called positrons. Physicists have known about positrons or \"antielectrons\" since the early 1930s, when Caltech scientist Carl Anderson discovered a positron flying through a detector in his laboratory. That discovery, and the later discovery of \"antiprotons\" by Berkeley scientists in the 1950s, upheld a 1920s theory of antimatter proposed by physicist Paul Dirac. In 1929, Dirac suggested that the building blocks of atoms -- electrons (negatively charged particles) and protons (positively charged particles) -- have antimatter counterparts: antielectrons and antiprotons. One fundamental difference between matter and antimatter is that their subatomic building blocks carry opposite electric charges. Thus, while an ordinary electron is negatively charged, an antielectron is positively charged (hence the term positrons, which means \"positive electrons\"); and while an ordinary proton is positively charged, an antiproton is negative. The real excitement, though, is this: If electrons or protons collide with their antimatter counterparts, they annihilate each other. In so doing, they unleash more energy than any other known energy source, even thermonuclear bombs. The energy from colliding positrons and antielectrons \"is 10 billion times ... that of high explosive,\" Edwards explained in his March speech. Moreover, 1 gram of antimatter, about 1/25th of an ounce, would equal \"23 space shuttle fuel tanks of energy.\" Thus \"positron energy conversion,\" as he called it, would be a \"revolutionary energy source\" of interest to those who wage war. **It almost defies belief, the amount of explosive force available in a speck of antimatter -- even a speck that is too small to see. For example: One millionth", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:antimatterweapons.txt:1:2b44b5ff491c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8748, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "antimatterweapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "antimatterweapons", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "... that of high explosive,\" Edwards explained in his March speech. Moreover, 1 gram of antimatter, about 1/25th of an ounce, would equal \"23 space shuttle fuel tanks of energy.\" Thus \"positron energy conversion,\" as he called it, would be a \"revolutionary energy source\" of interest to those who wage war. **It almost defies belief, the amount of explosive force available in a speck of antimatter -- even a speck that is too small to see. For example: One millionth of a gram of positrons contain as much energy as 37.8 kilograms (83 pounds) of TNT, according to Edwards' March speech. A simple calculation, then, shows that about 50-millionths of a gram could generate a blast equal to the explosion (roughly 4,000 pounds of TNT, according to the FBI) at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. ** Unlike regular nuclear bombs, positron bombs wouldn't eject plumes of radioactive debris. When large numbers of positrons and antielectrons collide, the primary product is an invisible but extremely dangerous burst of gamma radiation. Thus, in principle, a positron bomb could be a step toward one of the military's dreams from the early Cold War: a so-called \"clean\" superbomb that could kill large numbers of soldiers without ejecting radioactive contaminants over the countryside. A copy of Edwards' speech onNIAC's Web site emphasizes this advantage of positron weapons in bright red letters: \"No Nuclear Residue.\" But talk of \"clean\" superbombs worries critics. \" 'Clean' nuclear weapons are more dangerous than dirty ones because they are more likely to be used,\" said an e-mail from science historian George Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., author of \"Project Orion,\" a 2002 study on a Cold War-era attempt to design a nuclear spaceship. Still, Dyson adds, antimatter weapons are \"a long, long way off.\" Why so far off? One reason is that at present, there's no fast way to mass produce large amounts of antimatter from particle accelerators. With present techniques, the price tag for 100-billionths of a gram of antimatter would be $6 billion, according to an estimate by scientists at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and elsewhere, who hope to launch antimatter-fueled spaceships. Another problem is the terribly unruly behavior of positrons whenever physicists try to corral them into a special container. Inside these containers, known as Penning traps, magnetic fields prevent the antiparticles from contacting the material wall of the container -- lest they annihilate on contact. Unfortunately, because like-charged particles repel each other, the positrons push each other apart and quickly squirt out of the trap. If positrons can't be stored for long periods, they're as useless to the military as an armored personnel carrier without a gas tank. So Edwards is funding investigations of ways to make positrons last longer in storage.

So Edwards is funding investigations of ways to make positrons last longer in storage. Edwards' point man in that effort is Gerald Smith, former chairman of physics and Antimatter Project leader at Pennsylvania State University. Smith now operates a small firm, Positronics Research LLC, in Santa Fe, N.M. So far, the Air Force has given Smith and his colleagues $3.7 million for positron research, Smith told The Chronicle in August. Smith is looking to store positrons in a quasi-stable form called positronium. A positronium \"atom\" (as physicists dub it) consists of an electron and antielectron, orbiting each other. Normally these two particles would quickly collide and self-annihilate within a fraction of a second -- but by manipulating electrical and magnetic fields in their vicinity, Smith hopes to make positronium atoms last much longer. Smith's storage effort is the \"world's first attempt to store large quantities of positronium atoms in a laboratory experiment,\" Edwards noted in his March speech. \"If successful, this approach will open the door to storing militarily significant quantities of positronium atoms.\" **Officials at Eglin Air Force Base initially agreed enthusiastically to try to arrange an interview with Edwards. \"We're all very excited about this technology,\" spokesman Rex Swenson at Eglin's Munitions Directorate told The Chronicle in late July. But Swenson backed out in August after he was overruled by higher officials in the Air Force and Pentagon. ** **Reached by phone in late September, Edwards repeatedly declined to be interviewed. His superiors gave him \"strict instructions not to give any interviews personally. I'm sorry about that -- this (antimatter) project is sort of my grandchild. ... ** \"(But) I agree with them (that) we're just not at the point where we need to be doing any public interviews.\" Air Force spokesman Douglas Karas at the Pentagon also declined to comment last week. In the meantime, the Air Force has been investigating the possibility of making use of a powerful positron-generating accelerator under development at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. One goal: to see if positrons generated by the accelerator can be stored for long periods inside a new type of \"antimatter trap\" proposed by scientists, including Washington State physicist Kelvin Lynn, head of the school's Center for Materials Research. A new generation of military explosives is worth developing, and antimatter might fill the bill, Lynn told The Chronicle: \"If we spend another $10 billion (using ordinary chemical techniques), we're going to get better high explosives, but the gains are incremental because we're getting near the theoretical limits of chemical energy.\" **Besides, Lynn", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:antimatterweapons.txt:3:12877d2e55f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8750, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "antimatterweapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "antimatterweapons", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "for long periods inside a new type of \"antimatter trap\" proposed by scientists, including Washington State physicist Kelvin Lynn, head of the school's Center for Materials Research.

[national](http://www.scripps.com/taxonomy/term/160) By KEVIN CROWE and GUIDO H. STEMPEL III Scripps Howard News Service Friday, November 23, 2007 Nearly two-thirds of Americans think it is possible that some federal officials had specific warnings of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, but chose to ignore those warnings, according to a Scripps Howard News Service/Ohio University poll. A national survey of 811 adult residents of the United States conducted by Scripps and Ohio University found that more than a third believe in a broad smorgasbord of conspiracy theories including the attacks, international plots to rig oil prices, the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the government's knowledge of intelligent life from other worlds. The high percentage is a manifestation, some say, of an American public that increasingly distrusts the federal government. \"You wouldn't have gotten these numbers a year or two after the attacks themselves,\" said University of Florida law professor Mark Fenster. \"You've got an increasingly disaffected public that is unhappy with the administration.\" Fenster, author of the book \"Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture,\" attributed the high percentage in part to the findings of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (also called the 9/11 Commission), which concluded federal officials failed to prevent the attacks, but did not have specific knowledge of the date of the attacks. An earlier Scripps Howard/Ohio University survey, conducted in July 2006, revealed that more than one-third of Americans thought federal officials assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to stop them so the United States could go to war in the Middle East. \"What (the recent survey) could mean is that people are thinking that the Bush administration is incompetent, that there were warnings out there and they chose to put their attention on other things,\" Fenster said. At a time when the price of crude oil has neared $100 per barrel, 81 percent of Americans also said it was \"somewhat likely\" or \"very likely\" that oil companies conspire to keep the price of gasoline high. \"It shows that the oil companies are not trusted by a lot of people,\" said Tyson Slocum, director of the Energy Program of Public Citizen, the consumer watchdog organization founded by Ralph Nader. Record-breaking quarterly profits stir the pot, too. \"People look at the huge profits and put two and two together,\" he said. \"'Those high prices I'm paying are fueling those profits.'\" All the talk about oil and terror has distracted some of the believers in government cover-ups of UFOs. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they think it is \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" flying saucers are real and the government is hiding the truth about them.

Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they think it is \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" flying saucers are real and the government is hiding the truth about them. In a 1995 Scripps survey, 50 percent of Americans responded the same way to the same question. \"The kind of anxieties or mistrust of the government that might have been expressed as a belief in UFOs has shifted,\" said political science professor Jodi Dean. \"Now people are worried about things that are much realer to them.\" \"In both instances, it's a case of mistrusting government,\" she said. Dean, a professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York and author of \"Aliens in America: Conspiracy Cultures from Outerspace to Cyberspace,\" also said that the 50th anniversary of the 1947 Roswell, N.M., incident put more focus on the notion of a conspiracy. Dean said she expects the popularity of the theory to decline even further during the next few decades. But one decades-old theory continues to thrive. Forty-two percent of the American public still thinks some people in the federal government might have known about the assassination of Kennedy in advance. \"I'm amazed that it's as high as it is,\" said Vincent Bugliosi, whose 1,632-page book \"Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy\" was published in May. Bugliosi's book comes to the opposite conclusion: Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and he did it on his own. Bugliosi said he thinks a majority of Americans believe in some sort of conspiracy surrounding the assassination or the investigating Warren Commission, but most of the questions he has fielded on his book tour revolve around the suspicions of CIA or mob involvement. \"They believe in a conspiracy,\" he said, \"and I think (the survey) allowed them to express their beliefs.\" The survey was conducted by telephone Sept. 24 to Oct. 10 among 811 adult residents of the United States who were selected at random. The survey was conducted by the Scripps Survey Research Center at Ohio University under a grant from the Scripps Howard Foundation and has a margin of error of about 4 percent.

Investigators believe that the advisers' activities extended well beyond the secret arms sales to Iran and aid to the contras now under investigation. **Lt. Col.

The activities of those contacts were coordinated by the National Security Council, the officials and investigators said. **There appears to have been no formal directive for the advisers' activities, which knowledgeable sources described as a parallel government. ** ** In a secret assessment of the activities, the lead counsel for the Senate Iran-contra committee called it a \"secret government-within-a-government.\" **", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__parallel-government-870705.txt:0:3c6d7c1b6404", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8754, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__parallel-government-870705.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__parallel-government-870705", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "through secret contacts throughout the government with persons who acted at their direction but did not officially report to them.

The roles of top-level officials and of Reagan himself are still not clear. But that is expected to be a primary topic when North appears before the Iran-contra committees beginning Tuesday. Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh also is believed to be trying to prove in his investigation of the Iran-contra affair that government officials engaged in a criminal conspiracy.

Offer declined, officials say. **ACQUISITION** of stolen confidential briefing materials from Carter's campaign before Oct. 28, 1980, Carter-Reagan debate. ** PRINCIPALS ** William Clark: Allowed bigger North role at NSC. William Casey: Kept guard on President Carter **Advisers formed shadow government, probers say** Much of the time, Cabinet secretaries and their aides were unaware of the advisers' activities. When they periodically detected operations, they complained or tried to derail them, interviews show. But no one ever questioned the activities in a broad way, possibly out of a belief that the advisers were operating with presidential sanction, officials said.

But no one ever questioned the activities in a broad way, possibly out of a belief that the advisers were operating with presidential sanction, officials said. Reagan did know of or approve at least some of the actions of the secret group, according to previous accounts by aides, friends and high-ranking foreign officials. One such case is the 1985 visit to Libya by William Wilson, then-U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and a close Reagan friend, to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, officials said last week. Secretary of State George Shultz rebuked Wilson, but the officials said Reagan knew of the trip in advance. **The heart of the secret structure from 1983 to 1986 was North's office in the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, investigators believe. ** North's influence within the secret structure was so great, the sources said, that he was able to have the orbits of sophisticated surveillance satellites altered to follow Soviet ships around the world, call for the launching of high-flying spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and Nicaragua and become involved in sensitive domestic activities. ** Many initiatives ** Others in the structure included some of Reagan's closest friends and advisers, including former national security adviser William Clark, the late CIA Director William Casey and Attorney General Edwin Meese, officials and investigators said. Congressional investigators said the Iran deal was just one of the group's initiatives. They say exposure of the unusual arrangement may be the legacy of their inquiry. \"After we establish that a policy decision was made at the highest levels to transfer responsibility for contra support to the NSC..., we favor examining how that decision was implemented,\" wrote Arthur Liman, chief counsel of the Senate committee, in a secret memorandum to panel leaders Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Warren Rudman, R-N.H., before hearings began May 5. \"This is the part of the story that reveals the whole secret government-within-a-government, operated from the [Executive Office Building] by a Lt. Col., with its own army, air force, diplomatic agents, intelligence operatives and appropriations capacity,\" Limon wrote in the memo, parts of which were shared with The Herald. A spokesman for Liman declined comment but did not dispute the memo's existence. A White House official rejected the notion that any of Reagan's advisers were operating secretly. \"The president has constantly expressed his foreign policy positions to the public and has consulted with the Congress,\" the official said. ** Began in 1980 ** Congressional investigators and current and former officials interviewed - members of the CIA, State Department and Pentagon - said they still do not have a full record of the impact of the the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__parallel-government-870705.txt:2:659333f8e8fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8756, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__parallel-government-870705.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__parallel-government-870705", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "did not dispute the memo's existence.

One of the group's first acts was a meeting with a man claiming to represent Iran who offered to release the hostages to Reagan. Allen - Reagan's first national security adviser - and another campaign aide, Laurence Silberman, told *The Herald* in April of the meeting. They said McFarlane, then a Senate Armed Services Committee aide, arranged and attended it. McFarlane later became Reagan's national security adviser and played a key role in the Iran-contra affair. Allen and Silberman said they rejected the offer to release the hostages to Reagan. ** Briefing book theft ** **Congressional aides now link another well-known campaign incident - the theft of confidential briefing materials from Carter's campaign before the Oct. 28, 1980, Carter-Reagan debate - to the same group of advisers. ** They believe that Casey obtained the briefing materials and passed them to James Baker, another top Reagan campaign aide, who was White House chief of staff in Reagan's first term. Once Reagan was sworn in, the group moved quickly to set itself up, officials said. Within months, the advisers were clashing with officials in the traditional agencies. Six weeks after Reagan was sworn in, apparently over State Department objections, then-CIA director Casey submitted a proposal to Reagan calling for covert support of anti-Sandinista groups that had fled Nicaragua after the 1979 revolution. It is still unclear whether Casey cleared the plan with Reagan. But In November 1981 the CIA secretly flew an Argentine military leader, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, to Washington to devise a secret agreement under which Argentine military officers trained Nicaraguan rebels, according to an administration official familiar with the agreement. About the same time, North completed his transfer to the NSC from the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__parallel-government-870705.txt:3:214a9181bbd5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8757, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__parallel-government-870705.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__parallel-government-870705", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "to Reagan calling for covert support of anti-Sandinista groups that had fled Nicaragua after the 1979 revolution.

About the same time, North completed his transfer to the NSC from the Marine Corps. Those who worked with North in 1981 remember his first assignments as routine, although not unimportant. ** North, they recalled, was briefly assigned to carry the \"football,\" the briefcase containing the secret contingency plans for fighting a nuclear war, which is taken everywhere the president goes. North later widened his assignment to cover national crisis contingency planning. In that capacity he became involved with the controversial national crisis plan drafted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ** ** National crisis plan ** From 1982 to 1984, North assisted FEMA, the U.S. government's chief national crisis-management unit, in revising contingency plans for dealing with nuclear war, insurrection or massive military mobilization. **North's involvement with FEMA set off the first major clash between the official government and the advisers and led to the formal letter of protest in 1984 from then-Attorney General Smith. ** Smith was in Europe last week and could not be reached for comment. But a government official familiar with North's collaboration with FEMA said then-Director Louis O. Guiffrida, a close friend of Meese's, mentioned North in meetings during that time as FEMA's NSC contact. Guiffrida could not be reached for comment, but FEMA spokesman Bill McAda confirmed the relationship. \"Officials of FEMA met with Col. North during 1982 to 1984,\" McAda said. \"These meetings were appropriate to Col. North's duties with the National Security Council and FEMA's responsibilities in certain areas of national security.\" ** FEMA's clash with Smith occurred over a secret contingency plan that called for suspension of the Constitution, turning control of the United States over to FEMA, appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments and declaration of martial law during a national crisis. ** ** The plan did not define national crisis, but it was understood to be nuclear war, violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition against a military invasion abroad. ** ** Plan was protested ** The official said the contingency plan was written as part of an executive order or legislative package that Reagan would sign and hold within the NSC until a severe crisis arose. **The martial law portions of the plan were outlined in a June 30, 1982, memo by Guiffrida's deputy for national preparedness programs, John Brinkerhoff. A copy of the memo was obtained by *The Herald*. ** ** The scenario outlined in the Brinkerhoff memo resembled somewhat a paper Guiffrida had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__parallel-government-870705.txt:4:28b56067317f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8758, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__parallel-government-870705.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__parallel-government-870705", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "The official said the contingency plan was written as part of an executive order or legislative package that Reagan would sign and hold within the NSC until a severe crisis arose. **The martial law portions of the plan were outlined in a June 30, 1982, memo by Guiffrida's deputy for national preparedness programs, John Brinkerhoff. A copy of the memo was obtained by *The Herald*. ** ** The scenario outlined in the Brinkerhoff memo resembled somewhat a paper Guiffrida had written in 1970 at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., in which he advocated martial law in case of a national uprising by black militants. The paper also advocated the roundup and transfer to \"assembly centers or relocation camps\" of at least 21 million \"American Negroes.\" ** When he saw the FEMA plans, Attorney General Smith became alarmed. He dispatched a letter to McFarlane Aug. 2, 1984 lodging his objections and urging a delay in signing the directive. \"I believe that the role assigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the revised Executive Order exceeds its proper function as a coordinating agency for emergency preparedness,\" Smith said in the letter to McFarlane, which *The Herald* obtained. \"This department and others have repeatedly raised serious policy and legal objections to the creation of an 'emergency czar' role for FEMA.\" ** It is unclear whether the executive order was signed or whether it contained the martial law plans. Congressional sources familiar with national disaster procedures said they believe Reagan did sign an executive order in 1984 that revised national military mobilization measures to deal with civilians in case of nuclear war or other crisis. ** **[Editor's Note]** The fact that at least several parts of these plans were implemented shortly after 9/11 suggest that the executive order was signed and did contain martial law plans. ** Orchestrated news leaks ** Around the time that issue was producing fireworks with the administration, McFarlane and Casey reassigned North from national crisis planning to international covert management of the Contras. The transfer came after North took a personal interest, realizing that neither the State Department nor any other government agency wanted to handle the issue after it became clear early in 1984 that Congress was moving to bar official aid to the rebels. The new assignment, plus North's natural organizational ability, creativity and the sheer energy he dedicated to the issue, gradually led to an expansion of his power and stature within the covert structure, officials and investigators believe. [Attorney General] Meese also was said to have played a role in the secret government, investigators now believe, but his role is less clear. Meese sometimes referred private American citizens to the NSC so they could be screened and contacted for soliciting support for the Nicaraguan contras. One of those supporters, Philip Mabry of Fort Worth, told *The Herald* earlier this year that in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__parallel-government-870705.txt:5:a85d7541426f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8759, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__parallel-government-870705.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__parallel-government-870705", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "to an expansion of his power and stature within the covert structure, officials and investigators believe.

One of those supporters, Philip Mabry of Fort Worth, told *The Herald* earlier this year that in 1983 he was told by fellow conservatives in Texas to contact Meese, then White House counselor, if he wanted to help the Contras. After he contacted Meese's office, Mabry received a letter from Meese obtained by *The Herald* advising him that his name had been given to the \"appropriate people.\" Shortly thereafter, Mabry said, a woman who identified herself as Meese's secretary gave him the name and phone number of another NSC secretary who, in turn, gave him North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, as contacts. Meese's Justice Department spokesman, Patrick Korten, denies that Meese was part of North's secret contra supply network and notes that Meese does not recall having referred anyone to North on contra-related matters. ** In addition to North's role as contra commander and fund-raiser, North became secret overseer of the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy, through which the Reagan administration disseminated information that cast Nicaragua as a threat to its neighbors and the United States. ** An intelligence source familiar with North's relationship with that office said North was directly involved in many of the best publicized news leaks, including the Nov. 4, 1984, Election Day announcement that Soviet-made MiG jet fighters were on their way to Nicaragua. McFarlane is now believed to have been the senior administration official who told reporters that the Soviet cargo ship Bakuriani, en route to Nicaragua from a Soviet Black Sea port, was probably carrying MiGs. ** The intelligence official said North apparently recommended that the information be leaked to the press on Election Day so it would reach millions of people watching election results. CBS and NBC broadcast the report that night. ** ** Clark had key role ** The leak led to a new clash between the regular bureaucracy and the president's advisers. The official State Department spokesman, John Hughes, tried hard to play down the report, pointing out that it was unproven that the Bakuriani was carrying MiGs. At the same time, employees of the Office of Public Diplomacy, acting under North's direction, insisted that the crates were inside the ship and that MiGs were still a possibility. To take a closer look, the source said, North requested a high-flying SR-71 Blackbird spy aircraft be sent from Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., to fly over the Nicaraguan port of Corinto while the Bakuriani unloaded its cargo.

The pictures showed that the Bakuriani unloaded helicopters, not MiGs. **North was not the only adviser who operated outside traditional government channels, investigators have concluded. ** ** Others were known as the RIGLET, a semi-official unit made up of North; Alan Fiers, a CIA Central American affairs officer; and Elliott Abrams, the current assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, according to Abrams' subordinate Richard Melton**. Melton revealed the existence of the RIGLET in a deposition given to the Iran-contra committees. The name is a diminutive for RIG, which stands for Restricted Interagency Group. Among the RIGLET's actions was ordering the U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, Lewis Tambs, to assist the Contras in setting up a front in southern Nicaragua. Tambs, who resigned suddenly last year after his links to North were revealed, testified about the instructions to Iran-contra investigators. But perhaps the key to the parallel government was the role played by Reagan's second national security adviser, William Clark. It was during Clark's tenure that North began to gain influence in the NSC. Clark also recruited several midlevel officers from the Pentagon and the CIA to work on a special Central American task force in 1983 to push aid for El Salvador, a task force member said. \"Judge Clark was the granddaddy of the system,\" he said. \"I was working at the Pentagon on another issue when my boss said that because of special circumstances, I was to be reassigned to the task force.\" A former administration official familiar with Clark's activities said Clark also had approved contacts between Vatican Ambassador Wilson and Libya before Wilson's November 1985 journey, which came after McFarlane replaced Clark at the NSC. The former official said Wilson also had carried out secret missions for the Reagan administration in a Latin American country where Wilson reportedly maintained contacts with high-level officials. The source asked that the country not be identified because the system is still in place and had reduced tensions by circumventing the regular bureaucracies of both countries. Calls to Wilson's and Clark's offices in California were not returned.

One reason for this success has been its economic organization, [which] has passed through six successive stages, of which at least four are called \"capitalism.\" Three features are notable about this development as a whole. In the first place, each stage created the conditions which tended to bring about the next stage. The [first stage] of self-sufficient agrarian units (manors) was in a society organized so that its upper ranks-the lords, lay and ecclesiastical-found their desires for necessities so well met that they sought to exchange their surpluses of necessities for luxuries of remote origin. This gave rise to a trade in foreign luxuries (spices, fine textiles, fine metals) which was the first evidence of the stage of commercial capitalism. In this second stage, mercantile profits and widening markets created a demand for textiles and other goods which could be met only by application of power to production. This gave the third stage: industrial capitalism. The stage of industrial capitalism soon gave rise to such an insatiable demand for heavy fixed capital, like railroad lines, steel mills, shipyards, and so on, that these investments could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and investment banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief parts of the industrial system, since they provided capital to it. This gave rise to financial capitalism. **The control of financial capitalism was used to integrate the industrial system into ever-larger units with interlinking financial controls. This made possible a reduction of competition with a resulting increase in profits. As a result, the industrial system soon found that it was again able to finance its own expansion from its own profits, and, with this achievement, financial controls were weakened, and the stage of monopoly capitalism arrived. ** In this fifth stage, great industrial units, working together either directly or through cartels and trade associations, were in a position to exploit the majority of the people. The result was a great economic crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state-the minority hoping to use political power to defend their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority. Both hoped to use the power of the state to find some solution to the economic aspects of the crisis. This dualist struggle dwindled with the rise of economic and social pluralism after 1945. **A Depression Accompanies Transition to Various Stages** **The second notable feature of this whole development is that the transition of each stage to the next was associated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:1:81cca66fa80a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8765, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority.

This dualist struggle dwindled with the rise of economic and social pluralism after 1945. **A Depression Accompanies Transition to Various Stages** **The second notable feature of this whole development is that the transition of each stage to the next was associated with a period of depression or low economic activity. This was because each stage, after an earlier progressive phase, became later, in its final phase, an organization of vested interests more concerned with protecting its established modes of action than in continuing progressive changes by the application of resources to new, improved methods. This is inevitable in any social organization, but is peculiarly so in regard to capitalism.** **The Primary Goal of Capitalism** The third notable feature of the whole development is closely related to this special nature of capitalism. Capitalism provides very powerful motivations for economic activity because it associates economic motivations so closely with self-interest. But this same feature, which is a source of strength in providing economic motivation through the pursuit of profits, is also a source of weakness owing to the fact that so self-centered a motivation contributes very readily to a loss of economic coordination. Each individual, just because he is so powerfully motivated by self-interest, easily loses sight of the role which his own activities play in the economic system as a whole, and tends to act as if his activities *were *the whole, with inevitable injury to that whole. **Capitalism, because it seeks profits as its primary goal, is never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. Any of these may be achieved under capitalism, and any (or all) of them may he sacrificed and lost under capitalism, depending on this relationship to the primary goal of capitalist activity-the pursuit of profits. During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at various times, contributed both to the achievement and to the destruction of these other social goals.** **Commercial Capitalism** The different stages of capitalism have sought to win profits by different kinds of economic activities. The original stage, which we call commercial capitalism, sought profits by moving goods from one place to another. In this effort, goods went from places where they were less valuable to places where they were more valuable, while money, doing the same thing, moved in the opposite direction. This valuation, which determined the movement both of goods and of money and which made them move *in opposite directions, *was measured by the relationship between these two things. Thus the value of goods was expressed in money, and the value of money was expressed in goods.

Thus the value of goods was expressed in money, and the value of money was expressed in goods. Goods moved from low-price areas to high-price areas, and money moved from high-price areas to low-price areas, because goods were more valuable where prices were high and *money was more valuable where prices were low.* **Money and Goods Are Different** Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are, on the contrary, exactly opposite things. Most confusion in economic thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. **Goods are wealth which you have, while money is *a claim on wealth *which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt.** If goods are wealth; money is not wealth, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth. They always behave in opposite ways, just as they usually move in opposite directions. If the value of one goes up, the value of the other goes down, and in the same proportion. The value of goods, expressed in money, is called \"prices,\" while the value of money, expressed in goods, is called \"value.\" **The Rise of Commercial Capitalism** Commercial capitalism arose when merchants, carrying goods from one area to another, were able to sell these goods at their destination for a price which covered original cost, all costs of moving the goods, including the merchant's expenses, *and a profit. *This development, which began as the movement of luxury goods, increased wealth because it led to specialization of activities both in crafts and in agriculture, which increased skills and output, and also brought into the market new commodities. **The Development of Mercantilism** **Eventually, this stage of commercial capitalism became institutionalized into a restrictive system, sometimes called \"mercantilism,\" in which merchants sought to gain profits, not from the movements of goods but from restricting the movements of goods. Thus the pursuit of profits, which had earlier led to increased prosperity by increasing trade and production, became a restriction on both trade and production, because profit became an end in itself rather than an accessory mechanism in the economic system as a whole.** The way in which commercial capitalism (an expanding economic organization) was transformed into mercantilism (a restrictive economic organization) twice in our past history is very revealing not only of the nature of economic systems, and of men themselves, but also of the nature of economic crisis and what can be done about it. **Merchants Restrict Trade to Increase Profits** Under commercial capitalism, merchants soon discovered that an increasing flow of goods from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:3:1b6b217a1d38", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8767, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "mechanism in the economic system as a whole.** The way in which commercial capitalism (an expanding economic organization) was transformed into mercantilism (a restrictive economic organization) twice in our past history is very revealing not only of the nature of economic systems, and of men themselves, but also of the nature of economic crisis and what can be done about it. **Merchants Restrict Trade to Increase Profits** Under commercial capitalism, merchants soon discovered that an increasing flow of goods from a low-price area to a high-price area tended to raise prices in the former and to lower prices in the latter. Every time a shipment of spices came into London, the price of spices there began to fall, while the arrival of buyers and ships in Malacca gave prices there an upward spurt. This trend toward equalization of price levels between two areas because of the double, and reciprocal, movement of goods and money jeopardized profits for merchants, however much it may have satisfied producers and consumers at either end. It did this by reducing the price differential between the two areas and thus reducing the margin within which the merchant could make his profit. It did not take shrewd merchants long to realize that they could maintain this price differential, and thus their profits, if they could restrict the flow of goods, so that an equal volume of money flowed for a reduced volume of goods. In this way, shipments were decreased, costs were reduced, but profits were maintained. Two things are notable in this mercantilist situation. In the first place, the merchant, by his restrictive practices, was, in essence, increasing his own satisfaction by reducing that of the producer at one end and of the consumer at the other end; he was able to do this because he was in the middle between them. ln the second place, so long as the merchant, in his home port, was concerned with goods, he was eager that the prices of goods should be, and remain, high. **Merchants Became Concerned with Lending of Money** **In the course of time, however, some merchants began to shift their attention from the goods aspect of commercial interchange to the other, monetary, side of the exchange. They began to accumulate the profits of these transactions, and became increasingly concerned, not with the shipment and exchange of goods, but with the shipment and exchange of moneys.** In time they became concerned with the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and their activities, advancing money for both, at high interest rates, secured by claims on ships or goods as collateral for repayment. **The New Bankers Were Eager for High Interest Rates** In this process the attitudes and interests of these new bankers became totally opposed to those of the merchants (although few of either recognized the situation).

Where the merchant had been eager for high prices and was increasingly eager for low interest rates, the banker was eager for a high value of money (that is, low prices) and high interest rates. Each was concerned to maintain or to increase the value of the half of the transaction (goods for money) with which he was directly concerned, with relative neglect of the transaction itself (which was of course the concern of the producers and the consumers). **The Operations of Banking and Finance Were Concealed So** **They Appeared Difficult to Master** In sum, specialization of economic activities, by breaking up the economic process, had made it possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the process and, by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest. The process was not only broken up into producers, exchangers, and consumers but there were also two kinds of exchangers (one concerned with goods, the other with money), with almost antithetical, *short-term, *aims.The problems which inevitably arose could be solved and the system reformed only by reference to the system as a whole. Unfortunately, however, three parts of the system, concerned with the production, transfer, and consumption of goods, were concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them simply by examining them, while **the operations of banking and finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves did everything they could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider.** **The Relationship Between Goods and Money** **Is Clear to Bankers** **In the course of time the central fact of the developing economic system, the relationship between goods and money, became clear, at least to bankers. This relationship, the price system, depended upon five things: the supply and the demand for goods, the supply and the demand for money, and the speed of exchange between money and goods. ** An increase in three of these (demand for goods, supply of money, speed of circulation) would move the prices of goods up and the value of money down. This inflation was objectionable to bankers, although desirable to producers and merchants. On the other hand, a decrease in the same three items would be deflationary and would please bankers, worry producers and merchants, and delight consumers (who obtained more goods", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:5:6400238befa4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8769, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "money, and the speed of exchange between money and goods. ** An increase in three of these (demand for goods, supply of money, speed of circulation) would move the prices of goods up and the value of money down. This inflation was objectionable to bankers, although desirable to producers and merchants. On the other hand, a decrease in the same three items would be deflationary and would please bankers, worry producers and merchants, and delight consumers (who obtained more goods for less money). The other factors worked in the opposite direction, so that an increase in them (supply of goods, demand for money, and slowness of circulation or exchange) would be deflationary [and vice versa]. **Inflationary and Deflationary Prices Have Been a Major** **Force in History for 600 Years** Such changes of prices, either inflationary or deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Over that long period, their power to modify men's lives and human history has been increasing. This has been reflected in two ways. On the one hand, rises in prices have generally encouraged increased economic activity, especially the production of goods, while, on the other hand, price changes have served to redistribute wealth within the economic system. **Inflation, especially a slow steady rise in prices, encourages producers, because it means that they can commit themselves to costs of production on one price level and then, later, offer the finished product for sale at a somewhat higher price level. This situation encourages production because it gives confidence of an almost certain profit margin.** On the other hand, production is discouraged in a period of falling prices, unless the producer is in the very unusual situation where his costs are falling more rapidly than the prices of his product. **Bankers Obsessed With Maintaining Value of Money** **The redistribution of wealth by changing prices is equally important but attracts much less attention. Rising prices benefit debtors and injure creditors, while falling prices do the opposite.** A debtor called upon to pay a debt at a time when prices are higher than when he contracted the debt must yield up less goods and services than he obtained at the earlier date, on a lower price level when he borrowed the money. A creditor, such as a bank, which has lent money-equivalent to a certain quantity of goods and services-on one price level, gets back the same amount of money-but a smaller quantity of goods and services-when repayment comes at a higher price level, because the money repaid is then less valuable. **This is why bankers, as creditors in money terms, have been obsessed with maintaining the value of money, although the reason they have traditionally given for this obsession-that \"sound money\" maintains \"business confidence\"-has been propagandist rather than accurate.** **The Two Major Goals of Bankers** Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:6:578953787f25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8770, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "the same amount of money-but a smaller quantity of goods and services-when repayment comes at a higher price level, because the money repaid is then less valuable. **This is why bankers, as creditors in money terms, have been obsessed with maintaining the value of money, although the reason they have traditionally given for this obsession-that \"sound money\" maintains \"business confidence\"-has been propagandist rather than accurate.** **The Two Major Goals of Bankers** Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with the richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and more cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies, war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became the financiers and financial advisers of governments. **Moreover, since their relationships with governments were always in monetary terms and not real terms, and since they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges between one country's money and another, they used their power and influence to do two things: (1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of a strictly limited commodity-ultimately gold; and (2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of governments and political authority, on the ground that they would be handled better by private banking interests in terms of such a stable value as gold.** These efforts ... [were accelerated] with the shift of commercial capitalism into mercantilism and the destruction of the whole pattern of social organization based on dynastic monarchy, professional mercenary armies, and mercantilism, in the series of wars which shook Europe from the middle of the seventeenth century to 1815. Commercial capitalism passed through two periods of expansion each of which deteriorated into a later phase of war, class struggles, and retrogression. The first stage, associated with the Mediterranean Sea, was dominated by the North Italians and Catalonians but ended in a phase of crisis after 1300, which was not finally ended until 1558. The second stage of commercial capitalism, which was associated with the Atlantic Ocean, was dominated by the West Iberians, the Netherlanders, and the English. It had begun to expand by 1440, was in full swing by 1600, but by the end of the seventeenth century had become entangled in the restrictive struggles of state mercantilism and the series of wars which ravaged Europe from 1667 to 1815. **Supremacy of Charter Companies** The commercial capitalism of the 1440-1815 period was marked by the supremacy of the Chartered Companies, such as the Hudson's Bay, the Dutch and British East Indian companies, the Virginia Company, and the Association of Merchant Adventurers (Muscovy Company). England's greatest rivals in all these activities were defeated by England's greater power, and, above all, its greater security derived from its insular position. **Industrial Capitalism 1770-1850** Britain's victories over Louis XIV in the period 1667-1715", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:7:9adb23abdf56", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8771, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "1815. **Supremacy of Charter Companies** The commercial capitalism of the 1440-1815 period was marked by the supremacy of the Chartered Companies, such as the Hudson's Bay, the Dutch and British East Indian companies, the Virginia Company, and the Association of Merchant Adventurers (Muscovy Company). England's greatest rivals in all these activities were defeated by England's greater power, and, above all, its greater security derived from its insular position. **Industrial Capitalism 1770-1850** Britain's victories over Louis XIV in the period 1667-1715 and over the French Revolutionary governments and Napoleon in 1792-1815 had many causes, such as its insular position, its ability to retain control of the sea, its ability to present itself to the world as the defender of the freedoms and rights of small nations and of diverse social and religious groups. Among these numerous causes, there were a financial one and an economic one. Financially, England had discovered the secret of credit. Economically, England had embarked on the Industrial Revolution. **The Founding of the Bank of England Is One of the** **Great Dates in World History** Credit had been known to the Italians and Netherlanders long before it became one of the instruments of English world supremacy. Nevertheless, **the founding of the Bank of England by William Paterson and his friends in 1694 is one of the great dates in world history. For generations men had sought to avoid the one drawback of gold, its heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific pieces of gold.** Today we call such pieces of paper gold certificates. Such a certificate entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece of gold on demand, but in view of the convenience of paper, only a small fraction of certificate holders ever did make such demands.** It early became clear that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to cover the fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment; accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business purposes, or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates could be issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of demands against them.** Such an excess volume of paper claims against reserves we now call bank notes. **Bankers Create Money Out of Nothing** **In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the reserves available means that bankers were creating money out of nothing.** The same thing could be done in another way, not by note-issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. **Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:8:1b4ada1d1a7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8772, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "nothing.** The same thing could be done in another way, not by note-issuing banks but by deposit banks.

Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. **Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in actual money (gold, certificates, and notes) no more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon *and cashed; *the rest could be used for loans, and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. ** **Such created deposits also were a creation of money out of nothing, although bankers usually refused to express their actions, either note issuing or deposit lending, in these terms.** William Paterson, however, on obtaining the charter of the Bank of England in 1694, to use the moneys he had won in privateering, said, \"The Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.\" This was repeated by Sir Edward Holden, founder of the Midland Bank, on December 18, 1907, and is, of course, generally admitted today. **The Creation of Credit** This organizational structure for creating means of payment out of nothing, which we call credit, was not invented by England but was developed by her to become one of her chief weapons in the victory over Napoleon in 1815. The emperor, as the last great mercantilist, could not see money in any but concrete terms, and was convinced that his efforts to fight wars on the basis of \"sound money,\" by avoiding the creation of credit, would ultimately win him a victory by bankrupting England. He was wrong, although the lesson has had to be relearned by modern financiers in the twentieth century. **Britain's Victory Over Napoleon** Britain's victory over Napoleon was also helped by two economic innovations: the Agricultural Revolution, which was well established there in 1720, and the Industrial Revolution, which was equally well established there by 1776, when Watt patented his steam engine. The Industrial Revolution, like the Credit Revolution, has been much misunderstood, both at the time and since. This is unfortunate, as each of these has great significance, both to advanced and to underdeveloped countries, in the twentieth century. **The Industrial Revolution was accompanied by a number of incidental features, such as growth of cities through the factory system, the rapid growth of an unskilled labor supply (the proletariat), the reduction of labor to the status of a commodity in the competitive market, and the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:9:7e35fbb11b96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8773, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "the Credit Revolution, has been much misunderstood, both at the time and since.

None of these constituted the essential feature of industrialism, which was, in fact, the application of nonliving power to the productive process. ** This application, symbolized in the steam engine and the water wheel, in the long run served to reduce or eliminate the relative significance of unskilled labor and the use of human or animal energy in the productive process (automation) and to disperse the productive process from cities, but did so, throughout, by intensifying the vital feature of the system, the use of energy from sources other than living bodies. **The Rise of Large Industrial Enterprises in Britain** In this continuing process, Britain's early achievement of industrialism gave it such great profits that these, combined with the profits derived earlier from commercial capitalism and the simultaneous profits derived from the unearned rise in land values from new cities and mines, made its early industrial enterprises largely self-financed or at least locally financed. They were organized in proprietorships and partnerships, had contact with local deposit banks for short-term current loans, but had little to do with international bankers, investment banks, central governments, or corporative forms of business organization. This early stage of industrial capitalism, which lasted in England from about 1770 to about 1850, was shared to some extent with Belgium and even France, but took quite different forms in the United States, Germany, and Italy, and almost totally different forms in Russia or Asia. The chief reason for these differences was the need for raising funds (capital) to pay for the rearrangement of the factors of production (]and, labor, materials, skill, equipment, and so on) which industrialism required. Northwestern Europe, and above all England, had large savings for such new enterprises.

This new stage of financial capitalism, which continued to dominate England, France, and the United States as late as 1930, was made necessary by the great mobilizations of capital needed for railroad building after 1830. **The capital needed for railroads, with their enormous expenditures on track and equipment, could not be raised from single proprietorships or partnerships or locally, but, instead, required a new form of enterprise-the limited-liability stock corporation-and a new source of funds-the international investment banker** who had, until then, concentrated his attention almost entirely on international flotations of government bonds. The demands of railroads for equipment carried this same development, almost at once, into steel manufacturing and coal mining. **Financial Capitalism, 1850 - 1931** This third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to its organization and methods. **Essentially what it did was to take the old disorganized and localized methods of handling money and credit and organize them into an integrated system, on an international basis, which worked with incredible and well-oiled facility for many decades. ** The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York and Paris, and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated banking system and a heavily capitalized-if now largely obsolescent-framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel mills, coal mines, and electrical utilities. This system had its center in London for four chief reasons. First was the great volume of savings in England, resting on England's early successes in commercial and industrial capitalism. Second was England's oligarchic social structure (especially as reflected in its concentrated landownership and limited access to educational opportunities) which provided a very inequitable distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the control of a small, energetic upper class. Third was the fact that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, and thus, based on traditions rather than birth, was quite willing to recruit both money and ability from lower levels of society and even from outside the country, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks, almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able, and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen, whose disabilities from educational deprivation, provincialism, and Nonconformist (that is non-Anglican) religious background generally excluded", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:11:016ccd9d7ba4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8775, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "the fact that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, and thus, based on traditions rather than birth, was quite willing to recruit both money and ability from lower levels of society and even from outside the country, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks, almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able, and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen, whose disabilities from educational deprivation, provincialism, and Nonconformist (that is non-Anglican) religious background generally excluded them from the privileged aristocracy. **Fourth (and by no means last) in significance was the skill in financial manipulation, especially on the international scene, which the small group of merchant bankers of London had acquired in the period of commercial and industrial capitalism and which lay ready for use when the need for financial capitalist innovation became urgent.** **The Dynasties of International Bankers** The merchant bankers of London had already at hand in 1810-1850 the Stock Exchange, the Bank of England, and the London money market when the needs of advancing industrialism called all of these into the industrial world which they had hitherto ignored. **In time they brought into their financial network the provincial banking centers, organized as commercial banks and savings banks, as well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a single financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other. ** The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. **The greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) of Frankfort, whose male descendants, for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces.** Rothschild's five sons, established at branches in Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris, as well as Frankfort, cooperated together in ways which other international banking dynasties copied but rarely excelled. **The Financial Activities of International Bankers** In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic activities of international bankers, we must not totally ignore their other attributes. They were, especially in later generations, cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic.... They were usually highly civilized, cultured gentlemen, patrons of education and of the arts, so that today colleges, professorships, opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections still reflect their munificence.

They include Raring, Lazard, Erlanger, Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, the Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould, and above all Rothschild and Morgan. Even after these banking families became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of financial capitalism, they remained different from ordinary bankers in distinctive ways: (1) they were cosmopolitan and international; (2) they were close to governments and were particularly concerned with questions of government debts, including foreign government debts; (3) their interests were almost exclusively in bonds and very rarely in goods, since they admired \"liquidity\" and regarded commitments in commodities or even real estate as the first step toward bankruptcy; (4) they were, accordingly, fanatical devotees of deflation (which they called \"sound\" money from its close associations with high interest rates and a high value of money) and of the gold standard, which, in their eyes, symbolized and ensured these values; and (5) they were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in political life. **These bankers came to be called \"international bankers\" and, more particularly, were known as \"merchant bankers\" in England, \"private bankers\" in France, and \"investment bankers\" in the United States. In all countries they carried on various kinds of banking and exchange activities, but everywhere they were sharply distinguishable from other, more obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or commercial banks.** **The International Banking Fraternity Operates** **As Secretive Private Firms** **One of their less obvious characteristics was that they remained as private unincorporated firms, usually partnerships, until relatively recently, offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public. This risky status, which deprived them of limited liability, was retained, in most cases, until modern inheritance taxes made it essential to surround such family wealth with the immortality of corporate status for tax-avoidance purposes. ** **This persistence as private firms continued because it ensured the maximum of anonymity and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded public knowledge of their activities.** As a consequence, ordinary people had no way of knowing the wealth or areas of operation of such firms, and often were somewhat hazy as to their membership. Thus, people of considerable political knowledge might not associate the names Walter Burns, Clinton Dawkins, Edward Grenfell, Willard Straight, Thomas Lamont, Dwight Morrow, Nelson Perkins, Russell Leffingwell, Elihu Root, John W.

This firm, like others of the international banking fraternity, constantly operated through corporations and governments, yet remained itself an obscure private partnership until international financial capitalism was passing from its deathbed to the grave. **J. P. Morgan and Company, originally founded in London as George Peabody and Company in 1838, was not incorporated until March 21, 1940, and went out of existence as a separate entity on April 24, 1959, when it merged with its most important commercial bank subsidiary, the Guaranty Trust Company.** The London affiliate, Morgan Grenfell, was incorporated in 1934, and still exists. **International Bankers Felt Politicians Could Not Be Trusted** **With Control of the Monetary System** **The influence of financial capitalism and of the international bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on governments, but could have done neither if it had not been able to persuade both these to accept two \"axioms\" of its own ideology. ****Both of these were based on the assumption that politicians were too weak and too subject to temporary popular pressures to be trusted with control of the money system; accordingly, the sanctity of all values and the soundness of money must be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold and by allowing bankers to control the supply of money. To do this it was necessary to conceal, or even to mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation.** **The Gold Standard** For example, bankers called the process of establishing a monetary system on gold \"stabilization,\" and implied that this covered, as a single consequence, stabilization of exchanges and stabilization of prices. It really achieved only stabilization of exchanges, while its influence on prices were quite independent and incidental, and might be un-stabilizing (from its usual tendency to force prices downward by limiting the supply of money). As a consequence, many persons, including financiers and even economists, were astonished to discover, in the twentieth century, that the gold standard gave stable exchanges and unstable prices. It had, however, already contributed to a similar, but less extreme, situation in much of the nineteenth century. Exchanges were stabilized on the gold standard because by law, in various countries, the monetary unit was made equal to a fixed quantity of gold, and the two were made exchangeable at that legal ratio.

These relationships were established by the legal requirement that a person who brought gold, gold coins, or certificates to the public treasury (or other designated places) could convert any one of these into either of the others in unlimited amounts for no cost. As a result, **on a full gold standard, gold had a unique position: it was, at the same time, in the sphere of money and in the sphere of wealth. In the sphere of money, the value of all other kinds of money was expressed in terms of gold: and, in the sphere of real wealth, the values of all other kinds of goods were expressed in terms of gold as money.** If we regard the relationships between money and goods as a seesaw in which each of these was at opposite ends, so that the value of one rose just as much as the value of the other declined, then we must see gold as the fulcrum of the seesaw on which this relationship balances, but which does not itself go up or down. **It Is Impossible to Understand World History Without an** **Understanding of Money** Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the twentieth century without some understanding of the role played by money in domestic affairs and in foreign affairs, as well as the role played by bankers in economic life and in political life, we must take at least a glance at each of these four subjects. **Central Banks Were Private Institutions Owned by Shareholders** **In each country the supply of money took the form of an inverted pyramid or cone balanced on its point. In the point was a supply of gold and its equivalent certificates; on the intermediate levels was a much larger supply of notes; and at the top, with an open and expandable upper surface, was an even greater supply of deposits. Each level used the levels below it as its reserves, and, since these lower levels had smaller quantities of money, they were \"sounder.\" ** A holder of claims on the middle or upper level could increase his confidence in his claims on wealth by reducing them to a lower level, although, of course, if everyone, or any considerable number of persons, tried to do this at the same time the volume of reserves would be totally inadequate.

Notes were issued by \"banks of emission\" or \"banks of issue,\" and were secured by reserves of gold or certificates held in their own coffers or in some central reserve. The fraction of such a note issue held in reserve depended upon custom, banking regulations (including the terms of a bank's charter), or statute law. **There were formerly many banks of issue, but this function is now generally restricted to a few or even to a single \"central bank\" in each country. Such banks, even central banks, were private institutions, owned by shareholders who profited by their operations.** In the 1914-1939 period, in the United States, Federal Reserve Notes were covered by gold certificates to 40 percent of their value, but this was reduced to 25 percent in 1945. The Bank of England, by an Act of 1928, had its notes uncovered up to 250 million, and covered by gold for 100 percent value over that amount. The Bank of France, in the same year, set its note cover at 35 percent. These provisions could always be set aside or changed in an emergency, such as war. **Determining the Volume of Money in the Community** Deposits on the upper level of the pyramid were called by this name, with typical bankers' ambiguity, in spite of the fact that they consisted of two utterly different kinds of relationships: (1) \"lodged deposits,\" which were real claims left by a depositor in a bank, on which the depositor might receive interest, since such deposits were debts owed by the bank to the depositor; and (2) \"created deposits,\" which were claims created by the bank out of nothing as loans from the bank to \"depositors\" who had to pay interest on them, since these represented debt from them to the bank. In both cases, of course, checks could be drawn against such deposits to make payments to third parties, which is why both were called by the same name. Both form part of the money supply. Lodged deposits as a form of savings are deflationary, while created deposits, being an addition to the money supply, are inflationary. The volume of the latter depends on a number of factors of which the chief are the rate of interest and the demand for such credit.

These two play a very significant role in determining the volume of money in the community, since a large portion of that volume, in an advanced economic community, is made up of checks drawn against deposits. The volume of deposits banks can create, like the amount of notes they can issue, depends upon the volume of reserves available to pay whatever fraction of checks are cashed rather than deposited. **These matters may be regulated by laws, by bankers' rules, or simply by local customs. In the United States deposits were traditionally limited to ten times reserves of notes and gold. In Britain it was usually nearer twenty times such reserves. In all countries the demand for and volume of such credit was larger in time of a boom and less in time of a depression. This to a considerable extent explains the inflationary aspect of a depression, the combination helping to form the so-called \"business cycle.\"** **Central Banks Surrounded by Invisible Private** **Investment Banking Firms** In the course of the nineteenth century, with the full establishment of the gold standard and of the modern banking system, there grew up around the fluctuating inverted pyramid of the money supply a plethora of financial establishments which came to assume the configurations of a solar system; that is, of a central bank surrounded by satellite financial institutions. **In most countries the central bank was surrounded closely by the almost invisible private investment banking firms. These, like the planet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the dazzle emitted by the central bank which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a close observer could hardly fail to notice the close *private *associations between these private, international bankers and the central bank itself. ** In France, for example, in 1936 when the Bank of France was reformed, its Board of Regents (directors) was still dominated by the names of the families who had originally set it up in 1800; to these had been added a few more recent names, such as Rothschild (added in 1819); in some cases the name might not be readily recognized because it was that of a son-in-law rather than that of a son. Otherwise, in 1914, the names, frequently those of Protestants of Swiss origin (who arrived in the eighteenth century) or of Jews of German origin (who arrived in the nineteenth century), had been much the same for more than a century. **The Bank of England and Its Private Banking Firms** In England a somewhat similar situation existed, so that even in the middle of the twentieth century the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:17:40e1342efc62", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8781, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "because it was that of a son-in-law rather than that of a son.

This includes a wide variety of savings banks, insurance firms, and trust companies. Naturally, these arrangements vary greatly from place to place, especially as the division of banking functions and powers are not the same in all countries. In France and England the private bankers exercised their powers through the central bank and had much more influence on the government and on foreign policy and much less influence on industry, because in these two countries, unlike Germany, Italy, the United States, or Russia, private savings were sufficient to allow much of industry to finance itself without recourse either to bankers or government. **In the United States much industry was financed by investment bankers directly, and the power of these both on industry and on government was very great, while the central bank (the New York Federal Reserve Bank) was established late (1913) and became powerful much later** (after financial capitalism was passing from the scene). In Germany industry was financed and controlled by the discount banks, while the central bank was of little power or significance before 1914. In Russia the role of the government was dominant in much of economic life, while in Italy the situation was backward and complicated. **The Supply of Money** We have said that two of the five factors which determined the value of money (and thus the price level of goods) are the supply and the demand for money. **The supply of money in a single country was subject to no centralized, responsible control in most countries over recent centuries.

Instead, there were a variety of controls of which some could be influenced by bankers, some could be influenced by the government, and some could hardly be influenced by either.** Thus, the various parts of the pyramid of money were but loosely related to each other. Moreover, much of this looseness arose from the fact that the controls were compulsive in a deflationary direction and were only permissive in an inflationary direction. This last point can be seen in the fact that the supply of gold could be decreased but could hardly be increased. If an ounce of gold was added to the point of the pyramid in a system where law and custom allowed 10 percent reserves on each level, it *could permit *an increase of deposits equivalent to $2067 on the uppermost level. If such an ounce of gold were withdrawn from a fully expanded pyramid of money, this *would compel *a reduction of deposits by at least this amount, probably by a refusal to renew loans. ** Money Power Persuaded Governments to Establish a** **Deflationary Monetary Unit** **Throughout modern history the influence of the gold standard has been deflationary, because the natural output of gold each year, except in extraordinary times, has not kept pace with the increase in output of goods.** Only new supplies of gold, or the suspension of the gold standard in wartime, or the development of new kinds of money (like notes and checks) which economize the use of gold, have saved our civilization from steady price deflation over the last couple of centuries. **Banker Policies Lead to Inflation and Deflation** [A] paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that bankers, who loved deflation, often acted in an inflationary fashion from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they make money out of loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank credit on loan. But this is inflationary. The conflict between the deflationary ideas and inflationary practices of bankers had profound repercussions on business. The bankers made loans to business so that the volume of money increased faster than the increase in goods. The result was inflation. When this became clearly noticeable, the bankers would flee to notes or specie by curtailing credit and raising discount rates.

This was beneficial to bankers in the short run (since it allowed them to foreclose on collateral held for loans), but it could be disastrous to them in the long run (by forcing the value of the collateral below the amount of the loans it secured). But such bankers' deflation was destructive to business and industry in the short run as well as the long run. **Changing the Quality of Money** **The resulting fluctuation in the supply of money, chiefly deposits, was a prominent aspect of the \"business cycle.\" The quantity of money could be changed by changing reserve requirements or discount (interest) rates. In the United States, for example, an upper limit has been set on deposits by requiring Federal Reserve member banks to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the local Federal Reserve Bank. The percentage (usually from 7 to 26 percent) varies with the locality and the decisions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.** **Central Banks Vary Money in Circulation** **Central banks can usually vary the amount of money in circulation by \"open market operations\" or by influencing the discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a central bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market.** If it buys, it releases money into the economic system; if it sells it reduces the amount of money in the community. The change is greater than the price paid for the securities. For example, if the Federal Reserve Bank buys government securities in the open market, it pays for these by check which is soon deposited in a bank. It thus increases this bank's reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. Since banks are permitted to issue loans for several times the value of their reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank, such a transaction permits them to issue loans for a much larger sum. **Central Banks Raise and Lower Interest Rates** **Central banks can also change the quantity of money by influencing the credit policies of other banks. **This can be done by various methods, such as changing the re-discount rate or changing reserve requirements. By changing the re-discount rate we mean the interest rate which central banks charge lesser banks for loans backed by commercial paper or other security which these lesser banks have taken in return for loans.

Increasing reserve requirements curtails the ability of lesser banks to grant credit, while decreasing it expands that ability. **It is to be noted that the control of the central bank over the credit policies of local banks are permissive in one direction and compulsive in the other. They can compel these local banks to curtail credit and can only permit them to increase credit. This means that they have control powers against inflation and not deflation-a reflection of the old banking idea that inflation was bad and deflation was good.** **The Powers of Government Over Money** **The powers of governments over the quantity of money are of various kinds, and include (*a*) control over a central bank, (*b*) control over public taxation, and (*c*) control over public spending. The control of governments over central banks varies greatly from one country to another, but on the whole has been increasing. Since most central banks have been (technically) private institutions, this control is frequently based on custom rather than on law.** In any case, the control over the supply of money which governments have through centra! banks is exercised by the regular banking procedures we have discussed. The powers of the government over the quantity of money in the community exercised through taxation and public spending are largely independent of banking control. Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community and is usually a deflationary force; government spending tends to increase the amount of money in a community and is usually an inflationary force. The total effects of a government's policy will depend on which item is greater. An unbalanced budget will be inflationary; a budget with a surplus will be deflationary. A government can also change the amount of money in a community by other, more drastic, methods. By changing the gold content of the monetary unit they can change the amount of money in the community by a much greater amount. If, for example, the gold content of the dollar is cut in half,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:21:066219c1c6d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8785, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "effects of a government's policy will depend on which item is greater.

By changing the gold content of the monetary unit they can change the amount of money in the community by a much greater amount. If, for example, the gold content of the dollar is cut in half, the amount of gold certificates will be able to be doubled, and the amount of notes and deposits reared on this basis will be increased many fold, depending on the customs of the community in respect to reserve requirements. Moreover, if a government goes off the gold standard completely-that is, refuses to exchange certificates and notes for specie-the amount of notes and deposits can be increased indefinitely because these are no longer limited by limited amounts of gold reserves. **Money Power - Controlled by International Investment Bankers - Dominates Business and Government** In the various actions which increase or decrease the supply of money, governments, bankers, and industrialists have not always seen eye to eye. **On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially the Money Power controlled by the international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate business, especially in activities and in areas where industry could not finance its own needs for capital, because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse to supply such capital. Thus, Rothschild interests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at least 26,000 miles of American railroads. ** **Such bankers went further than this. In return for flotations of securities of industry, they took seats on the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and finance companies. From these lesser institutions they funneled capital to enterprises which yielded control and away from those who resisted. These firms were controlled through interlocking directorships, holding companies, and lesser banks. They engineered amalgamations and generally reduced competition, until by the early twentieth century many activities were so monopolized that they could raise their noncompetitive prices above costs to obtain sufficient profits to become self-financing. ** **But before that stage was reached a relatively small number of bankers were in positions of immense influence in European and American economic life. As early as 1909, Walter Rathenau, who was in a position to know (since he had inherited from his father control of the German General Electric Company and held scores of directorships himself), said, \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.\"** **The Power of Investment Bankers Over Governments** The power of investment bankers over governments rests", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:22:fde75a13910b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8786, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "of immense influence in European and American economic life.

Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances to smooth over the discrepancies between their irregular and intermittent incomes and their periodic and persistent outgoes (such as monthly rents, annual mortgage payments, and weekly wages), so a government has to go to merchant bankers (or institutions controlled by them) to tide over the shallow places caused by irregular tax receipts. **As experts in government bonds, the international bankers not only handled the necessary advances but provided advice to government officials and, on many occasions, placed their own members in official posts for varied periods to deal with special problems. This is so widely accepted even today that in 1961 a Republican investment banker became Secretary of the Treasury in a Democratic Administration in Washington without significant comment from any direction.** **The Money Power Reigns Supreme and Unquestioned** **Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during the age of financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not something about which anyone talked freely, but it has been admitted frequently enough by those on the inside**, especially in England. In 1852 Gladstone, chancellor of the Exchequer, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" On September 26, 1921, *The Financial Times *wrote, \"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" In 1924 Sir Drummond Fraser, vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, stated, \"The Governor of the Bank of England must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money.\" **Montagu Norman and J. P. Morgan Dominate the Financial World** In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other pressures. **Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from bankers whom they considered to be experts in the field.

The history of the last century shows, as we shall see later, that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave to industrialists, was consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen, and the people generally. ** **Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even levels of business activity.** Thus Morgan dominated Cleveland's second administration by gold withdrawals, and in 1936-1938 French foreign exchange manipulators paralyzed the Popular Front governments. As we shall see, the powers of these international bankers reached their peak in the last decade of their supremacy, 1919-1931, when Montagu Norman and J. P. Morgan dominated not only the financial world but international relations and other matters as well. On November I l, 1927, the *Wall Street Journal *called Mr. Norman \"the currency dictator of Europe.\" This was admitted by Mr. Norman himself before the Court of the Bank on March 21, 1930, and before the Macmillan Committee of the House of Commons five days later. On one occasion, just before international financial capitalism ran, at full speed, on the rocks which sank it, Mr. Norman is reported to have said, \"I hold the hegemony of the world.\" At the time, some Englishmen spoke of \"the second Norman Conquest of England\" in reference to the fact that Norman's brother was head of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It might be added that Governor Norman rarely acted in major world problems without consulting with J. P. Morgan's representatives, and as a consequence he was one of the most widely traveled men of his day. **The Development of Monopoly Capitalism** This conflict of interests between bankers and industrialists has resulted in most European countries in the subordination of the former either to the latter or to the government (after 1931). This subordination was accomplished by the adoption of \"unorthodox financial policies\"-that is, financial policies not in accordance with the short-run interests of bankers. This shift by which bankers were made subordinate reflected a fundamental development in modern economic history-a development which can be described as the growth from financial capitalism to monopoly capitalism. This took place in Germany earlier than in any other country and was well under way by 1926. It came in Britain only after 1931 and in Italy only in 1934. It did not occur in France to a comparable extent at all, and this explains the economic weakness of France in 1938-1940 to a considerable degree. **Elimination of the Gold Standard** The flow of gold", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:24:1dc42a047336", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8788, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "development which can be described as the growth from financial capitalism to monopoly capitalism.

It did not occur in France to a comparable extent at all, and this explains the economic weakness of France in 1938-1940 to a considerable degree. **Elimination of the Gold Standard** The flow of gold from country to country resulting from unbalanced trade tends to create a situation which counteracts the flow. If a country exports more than it imports so that gold flows in to cover the difference, this gold will become the basis for an increased quantity of money, and this will cause a rise of prices within the country sufficient to reduce exports and increase imports. At the same time, the gold by flowing out of some other country will reduce the quantity of money there and will cause a fall in prices within that country. These shifts in prices will cause shifts in the flow of goods because of the obvious fact that goods tend to flow to higher-priced areas and cease to flow to lower-priced areas. These shifts in the flow of goods will counteract the original unbalance in trade which caused the flow of gold. As a result, the flow of gold will cease, and a balanced international trade at slightly different price levels will result. The whole process illustrates the subordination of internal price stability to stability of exchanges. It was this subordination which was rejected by most countries after 1931. This rejection was signified by (*a*) abandonment of the gold standard at least in part, (*b*) efforts at control of domestic prices, and (*c*) efforts at exchange control. All these were done because of a desire to free the economic system from the restricting influence of a gold-dominated financial system. **Major Countries Forced to Abandon Gold Standard** This wonderful, automatic mechanism of international payments represents one of the greatest social instruments ever devised by man. It requires, however, a very special group of conditions for its effective functioning and, as we shall show, these conditions were disappearing by 1900 and were largely wiped away as a result of the economic changes brought about by the First World War. Because of these changes it became impossible to restore the financial system which had existed before 1914. Efforts to restore it were made with great determination, but by 1933 they had obviously failed, and all major countries had been forced to abandon the gold standard and automatic exchanges. **When the gold standard is abandoned, gold flows between countries like any other commodity, and the value of foreign exchanges (no longer tied to gold) can fluctuate much more widely.** In theory an unbalance of international payments can be rectified either", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:25:4056a214297c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8789, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "the financial system which had existed before 1914.

On the gold standard this rectification is made by shifts in exchange rates only between the gold points. When the unbalance is so great that exchanges would be forced beyond the gold points, the rectification is made by means of changing internal prices caused by the fact that gold flows at the gold points, instead of the exchanges passing beyond the gold points. On the other hand, when a currency is off the gold standard, fluctuation of exchanges is not confined between any two points but can go indefinitely in either direction. In such a case, the unbalance of international payments is worked out largely by a shift in exchange rates and only remotely by shifts in internal prices. In the period of 1929-1936, the countries of the world went off gold because they preferred to bring their international balances toward equilibrium by means of fluctuating exchanges rather than by means of fluctuating price levels. They feared these last because changing (especially falling) prices led to declines in business activity and shifts in the utilization of economic resources (such as labor, land, and capital) from one activity to another. **Reestablishing the Balance of International Payments** The reestablishment of the balance of international payments when a currency is off gold can be seen from an example. If the value of the pound sterling falls to $4.00 or $3.00, Americans will buy in England increasingly because English prices are cheap for them, but Englishmen will buy in America only with reluctance because they have to pay so much for American money. This will serve to rectify the original excess of exports to England which gave the great supply of pound sterling necessary to drive its value down to $3.00. Such a depreciation in the exchange value of a currency will cause a rise in prices within the country as a result of the increase in demand for the goods of that country. **The Situation before 1914** **The key to the world situation in the period before 1914 is to be found in the dominant position of Great Britain.

This position was more real than apparent. In many fields (such as naval or financial) the supremacy of Britain was so complete that it almost never had to be declared by her or admitted by others. It was tacitly assumed by both. As an unchallenged ruler in these fields, Britain could afford to be a benevolent ruler. Sure of herself and of her position, she could be satisfied with substance rather than forms. If others accepted her dominance in fact, she was quite willing to leave to them independence and autonomy in law.** **The Supremacy of Britain** This supremacy of Britain was not an achievement of the nineteenth century alone. Its origins go back to the sixteenth century-to the period in which the discovery of America made the Atlantic more important than the Mediterranean as a route of commerce and a road to wealth. In the Atlantic, Britain's position was unique, not merely because of her westernmost position, but much more because she was an island. This last fact made it possible for her to watch Europe embroil itself in internal squabbles while she retained freedom to exploit the new worlds across the seas. On this basis, Britain had built up a naval supremacy which made her ruler of the seas by 1900. Along with this was her preeminence in merchant shipping which gave her control of the avenues of world transportation and ownership of 39 percent of the world's oceangoing vessels (three times the number of her nearest rival). To her supremacy in these spheres, won in the period before 1815, Britain added new spheres of dominance in the period after 1815. These arose from her early achievement of the Industrial Revolution. This was applied to transportation and communications as well as to industrial production. In the first it gave the world the railroad and the steamboat; in the second it gave the telegraph, the cable, and the telephone; in the third it gave the factory system. **The Industrial Revolution** The Industrial Revolution existed in Britain for almost two generations before it spread elsewhere. It gave a great increase in output of manufactured goods and a great demand for raw materials and food; it also gave a great increase in wealth and savings. As a result of the first two and the improved methods of transportation, Britain developed a world trade of which it was the center and which consisted chiefly of the export of manufactured goods and the import of raw materials and food. At the same time, the savings of Britain tended to flow out to North America, South America, and Asia, seeking to increase the output", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:27:66c372c5c193", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8791, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "raw materials and food; it also gave a great increase in wealth and savings.

At the same time, the savings of Britain tended to flow out to North America, South America, and Asia, seeking to increase the output of raw materials and food in these areas. By 1914 these exports of capital had reached such an amount that they were greater than the foreign investments of all other countries put together. In 1914 British overseas investment was about $20 billion (or about one-quarter of Britain's national wealth, yielding about a tenth of the total national income). The French overseas investment at the same time was about $9 billion (or one-sixth the French national wealth, yielding 6 percent of the national income), while Germany had about $5 billion invested overseas (one-fifteenth the national wealth, yielding 3 percent of the national income). The United States at that time was a large-scale debtor. **The World's Great Commercial Markets Were in Britain** The dominant position of Britain in the world of 1913 was, as I have said, more real than apparent. In all parts of the world people slept more securely' worked more productively, and lived more fully because Britain existed. British naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Far East suppressed slave raiders, pirates, and headhunters. Small nations like Portugal, the Netherlands, or Belgium retained their overseas possessions under the protection of the British fleet. Even the United States, without realizing it, remained secure and upheld the Monroe Doctrine behind the shield of the British Navy. Small nations were able to preserve their independence in the gaps between the Great Powers, kept in precarious balance by the Foreign Office's rather diffident balance-of-power tactics. Most of the world's great commercial markets, even in commodities like cotton, rubber, and tin, which she did not produce in quantities herself, were in England, the world price being set from the auction bidding of skilled specialist traders there. If a man in Peru wished to send money to a man in Afghanistan, the final payment, as like as not, would be made by a bookkeeping transaction in London. The English parliamentary system and some aspects of the English judicial system, such as the rule of law, were being copied, as best as could be, in all parts of the world. **Britain Was the Center of World Finance and World Trade** **The profitability of capital outside Britain-a fact which caused the great export of capital-was matched by a profitability of labor.

As a result, the flow of capital from Britain and Europe was matched by a flow of persons. Both of these served to build up non-European areas on a modified European pattern. In export of men, as in export of capital, Britain was easily first (over 20 million persons emigrating from the United Kingdom in the period 1815-1938). As a result of both, Britain became the center of world finance as well as the center of world commerce. ** The system of international financial relations, which we described earlier, was based on the system of industrial, commercial, and credit relationships which we have just described. The former thus required for its existence a very special group of circumstances-a group which could not be expected to continue forever. In addition, it required a group of secondary characteristics which were also far from permanent. Among these were the following: (1) all the countries concerned must be on the full gold standard; (2) there must be freedom from public or private interference with the domestic economy of any country; that is, prices must be free to rise and fall in accordance with the supply and demand for both goods and money; (3) there must also be free flow of international trade so that both goods and money can go without hindrance to those areas where each is most valuable; (4) the international financial economy must be organized about one center with numerous subordinate centers, so that it would be possible to cancel out international claims against one another in some clearinghouse and thus reduce the flow of gold to a minimum; (5) the flow of goods and funds in international matters should be controlled by economic factors and not be subject to political, psychological, or ideological influences. These conditions, which made the international financial and commercial system function so beautifully before 1914, had begun to change by 1890. The fundamental economic and commercial conditions changed first, and were noticeably modified by 1910; the group of secondary characteristics of the system were changed by the events of the First World War.

It does, however, contain an element of truth: much of the empire was acquired by private individuals and commercial firms, and was taken over by the British government much later. The motives which impelled the government to annex areas which its citizens had been exploiting were varied, both in time and in place, and were frequently much different from what an outsider might believe. **Britain acquired the world's greatest empire because it possessed certain advantages which other countries lacked. We mention three of these advantages: (1) that it was an island, (2) that it was in the Atlantic, and (3) that its social traditions at home produced the will and the talents for imperial acquisition.** **England Developed an Aristocracy** While the landed upper class of England was unable to become a nobility (that is, a caste based on exalted birth), it was able to become an aristocracy (that is, an upper class distinguished by traditions and behavior). **The chief attributes of this aristocratic upper class in England were (1) that it should be trained in an expensive, exclusive, masculine, and relatively Spartan educational system centering about the great boys' schools like Eton, Harrow, or Winchester;** (2) that it should imbibe from this educational system certain distinctive attitudes of leadership, courage, sportsmanship, team play, self-sacrifice, disdain for physical comforts, and devotion to duty; (3) that it should be prepared in later life to devote a great deal of time and energy to unpaid tasks of public significance, as justices of the peace, on county councils, in the county militia, or in other services. Since all the sons of the upper classes received the same training, while only the oldest, by primogeniture, was entitled to take over the income-yielding property of the family, all the younger sons had to go out into the world to seek their fortunes, and, as likely as not, would do their seeking overseas. At the same time, the uneventful life of the typical English village or county, completely controlled by the upperclass oligarchy, made it necessary for the more ambitious members of the lower classes to seek advancement outside the county and even outside England. From these two sources were recruited the men who acquired Britain's empire and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:30:026979db7dce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8794, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "all the younger sons had to go out into the world to seek their fortunes, and, as likely as not, would do their seeking overseas.

From these two sources were recruited the men who acquired Britain's empire and the men who colonized it. **The British Empire** **The English have not always been unanimous in regarding the empire as a source of pride and benefit. In fact, the middle generation of the nineteenth century was filled with persons, such as Gladstone, who regarded the empire with profound suspicion.** They felt that it was a source of great expense; they were convinced that it involved England in remote strategic problems which could easily lead to wars England had no need to fight; they could see no economic advantage in having an empire, since the existence of free trade (which this generation accepted) would allow commerce to flow no matter who held colonial areas. They were convinced that any colonial areas, no matter at what cost they might be acquired, would eventually separate from the mother country, voluntarily if they were given the rights of Englishmen, or by rebellion, as the American colonies had done, if they were deprived of such rights. In general, the \"Little Englanders,\" as they were called, were averse to colonial expansion on the grounds of cost. **Colonies Could Be a Source of Riches** Although upholders of the \"Little England\" point of view, men like Gladstone or Sir William Harcourt, continued in political prominence until 1895, this point of view was in steady retreat after 1870. There were many factors which led to the growth of imperialism after 1870, and many obvious manifestations of that growth. The Royal Colonial Institute was founded in 1868 to fight the \"Little England\" idea; Disraeli as prime minister (1874-1880) dramatized the profit and glamour of empire by such acts as the purchase of control of the Suez Canal and by granting Queen Victoria the title of Empress of India. **After 1870 it became increasingly evident that, however expensive colonies might be to a government, they could be fantastically profitable to individuals and companies supported by such governments; moreover, with the spread of democracy and the growing influence of the press and the expanding need for campaign contributions, individuals who made fantastic profits in overseas adventures could obtain favorable support from their governments by contributing some part of their profits to politicians' expenses.** The efforts of King Leopold II of Belgium, using Henry Stanley, to obtain the Congo area as his own preserve in 1876-1880, started a contagious fever of colony-grabbing in Africa which lasted for more than thirty years; the discovery", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:31:4e9a96ba1019", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8795, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "of democracy and the growing influence of the press and the expanding need for campaign contributions, individuals who made fantastic profits in overseas adventures could obtain favorable support from their governments by contributing some part of their profits to politicians' expenses.** The efforts of King Leopold II of Belgium, using Henry Stanley, to obtain the Congo area as his own preserve in 1876-1880, started a contagious fever of colony-grabbing in Africa which lasted for more than thirty years; the discovery of diamonds (in 1869) and of gold (in 1886) in South Africa, especially in the Boer Transvaal Republic, intensified this fever. **John Ruskin** The new imperialism after 1870 was quite different in tone from that which the Little Englanders had opposed earlier. The chief changes were that it was justified on grounds of moral duty and of social reform and not, as earlier, on grounds of missionary activity and material advantage. The man most responsible for this change was John Ruskin. Until 1870 there was no professorship of fine arts at Oxford, but in that year ... John Ruskin was named to such a chair. He hit Oxford like an earthquake, not so much because he talked about fine arts, but because he talked also about the empire and England's downtrodden masses, and above all because he talked about all three of these things as moral issues. **Until the end of the nineteenth century the poverty-stricken masses in the cities of England lived in want, ignorance, and crime very much as they have been described by Charles Dickens. Ruskin spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged, ruling class. He told them that they were the possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law, freedom, decency, and self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved, and did not deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower classes in England itself and to the non-English masses throughout the world.** If this precious tradition were not extended to these two great majorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen would ultimately be submerged by these majorities and the tradition lost. To prevent this, the tradition must be extended to the masses and to the empire. **Cecil Rhodes Sets Up a Monopoly Over the Gold and ****Diamond Mines in South Africa** **Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural lecture was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes, who kept it with him for thirty years. Rhodes (1853-1902) feverishly exploited the diamond and goldfields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister of the Cape Colony (1890-1896), contributed money to political parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and in South Africa, and sought to win a strip of British territory across Africa from the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt and to join these two extremes together with a telegraph line and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:32:b6de73d2184f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8796, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes, who kept it with him for thirty years.

With financial support from Lord Rothschild and Alfred Beit, he was able to monopolize the diamond mines of South Africa as De Beers Consolidated Mines and to build up a great gold mining enterprise as Consolidated Gold Fields.** In the middle 1890's Rhodes had a personal income of at least a million pounds sterling a year [equivalent to about $100 million a year in current U.S. dollars] which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his account. These purposes centered on his desire to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all the habitable portions of the world under their control. For this purpose Rhodes left part of his great fortune to found the Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford in order to spread the English ruling class tradition throughout the English-speaking world. **Cecil Rhodes Organized a Secret Society in 1891** Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group of intimate friends including Arnold Toynbee, Alfred (later Lord) Milner, Arthur Glazebrook, George (later Sir George) Parkin, Philip Lyttelton Gell, and Henry (later Sir Henry) Birchenough. These were so moved by Ruskin that they devoted the rest of their lives to carrying out his ideas. A similar group of Cambridge men ... were also aroused by Ruskin's message and devoted their lives to extension of the British Empire and uplift of England's urban masses as two parts of one project which they called \"extension of the English-speaking idea.\" They were remarkably successful in these aims because England's most sensational journalist William T. Stead (1849-1912), an ardent social reformer and imperialist, brought them into association with Rhodes. **This association was formally established on February 5, 1891, when Rhodes and Stead organized a secret society of which Rhodes had been dreaming for sixteen years. In this secret society Rhodes was to be leader; Stead, Brett (Lord Esher), and Milner were to form an executive committee; Arthur (Lord) Balfour, (Sir) Harry Johnston, Lord Rothschild, Albert (Lord) Grey, and others were listed as potential members of a \"Circle of Initiates\"; while there was to be an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" (later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization). ** **Financial Backing of the Secret Society** This group was able to get access", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:33:4a84cfbbd331", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8797, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "this secret society Rhodes was to be leader; Stead, Brett (Lord Esher), and Milner were to form an executive committee; Arthur (Lord) Balfour, (Sir) Harry Johnston, Lord Rothschild, Albert (Lord) Grey, and others were listed as potential members of a \"Circle of Initiates\"; while there was to be an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" (later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization). ** **Financial Backing of the Secret Society** This group was able to get access to Rhodes's money after his death in 1902 and also to the funds of loyal Rhodes supporters. With this backing they sought to extend and execute the ideals that Rhodes had obtained from Ruskin and Stead. Milner was the chief Rhodes Trustee and Parkin was Organizing Secretary of the Rhodes Trust after 1902. They were joined in their efforts by other Ruskinite friends of Stead's like Lord Grey, Lord Esher, and Flora Shaw (later Lady Lugard). In 1890, by a stratagem too elaborate to describe here, Miss Shaw became Head of the Colonial Department of *The Times *while still remaining on the payroll of Stead's *Pall Mall Gazette. *In this post she played a major role in the next ten years in carrying into execution the imperial schemes of Cecil Rhodes, to whom Stead had introduced her in 1889. **The Toynbee Hall Is Set Up** In the meantime, in 1884, acting under Ruskin's inspiration, a group which included Arnold Toynbee, Milner, Gell, Grey, Seeley, and Michael Glazebrook founded the first \"settlement house,\" an organization by which educated, upper-class people could live in the slums in order to assist, instruct, and guide the poor, with particular emphasis on social welfare and adult education. The new enterprise, set up in East London with P. L. Gell as chairman, was named Toynbee Hall after Arnold Toynbee who died, aged 31, in 1883. This was the original model for the thousands of settlement houses, such as Hull House in Chicago, now found throughout the world, and was one of the seeds from which the modern movement for adult education and university extension grew. **Roundtable Group Established** As governor-general and high commissioner of South Africa in the period 1897-1905, Milner recruited a group of young men, chiefly from Oxford and from Toynbee Hall, to assist him in organizing his administration. Through his influence** these men were able to win influential posts in government and international finance and became the dominant influence in British imperial and foreign affairs up to 1939.** ** In 1909-1913 they organized semi-secret groups, known as Round Table Groups, in the chief British dependencies and the United States.

We might mention as an example that this group dominated *The Times *from 1890 to 1912, and has controlled it completely since 1912 (except for the years 1919-1922).** Because *The Times *has been owned by the Astor family since 1922, this Rhodes-Milner group was sometimes spoken of as the \"Cliveden Set,\" named after the Astor country house where they sometimes assembled. Numerous other papers and journals have been under the control or influence of this group since 1889. They have also established and influenced numerous university and other chairs of imperial affairs and international relations. Some of these are the Beit chairs at Oxford, the Montague Burton chair at Oxford, the Rhodes chair at London, the Stevenson chair at Chatham House, the Wilson chair at Aberystwyth, and others, as well as such important sources of influence as Rhodes House at Oxford. **Roundtable Groups Seek to Extend the British Empire** **From 1884 to about 1915 the members of this group worked valiantly to extend the British Empire and to organize it in a federal system. They were constantly harping on the lessons to be learned from the failure of the American Revolution and the success of the Canadian federation of 1867, and hoped to federate the various parts of the empire as seemed feasible, then confederate the whole of it, with the United Kingdom, into a single organization.

They also hoped to bring the United States into this organization to whatever degree was possible. ** Stead was able to get Rhodes to accept, in principle, a solution which might have made Washington the capital of the whole organization or allow parts of the empire to become states of the American Union. The varied character of the British imperial possessions, the backwardness of many of the native peoples involved, the independence of many of the white colonists overseas, and the growing international tension which culminated in the First World War made it impossible to carry out the plan for Imperial Federation, although the five colonies in Australia were joined into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 and the four colonies in South Africa were joined into the Union of South Africa in 1910. **In spite of the terms of the Rhodes wills, Rhodes himself was not a racist. Nor was he a political democrat. He worked as easily and as closely with Jews, black natives, or Boers as he did with English. But he had a passionate belief in the value of a liberal education, and was attached to a restricted suffrage and even to a non-secret ballot.** In South Africa he was a staunch friend of the Dutch and of the blacks, found his chief political support among the Boers, until at least 1895, and wanted restrictions on natives put on an educational rather than on a color basis. These ideas have generally been held by his group since and have played an important role in British imperial history. **His greatest weakness rested on the fact that his passionate attachment to his goals made him overly tolerant in regard to methods. He did not hesitate to use either bribery or force to attain his ends if he judged they would be effective. **This weakness led to his greatest errors, the Jameson Raid of 1895 and the Boer War of 1899-1902, errors which were disastrous for the future of the empire he loved. The British tradition of fair conduct toward natives and nonwhites generally was found most frequently among the best educated of the English upper class and among those lower-class groups, such as missionaries, where religious influences were strongest. This tradition was greatly strengthened by the actions of the Rhodes-Milner group, especially after 1920. Rhodes aroused considerable ill-feeling among the whites of South Africa when he announced that his program included \"equal rights for all civilized men south of the Zambezi,\" and went on to indicate that \"civilized men\" included ambitious, literate Negroes. **Making", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:36:8ff20c61737a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8800, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "found most frequently among the best educated of the English upper class and among those lower-class groups, such as missionaries, where religious influences were strongest.

They were in a hurry to achieve this before the war with Germany which they believed to be approaching. With Abe Bailey money they founded *The* *Round Table* under Kerr's (Lothian's) editorship, met in formal conclaves presided over by Milner to decide the fate of the empire, and recruited new members to their group, chiefly from New College, of which Milner was a fellow. For several years (1910 to 1916) the Round Table groups worked desperately trying to find an acceptable formula for federating the empire. Three books and many articles emerged from these discussions, but gradually it became clear that federation was not acceptable to the English-speaking dependencies. Gradually, it was decided to dissolve all formal bonds between these dependencies, except, perhaps, allegiance to the Crown, and depend on the common outlook of Englishmen to keep the empire together. This involved changing the name \"British Empire\" to \"Commonwealth of Nations,\" as in the title of Curtis's book of 1916, giving the chief dependencies, including India and Ireland, their complete independence (but gradually - and by free gift rather than under duress), working to bring the United States more closely into this same orientation, and seeking to solidify the intangible links of sentiment by propaganda among financial, educational, and political leaders in each country. As soon as Milner became one of the four members of the War Cabinet in 1915 his influence began to be felt everywhere. He established a Cabinet secretariat in 1916-1917. At the same time he gave the Prime Minister, Lloyd George, a secretariat from the Round Table, consisting of Kerr (Lothian), Grigg (Lord Altrincham), W. G. S. Adams (Fellow of All Souls College), and Astor. He created an Imperial War Cabinet by adding Dominion Prime Ministers (particularly Smuts) to the United Kingdom War Cabinet. As the war drew to a close in 1918, Milner took the office of Colonial Secretary, with Amery as his assistant, negotiated an agreement providing independence for Egypt, set up a new self-government constitution in Malta, sent Curtis to India (where he drew up the chief provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919), appointed Curtis to the post of Adviser on Irish Affairs (where he played an important role in granting", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:37:6884da4921cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8801, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "Smuts) to the United Kingdom War Cabinet.

During this decade 1919-1929 the Rhodes-Milner group gave the chief impetus toward transforming the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations and launching India on the road to responsible self-government. The creation of the Round Table groups ... in 1909-1913 opened a new day in both these fields, although the whole group was so secretive that, even today, many close students of the subject are not aware of its significance. **Chapter 20 - The Period of Stabilization, 1922-1930** As soon as the [the first world] war was finished, governments began to turn their attention to the problem of restoring the prewar financial system. Since the essential element in that system was believed to be the gold standard with its stable exchanges, this movement was called \"stabilization.\" Because of their eagerness to restore the prewar financial situation, the \"experts\" closed their eyes to the tremendous changes which had resulted from the war. These changes were so great in production, in commerce, and in financial habits that any effort to restore the prewar conditions or even stabilize on the gold standard was impossible and inadvisable. Instead of seeking a financial system adapted to the new economic and commercial world which had emerged from the war, the experts tried to ignore this world, and established a financial system which looked, superficially, as much like the prewar system as possible. This system, however, was not the prewar system. Neither was it adapted to the new economic conditions. When the experts began to have vague glimmerings of this last fact, they did not begin to modify their goals, but insisted on the same goals, and voiced incantations and exhortations against the existing conditions which made the attainment of their goals impossible. These changed economic conditions could not be controlled or exorcised by incantations. They were basically not results of the war at all, but normal outcomes of the economic development of the world in the nineteenth century. All that the war had done was to speed up the rate of this development. The economic changes which in 1925 made it so difficult to restore the financial system of 1914 were already discernible in 1890 and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:38:c7c2ba4f464e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8802, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "the attainment of their goals impossible.

All that the war had done was to speed up the rate of this development. The economic changes which in 1925 made it so difficult to restore the financial system of 1914 were already discernible in 1890 and clearly evident by 1910. **Britain's Supremacy as the Financial Center of the** **World Is Threatened** **The chief item in these changes was the decline of Britain. What had happened was that the Industrial Revolution was spreading beyond Britain to Europe and the United States and by 1910 to South America and Asia. As a result, these areas became less dependent on Britain for manufactured goods, less eager to sell their raw materials and food products to her, and became her competitors both in selling to and in buying from those colonial areas to which industrialism had not yet spread. By 1914 Britain's supremacy as financial center, as commercial market, as creditor, and as merchant shipper was being threatened. ** A less obvious threat arose from long-run shifts in demand-shifts from the products of heavy industry to the products of more highly specialized branches of production (like chemicals), from cereals to fruits and dairy products, from cotton and wool to silk and rayon, from leather to rubber, and so on. These changes presented Britain with a fundamental choice-either to yield her supremacy in the world or reform her industrial and commercial system to cope with the new conditions. The latter was difficult because Britain had allowed her industrial system to become lopsided under the influence of free trade and international division of labor. Over half the employed persons in Britain were engaged in the manufacture of textiles and ferrous metals. Textiles accounted for over one-third of her exports, and textiles, along with iron and steel, for over one-half. At the same time, newer industrial nations (Germany, the United States, and Japan) were growing rapidly with industrial systems better adapted to the trend of the times; and these were also cutting deeply into Britain's supremacy in merchant shipping. **America Becomes the World's Greatest Creditor** At this critical stage in Britain's development, the World War occurred. This had a double result as far as this subject is concerned. It forced Britain to postpone indefinitely any reform of her industrial system to adjust it to more modern trends; and it speeded up the development of these trends so that what might have occurred in twenty years was done instead in five. In the period 1910-1920, Britain's merchant fleet fell by 6 percent in number of vessels, while that of the United States went up 57 percent, that of Japan up 130 percent, and that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:39:4495fa150097", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8803, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "as this subject is concerned.

Her position as the world's greatest creditor was lost to the United States, and a large quantity of good foreign credits was replaced by a smaller amount of poorer risks. In addition, she became a debtor to the United States to the amount of over $4 billion. **The change in the positions of the two countries can be summarized briefly. The war changed the position of the United States in respect to the rest of the world from that of a debtor owing about $3 billion to that of a creditor owed $4 billion. This does not include intergovernmental debts of about $10 billion owed to the United States as a result of the war. **At the same time, Britain's position changed from a creditor owed about $18 billion to a creditor owed about $13.5 billion. In addition, Britain was owed about $8 billion in war debts from her Allies and an unknown sum in reparations from Germany, and owed to the United States war debts of well over 54 billion. Most of these war debts and reparations were sharply reduced after 1920, but the net result for Britain was a drastic change in her position in respect to the United States. **Modification of the Basic Economic Organization of the World** The basic economic organization of the world was modified in other ways. As a result of the war, the old organization of relatively free commerce among countries specializing in different types of production was replaced by a situation in which a larger number of countries sought economic self-sufficiency by placing restrictions on commerce. In addition, productive capacity in both agriculture and industry had been increased by the artificial demand of the war period to a degree far beyond the ability of normal domestic demand to buy the products of that capacity. And, finally, the more backward areas of Europe and the world had been industrialized to a great degree and were unwilling to fall back to a position in which they would obtain industrial products from Britain, Germany, or the United States in return for their raw materials and food. This refusal was made more painful for both sides by the fact that these backward areas had increased their outputs of raw materials and food so greatly that the total could hardly have been sold even if they had been willing to buy", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:40:95c42d3e9701", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8804, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "been industrialized to a great degree and were unwilling to fall back to a position in which they would obtain industrial products from Britain, Germany, or the United States in return for their raw materials and food.

These prewar sources in turn had increased their industrial capacity so greatly that the product could hardly have been sold if they had been able to recapture entirely all their prewar markets. The result was a situation where all countries were eager to sell and reluctant to buy, and sought to achieve these mutually irreconcilable ends by setting up subsidies and bounties on exports, tariffs, and restrictions on imports, with disastrous results on world trade. **The only sensible solution to this problem of excessive productive capacity would have been a substantial rise in domestic standards of living, but this would have required a fundamental reapportionment of the national income so that claims to the product of the excess capacity would go to those masses eager to consume, rather than continue to go to the minority desiring to save. Such a reform was rejected by the ruling groups in both \"advanced\" and \"backward\" countries, so that this solution was reached only to a relatively small degree in a relatively few countries.** **International Bankers Began to Set Gold Aside** Changes in the basic productive and commercial organization of the world in the period 1914-1919 were made more difficult to adjust by other less tangible changes in financial practices and business psychology. The spectacular postwar inflations in eastern Europe had intensified the traditional fear of inflation among bankers. In an effort to stop rises in prices which might become inflationary, bankers after 1919 increasingly sought to \"sterilize\" gold when it flowed into their country. That is, they sought to set it aside so that it did not become part of the monetary system. As a result, the unbalance of trade which had initiated the flow of gold was not counteracted by price changes. Trade and prices remained unbalanced, and gold continued to flow. Somewhat similar was a spreading fear of decreasing gold reserves, so that when gold began to flow out of a country as a result of an unfavorable balance of international payments, bankers increasingly sought to hinder the flow by restrictions on gold exports. With such actions the unfavorable balance of trade continued, and other countries were inspired to take retaliatory actions.

The situation was also disturbed by political fears and by the military ambitions of certain countries, since these frequently resulted in a desire for self-sufficiency (autarchy) such as could be obtained only by use of tariffs, subsidies, quotas, and trade controls. Somewhat related to this was the widespread increase in feelings of economic, political, and social insecurity. This gave rise to \"flights of capital\"-that is, to panic transfers of holdings seeking a secure spot regardless of economic return. Moreover, the situation was disturbed by the arrival in the foreign-exchange market of a very large number of relatively ignorant speculators. In the period before 1914 speculators in foreign exchange had been a small group of men whose activities were based on long experience with the market and had a stabilizing effect on it. **After 1919 large numbers of persons with neither knowledge nor experience began to speculate in foreign exchange. Subject to the influence of rumors, hearsay, and mob panic, their activities had a very disturbing effect on the markets.** ** Finally, within each country, the decline in competition arising from the growth of labor unions, cartels, monopolies, and so on, made prices less responsive to flows of gold or exchange in the international markets, and, as a result, such flows did not set into motion those forces which would equalize prices between countries, curtail flows of gold, and balance flows of goods.** **Most Countries Leave the Gold Standard** As a result of all these factors, the system of international payments which had worked ... before 1914 worked only haltingly after that date, and practically ceased to work at all after 1930. The chief cause of these factors was that neither goods nor money obeyed purely economic forces and did not move as formerly to the areas in which each was most valuable. The chief result was a complete mal-distribution of gold, a condition which became acute after 1928 and which by 1933 had forced most countries off the gold standard. Modifications of productive and commercial organization and of financial practices made it almost impossible after 1919 to restore the financial system of 1914. Yet this is what was attempted. Instead of seeking to set up a new financial organization adapted to the modified economic organization, bankers and politicians insisted that the old prewar system should be restored.

This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations.** Each central bank, in the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. **International Bankers Seek and Make Agreements on** **All the Major Financial Problems of the World** **In each country the power of the central bank rested largely on its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a whole the power of the central bankers rested very largely on their control of loans and of gold flows.** In [this] system, these central bankers were able to mobilize resources to assist each other through the B.I.S. [Bank for International Settlements], where payments between central banks could be made by bookkeeping adjustments between the accounts which the central banks of the world kept there. **The B.I.S. as a private institution was owned by the seven chief central banks and was operated by the heads of these, who together formed its governing board.** Each of these kept a substantial deposit at the B.I.S., and periodically settled payments among themselves (and thus between the major countries of the world) by bookkeeping in order to avoid shipments of gold. **They made agreements on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans, payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe.** **The Bank for International Settlements Becomes the Mechanism for Allowing the****Three Financial Centers of the World to Act", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:43:f6f04ffe367b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8807, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "settled payments among themselves (and thus between the major countries of the world) by bookkeeping in order to avoid shipments of gold. **They made agreements on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans, payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe.** **The Bank for International Settlements Becomes the Mechanism for Allowing the****Three Financial Centers of the World to Act As One** **The B.I.S. is generally regarded as the apex of the structure of financial capitalism whose remote origins go back to the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 and the Bank of France in 1803.** As a matter of fact its establishment in 1929 was rather an indication that the centralized world financial system of 1914 was in decline. **It was set up ... to remedy the decline of London as the world's financial center by providing a mechanism by which a world with three chief financial centers in London, New York, and Paris could still operate as one. **The B.I.S. was [an] effort to cope with the problems arising from the growth of a number of centers. It was intended to be the world cartel of ever-growing national financial powers by assembling the nominal heads of these national financial centers. **Montagu Norman Was the Commander-in-Chief of the** **World System of Banking Control** **The commander in chief of the world system of banking control was Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up by the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle in all matters of government and business.** In government, the power of the Bank of England [created] a considerable restriction on political action as early as 1819, but an effort to break this power by a modification of the bank's charter in 1844 failed. **In 1852, Gladstone, then chancellor of the Exchequer and later prime minister, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\"** **The Currency Dictator of Europe** **This power of the Bank of England and of its governor was admitted by most qualified observers.** **In January, 1924, Reginald McKenna, who had been chancellor of the Exchequer in 1915-1916, as chairman of the board of the Midland Bank told its stockholders: \"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do, create money....

Montagu Norman's position may be gathered from the fact that his predecessors in the governorship, almost a hundred of them, had served two-year terms, increased rarely, in time of crisis, to three or even four years. But Norman held the position for twenty-four years (1920-1944), during which he became the chief architect of the liquidation of Britain's global preeminence. **Norman Viewed Governments and Democracy As ****Threats to the Money Power** **Norman was a strange man whose mental outlook was one of successfully suppressed hysteria or even paranoia. He had no use for governments and feared democracy. Both of these seemed to him to be threats to private banking, and thus to all that was proper and precious in human life. Strong-willed, tireless, and ruthless, he viewed his life as a kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of ... [sound] money.** When he rebuilt the Bank of England, he constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend itself against any popular revolt, with the sacred gold reserves hidden in deep vaults below the level of underground waters which could be released to cover them by pressing a button on the governor's desk. For much of his life Norman rushed about the world by fast steamship, covering tens of thousands of miles each year, often traveling incognito, concealed by a black slouch hat and a long black cloak, under the assumed name of \"Professor Skinner.\" His embarkations and debarkations onto and off the fastest ocean liners of the day, sometimes through the freight hatch, were about as unobserved as the somewhat similar", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:45:c16426b3f436", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8809, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "to cover them by pressing a button on the governor's desk.

Davison, who made him secretary of the Bankers Trust Company of New York (in succession to Thomas W. Lamont) in 1904, used him as Morgan's agent in the banking rearrangements following the crash of 1907, and made him vice-president of the Bankers Trust (still in succession to Lamont) in 1909. **He became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the joint nominee of Morgan and of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company in 1914. Two years later, Strong met Norman for the first time, and they at once made an agreement to work in cooperation for the financial practices they both revered.** These financial practices were explicitly stated many times in the voluminous correspondence between these two men and in many conversations they had, both in their work and at their leisure (they often spent their vacations together for weeks, usually in the south of France). **Norman and Strong Seek to Operate Central Banks Free from** **Any Political Control** In the 1920's, they were determined to use the financial power of Britain and of the United States to force all the major countries of the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central banks free from all political control, with **all questions of international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks without interference from governments.** **Norman and Strong Were Mere Agents of the Powerful Bankers** **Who Remained Behind the Scenes and Operated in Secret** **It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance.

These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks. ** **This dominance of investment bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and investment funds in their own countries and throughout the world. They could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own countries by their influence over the flow of current funds through bank loans, the discount rate, and the re-discounting of commercial debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current government loans and the play of the international exchanges. ** **Almost all of this power was exercised by the personal influence and prestige of men who had demonstrated their ability in the past to bring off successful financial coupe, to keep their word, to remain cool in a crisis, and to share their winning opportunities with their associates. In this system the Rothschilds had been preeminent during much of the nineteenth century, but, at the end of that century, they were being replaced by J. P. Morgan whose central office was in New York, although it was always operated as if it were in London (where it had, indeed, originated as George Peabody and Company in 1838).** Old J. P. Morgan died in 1913, but was succeeded by his son of the same name (who had been trained in the London branch until 1901), while the chief decisions in the firm were increasingly made by Thomas W. Lamont after 1924. But these relationships can be described better on a national basis later. At the present stage we must follow the efforts of the central bankers to compel the world to return to the gold standard of 1914 in the postwar conditions following 1918. **International Banker's Viewpoints Expressed in** **Government Reports and Conferences** The bankers' point of view was clearly expressed in a series of government reports and international conferences from 1918 to 1933.

These and many other statements and reports called vainly for a free international gold standard, for balanced budgets, for restoration of the exchange rates and reserve ratios customary before 1914, for reductions in taxes and government spending, and for a cessation of all government interference in economic activity either domestic or international. But none of these studies made any effort to assess the fundamental changes in economic, commercial, and political life since 1914. And none gave any indication of a realization that a financial system must adapt itself to such changes. Instead, they all implied that if men would only give up their evil ways and impose the financial system of 1914 on the world, the changes would be compelled to reverse their direction and go back to the conditions of 1914. **Financial Capitalists Discover New Ways to Make Money Out of Nothing** [Financial capitalism] invested capital not because it desired to increase the output of goods or services but because it desired to float issues (frequently excess issues) of securities on this productive basis. It built railroads in order to sell securities, not in order to transport goods; it constructed great steel corporations to sell securities, not in order to make steel, and so on. But, incidentally, it greatly increased the transport of goods, the output of steel, and the production of other goods. **By the middle of the stage of financial capitalism, however, the organization of financial capitalism had evolved to a highly sophisticated level of security promotion and speculation which did not require any productive investment as a basis. Corporations were built upon corporations in the form of holding companies, so that securities were issued in huge quantities, bringing profitable fees and commissions to financial capitalists without any increase in economic production whatever. ** **Indeed, these financial capitalists discovered that they could not only make killings out of the issuing of such securities, they could also make killings out of the bankruptcy of such corporations, through the fees and commissions of reorganization. A very pleasant cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, flotation, bankruptcy began to be practiced by these financial capitalists. The more excessive the flotation, the greater the profits, and the more imminent the bankruptcy. The more frequent the bankruptcy, the greater the profits of reorganization and the sooner the opportunity of another excessive flotation with its accompanying profits.** This excessive stage reached its highest peak only in the United States.

The more frequent the bankruptcy, the greater the profits of reorganization and the sooner the opportunity of another excessive flotation with its accompanying profits.** This excessive stage reached its highest peak only in the United States. In Europe it was achieved only in isolated cases. **Finance Capitalism Opened the Way for Centralization of World** **Economic Control in the Hands of the International Banking Fraternity** **The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and a use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups. This concentration of power, however, could be achieved only by using methods which planted the seeds which grew into monopoly capitalism.** Financial control could be exercised only imperfectly through credit control and interlocking directorates. In order to strengthen such control, some measure of stock ownership was necessary. But stock ownership was dangerous to banks because their funds consisted more of deposits (that is, short-term obligations) than of capital (or long-term obligations). This meant that banks which sought economic control through stock ownership were putting short-term obligations into long-term holdings. This was safe only so long as these latter could be liquidated rapidly at a price high enough to pay short-term obligations as they presented themselves. But these holdings of securities were bound to become frozen because both the economic and the financial systems were deflationary. The economic system was deflationary because power production and modern technology gave a great increase in the supply of real wealth. This meant that in the long run the control by banks was doomed by the progress of technology. The financial system was also deflationary because of the bankers' insistence on the gold standard, with all that this implies. ** Money Power Creates an Ingenious Plan to Create and ****Control Giant Monopolies** To escape from this dilemma, the financial capitalists acted upon two fronts. On the business side, they sought to sever control from ownership of securities, believing they could hold the former and relinquish the latter. On the industrial side, they sought to advance monopoly and restrict production, thus keeping prices up and their security holdings liquid. **The efforts of financiers to separate ownership from control were aided by the great capital demands of modern industry. Such demands for capital made necessary the corporation form of business organization. **This inevitably brings together the capital owned by a large number of persons to create an enterprise controlled by a small number of persons. The financiers did all they could to make the former number as large as possible and the latter number as small as possible.

The financiers did all they could to make the former number as large as possible and the latter number as small as possible. The former was achieved by stock splitting, issuing securities of low par value, and by high-pressure security salesmanship. The latter was achieved by plural-voting stock, nonvoting stock, pyramiding of holding companies, election of directors by cooptation, and similar techniques. **The result of this was that larger and larger aggregates of wealth fell into the control of smaller and smaller groups of men.** ** Money Power Used Monopoly Capitalism to ****Increase Wealth and Power** While financial capitalism was thus weaving the intricate pattern of modern corporation law and practice on one side, it was establishing monopolies and cartels on the other. Both helped to dig the grave of financial capitalism and pass the reins of economic control on to the newer monopoly capitalism. **On one side, the financiers freed the controllers of business from the owners of business, but on the other side, this concentration gave rise to monopoly conditions which freed the controllers from the banks.** The date at which any country shifted to financial capitalism and later shifted to monopoly capitalism depended on the supply of capital available to business. These dates could be hastened or retarded by government action. In the United States the onset of monopoly capitalism was retarded by the government's antimonopoly legislation, while in Germany it was hastened by the cartel laws. The real key to the shift rested on the control of money flows, especially of investment funds. These controls, which were held by investment bankers in 1900, were eclipsed by other sources of funds and capital, such as insurance, retirement and investment funds, and, above all, by those flows resulting from the fiscal policies of governments. Efforts by the older private investment bankers to control these new channels of funds had varying degrees of success, but, in general, financial capitalism was destroyed by two events: (1) the ability of industry to finance its own capital needs because** **of the increased profits arising from the decreased competition established by financial capitalism, and (2) the economic crisis engendered by the deflationary policies resulting from financial capitalism's obsession with the gold standard. **Chapter 65 - American Confusions, 1945-1950** **The Right's Fairy Tale Does Have a Modicum of Truth** **There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act.** In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:50:d80ed96ceb44", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8814, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "by financial capitalism, and (2) the economic crisis engendered by the deflationary policies resulting from financial capitalism's obsession with the gold standard. **Chapter 65 - American Confusions, 1945-1950** **The Right's Fairy Tale Does Have a Modicum of Truth** **There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act.** In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. **I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records**.** I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies** (notably to its belief that England was an Atlantic rather than a European Power and must be allied, or even federated, with the United States and must remain isolated from Europe), **but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.** **The Round Table Groups Have Played a Very Significant** **Role in the History of the U.S.** The Round Table Groups have already been mentioned in this book several times, notably in connection with the formation of the British Commonwealth in chapter 4 and in the discussion of appeasement in chapter 12 (\"the Cliveden Set\"). At the risk of some repetition, the story will be summarized here, because the American branch of this organization (sometimes called the \"Eastern Establishment') has played a very significant role in the history of the United States in the last generation. **The Original Purpose of the Round Table Groups** **The Round Table Groups were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups organized by Lionel Curtis, Philip H. Kerr (Lord Lothian), and (Sir) William S. Marris in 1908-1911. This was done on behalf of Lord Milner, the dominant Trustee of the Rhodes Trust in the two decades 1905-1925. The original purpose of these groups was to seek to federate the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902) and William T.

Lamont, Jerome D. Greene, Erwin D. Canham of the *Christian Science Monitor, *and others). The attitudes of the various groups were coordinated by frequent visits and discussions and by a well-informed and totally anonymous quarterly magazine, *The Round Table, *whose first issue, largely written by Philip Kerr, appeared in November 1910. **The Leaders of the Round Table Groups** The leaders of this group were: Milner, until his death in 1925, followed by Curtis (1872-1955), Robert H, (Lord) Brand (brother-in-law of Lady Astor) until his death in 1963, and now Adam D. Marris, son of Sir William and Brand's successor as managing director of Lazard Brothers bank. The original intention had been to have collegial leadership, but Milner was too secretive and headstrong to share the role. He did so only in the period 1913-1919 when he held regular meetings with some of his closest friends to coordinate their activities as a pressure group in the struggle with Wilhelmine Germany. After Milner's death in 1925, the leadership was largely shared by the survivors of Milner's \"Kindergarten,\" that is, the group of young Oxford men whom he used as civil servants in his reconstruction of South Africa in 1901-1910. Brand was the last survivor of the \"Kindergarten\"; since his death, the greatly reduced activities of the organization have been exercised largely through the Editorial Committee of *The Round Table *magazine under Adam Marris. **Financial Backers of the Found Table Groups** **Money for the widely ramified activities of this organization came originally from the associates and followers of Cecil Rhodes, chiefly from the Rhodes Trust itself, and from wealthy associates such as the Beit brothers, from Sir Abe Bailey, and (after 1915) from the Astor family. Since 1925 there have been substantial contributions from wealthy individuals and from foundations and firms associated with the international banking fraternity, especially the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, and other organizations associated with J. P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families, and the associates of Lazard Brothers and of Morgan, Grenfell, and Company.** **The Existing Financial Network in New York and London** The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers.

Morgan who moved from London to join his father in New York. **Instead, Milner became director of a number of public banks, chiefly the London Joint Stock Bank, corporate precursor of the Midland Bank. He became one of the greatest political and financial powers in England, with his disciples strategically placed throughout England in significant places, such as the editorship of *The Times, *the editorship of *The Observer, *the managing directorship of Lazard Brothers, various administrative posts, and even Cabinet positions. Ramifications were established in politics, high finance, Oxford and London universities, periodicals, the civil service, and tax-exempt foundations.** **Front Organizations Established in Key Countries** At the end of the war of 1914, it became clear that the organization of this system had to be greatly extended. Once again the task was entrusted to Lionel Curtis who established, in England and each dominion, a front organization to the existing local Round Table Group. This front organization, called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. **In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J. P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group. The American organizers were dominated by the large number of Morgan \"experts,\" including Lamont and Beer, who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there became close friends with the similar group of English \"experts\" which had been recruited by the Milner group.** **J. P. Morgan and Company Were the Center of the** **Round Table Group in America** **On this basis, which was originally financial and goes back to George Peabody, there grew up in the twentieth century a power structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply into university life, the press, and the practice of foreign policy. In England the center was the Round Table Group, while in the United States it was J. P. Morgan and Company or its local branches in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland.** Some rather incidental examples of the operations of this structure are very revealing, just because they are incidental. For example, it set up in Princeton a reasonable copy of the Round Table Group's chief Oxford headquarters, All Souls College.

It is reflected in the fact that such Wall Street luminaries as John W. Davis, Lewis Douglas, Jock Whitney, and Douglas Dillon were appointed to be American ambassadors in London. **The Double International Network Extended into New Countries through** **Institute of International Affairs** This double international network in which the Round Table groups formed the semi-secret or secret nuclei of the Institutes of International Affairs was extended into a third network in 1925, organized by the same people for the same motives. Once again the mastermind was Lionel Curtis, and the earlier Round Table Groups and Institutes of International Affairs were used as nuclei for the new network. However, this new organization for Pacific affairs was extended to ten countries, while the Round Table Groups existed only in seven. The new additions, ultimately China, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and Soviet Russia, had Pacific councils set up from scratch. In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, Pacific councils, interlocked and dominated by the Institutes of International Affairs, were set up. In England, Chatham House served as the English center for both nets, while in the United States the two were parallel creations (not subordinate) of the Wall Street allies of the Morgan Bank.

The financial difficulties of the IPR Councils in the British Dominions in the depression of 1929-1935 resulted in a very revealing effort to save money, when the local Institute of International Affairs absorbed the local Pacific Council, both of which were, in a way, expensive and needless fronts for the local Round Table groups. **The Chief Aim of the Elaborate and Semi-secret Organization** **The chief aims of this elaborate, semi-secret organization were ... to coordinate the international activities and outlooks of all the English-speaking world into one (which would largely, it is true, be that of the London group); to work to ... help backward, colonial, and underdeveloped areas to advance toward stability, law and order, and prosperity along lines somewhat similar to those taught at Oxford and the University of London.** These organizations and their financial backers were in no sense reactionary or Fascistic persons, as Communist propaganda would like to depict them. Quite the contrary. They were gracious and cultured gentlemen of ... social experience who were much concerned with the freedom of expression of minorities and the rule of law for all, who constantly thought in terms of Anglo-American solidarity, of political partition and federation, and who were convinced that they could gracefully civilize the Boers of South Africa, the Irish, the Arabs, and the Hindus, and who are largely responsible for the partitions of Ireland, Palestine, and India, as well as the federations of South Africa, Central Africa, and the West Indies. Their desire to win over the opposition by cooperation worked with Smuts but failed with Hertzog, worked with Gandhi but failed with Menon.... If their failures now loom larger than their successes, this should not be allowed to conceal the high motives with which they attempted both. **Chapter 77 - Conclusion** **Tragedy and Hope?

They can be avoided in the future by turning from ... nineteenth-century characteristics ... and going back to other characteristics that our Western society has always regarded as virtues: generosity, compassion, cooperation, rationality, and foresight, and finding an increased role in human life for love, spirituality, charity, and self-discipline. ** We now know fairly well how to control the increase in population, how to produce wealth and reduce poverty or disease. We may, in the near future, know how to postpone senility and death. It certainly should be clear to those who have their eyes open that violence, extermination, and despotism do not solve problems for anyone and that victory and conquest are delusions, as long as they are merely physical and materialistic. **Some things we clearly do not yet know, including the most important of all, which is how to bring up children to form them into mature, responsible adults.** But on the whole we do know now, as we have already shown, that we can avoid continuing the horrors of 1914-1915, and on that basis alone we may be optimistic over our ability to go back to the tradition of our Western society and to resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity. **Note:** This is a 40-page summary. **For a more concise 10-page summary, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history).** For a 128-page summary, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/tragedy_and_hope_quigley_129pg.pdf).

One reason for this success has been its economic organization, [which] has passed through six successive stages, of which at least four are called \"capitalism.\" Each stage created the conditions which tended to bring about the next stage. The [first stage] of self-sufficient agrarian units (manors) was in a society organized so that its upper ranks-the lords, lay and ecclesiastical-found their desires for necessities so well met that they sought to exchange their surpluses of necessities for luxuries of remote origin. This gave rise to a trade in foreign luxuries (spices, fine textiles, fine metals) which was the first evidence of the stage of commercial capitalism. In this second stage, mercantile profits and widening markets created a demand for textiles and other goods which could be met only by application of power to production. This gave the third stage: industrial capitalism. The stage of industrial capitalism soon gave rise to such an insatiable demand for heavy fixed capital, like railroad lines, steel mills, shipyards, and so on, that these investments could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors.

This gave the third stage: industrial capitalism. The stage of industrial capitalism soon gave rise to such an insatiable demand for heavy fixed capital, like railroad lines, steel mills, shipyards, and so on, that these investments could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and investment banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief parts of the industrial system, since they provided capital to it. This gave rise to financial capitalism. **The control of financial capitalism was used to integrate the industrial system into ever-larger units with interlinking financial controls. This made possible a reduction of competition with a resulting increase in profits. As a result, the industrial system soon found that it was again able to finance its own expansion from its own profits, and, with this achievement, financial controls were weakened, and the stage of monopoly capitalism arrived. ** In this fifth stage, great industrial units, working together either directly or through cartels and trade associations, were in a position to exploit the majority of the people. The result was a great economic crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state-the minority hoping to use political power to defend their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority. This dualist struggle dwindled with the rise of economic and social pluralism after 1945. **The Primary Goal of Capitalism** Capitalism provides very powerful motivations for economic activity because it associates economic motivations so closely with self-interest. But this same feature, which is a source of strength in providing economic motivation through the pursuit of profits, is also a source of weakness owing to the fact that so self-centered a motivation contributes very readily to a loss of economic coordination. Each individual, just because he is so powerfully motivated by self-interest, easily loses sight of the role which his own activities play in the economic system as a whole, and tends to act as if his activities *were *the whole, with inevitable injury to that whole. **Capitalism, because it seeks profits as its primary goal, is never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. Any of these may be achieved under capitalism, and any (or all) of them may he sacrificed and lost under capitalism, depending on this relationship to the primary goal of capitalist activity-the pursuit of profits. During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at various times, contributed both to the achievement and to the destruction of these other social goals.** [The] stage of commercial capitalism", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:1:6fe9ab39e702", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8823, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift.

During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at various times, contributed both to the achievement and to the destruction of these other social goals.** [The] stage of commercial capitalism became institutionalized into a restrictive system, sometimes called \"mercantilism,\" in which merchants sought to gain profits, not from the movements of goods but from restricting the movements of goods. Thus the pursuit of profits, which had earlier led to increased prosperity by increasing trade and production, became a restriction on both trade and production, because profit became an end in itself rather than an accessory mechanism in the economic system as a whole. In the course of time, however, some merchants began to shift their attention from the goods aspect of commercial interchange to the other, monetary, side of the exchange. They began to accumulate the profits of these transactions, and became increasingly concerned, not with the shipment and exchange of goods, but with the shipment and exchange of moneys. In time they became concerned with the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and their activities, advancing money for both, at high interest rates, secured by claims on ships or goods as collateral for repayment. **The Operations of Banking Were Concealed So** **They Appeared Difficult to Master** In sum, specialization of economic activities, by breaking up the economic process, had made it possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the process and, by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest. The process was not only broken up into producers, exchangers, and consumers but there were also two kinds of exchangers (one concerned with goods, the other with money), with almost antithetical, *short-term, *aims. The problems which inevitably arose could be solved and the system reformed only by reference to the system as a whole. Unfortunately, however, three parts of the system, concerned with the production, transfer, and consumption of goods, were concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them simply by examining them, while **the operations of banking and finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves did everything they could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider.** In the course of time the central fact of the developing economic system, the relationship between goods and money, became clear, at least to bankers.

This relationship, the price system, depended upon five things: the supply and the demand for goods, the supply and the demand for money, and the speed of exchange between money and goods. An increase in three of these (demand for goods, supply of money, speed of circulation) would move the prices of goods up and the value of money down. This inflation was objectionable to bankers, although desirable to producers and merchants. On the other hand, a decrease in the same three items would be deflationary and would please bankers, worry producers and merchants, and delight consumers (who obtained more goods for less money). The other factors worked in the opposite direction, so that an increase in them (supply of goods, demand for money, and slowness of circulation or exchange) would be deflationary [and vice versa]. Such changes of prices, either inflationary or deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Over that long period, their power to modify men's lives and human history has been increasing. **Bankers Obsessed With Maintaining Value of Money** Rising prices benefit debtors and injure creditors, while falling prices do the opposite. A debtor called upon to pay a debt at a time when prices are higher than when he contracted the debt must yield up less goods and services than he obtained at the earlier date, on a lower price level when he borrowed the money. A creditor, such as a bank, which has lent money-equivalent to a certain quantity of goods and services-on one price level, gets back the same amount of money-but a smaller quantity of goods and services-when repayment comes at a higher price level, because the money repaid is then less valuable. This is why** bankers, as creditors in money terms, have been obsessed with maintaining the value of money, although the reason they have traditionally given for this obsession-that \"sound money\" maintains \"business confidence\"-has been propagandist rather than accurate.** Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with the richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and more cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies, war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became the financiers and financial advisers of governments.

Moreover, since their relationships with governments were always in monetary terms and not real terms, and since they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges between one country's money and another,** they used their power and influence to do two things: (1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of a strictly limited commodity-ultimately gold; and (2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of governments and political authority, on the ground that they would be handled better by private banking interests.** **Bankers Create Money Out of Nothing** For generations men had sought to avoid the one drawback of gold, its heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific pieces of gold. We call such pieces of paper gold certificates. Such a certificate entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece of gold on demand, but in view of the convenience of paper, only a small fraction of certificate holders ever did make such demands. It early became clear that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to cover the fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment; accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business purposes, or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates could be issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of demands against them. Such an excess volume of paper claims against reserves we now call bank notes. **In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the reserves available means that bankers were creating money out of nothing.** The same thing could be done in another way, not by note-issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. **Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in actual money ... no more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon *and cashed; ***the rest could be used for loans, and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. **The Dynasties of International Bankers** **The merchant bankers of London ... brought into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:4:0cd57a450112", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8826, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon *and cashed; ***the rest could be used for loans, and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. **The Dynasties of International Bankers** **The merchant bankers of London ... brought into their financial network the provincial banking centers, organized as commercial banks and savings banks, as well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a single financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other. ** The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. The greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) of Frankfort, whose male descendants, for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces. In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic activities of international bankers, we must not totally ignore their other attributes. They were, especially in later generations, cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic. They were usually highly civilized, cultured gentlemen, patrons of education and of the arts, so that today colleges, professorships, opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections still reflect their munificence. For these purposes they set a pattern of endowed foundations which still surround us today. ** Bankers Felt Politicians Could Not Be Trusted** **With the Monetary System** The influence of financial capitalism and of the international bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on governments, but could have done neither if it had not been able to persuade both these to accept two \"axioms\" of its own ideology. Both of these were based on the assumption that politicians were too weak and too subject to temporary popular pressures to be trusted with control of the money system; accordingly, the sanctity of all values and the soundness of money must be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold and by allowing bankers to control the supply of money. **To do this it was necessary to conceal, or even to mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation.** In most countries the central bank was surrounded closely by the almost invisible private investment banking firms.

These, like the planet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the dazzle emitted by the central bank which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a close observer could hardly fail to notice the close *private *associations between these private, international bankers and the central bank itself. Two of the five factors which determined the value of money are the supply and the demand for money. The supply of money in a single country was subject to no centralized, responsible control in most countries over recent centuries. Instead, there were a variety of controls of which some could be influenced by bankers, some could be influenced by the government, and some could hardly be influenced by either. **Central banks can usually vary the amount of money in circulation by \"open market operations\" or by influencing the discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a central bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market.** If it buys, it releases money into the economic system; if it sells it reduces the amount of money in the community. The change is greater than the price paid for the securities [due to the [fractional reserve system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking)]. **Central banks can also change the quantity of money by influencing the credit policies of other banks. **This can be done by various methods, such as changing the re-discount rate or changing reserve requirements. By changing the re-discount rate, we mean the interest rate which central banks charge lesser banks for loans. By raising the re-discount rate, the central bank *forces *the lesser bank to raise its discount rate in order to operate at a profit; such a raise in interest rates tends to reduce the demand for credit and thus the amount of deposits (money). Lowering the re-discount rate *permits *an opposite result. The powers of governments over the quantity of money are of various kinds, and include (*a*) control over a central bank, (*b*) control over public taxation, and (*c*) control over public spending. The control of governments over central banks varies greatly from one country to another, but on the whole has been increasing. Since most central banks have been (technically) private institutions, this control is frequently based on custom rather than on law.

Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community and is usually a deflationary force; government spending tends to increase the amount of money in a community and is usually an inflationary force. The total effects of a government's policy will depend on which item is greater. An unbalanced budget will be inflationary; a budget with a surplus will be deflationary. ** Money Power - Controlled by International Investment Bankers - Dominates Business and Government** **On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially the Money Power controlled by the international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate business, especially in activities and in areas where industry could not finance its own needs for capital, because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse to supply such capital. Thus, Rothschild interests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at least 26,000 miles of American railroads. ** Such bankers went further than this. In return for flotations of securities of industry, they took seats on the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and finance companies. From these lesser institutions they funneled capital to enterprises which yielded control and away from those who resisted. These firms were controlled through interlocking directorships, holding companies, and lesser banks. They engineered amalgamations and generally reduced competition, until by the early twentieth century many activities were so monopolized that they could raise their noncompetitive prices above costs to obtain sufficient profits to become self-financing. But before that stage was reached a relatively small number of bankers were in positions of immense influence in European and American economic life. As early as 1909, Walter Rathenau, who was in a position to know (since he had inherited from his father control of the German General Electric Company and held scores of directorships himself), said, \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.\" **The Power of Investment Bankers Over Governments** The power of investment bankers over governments rests on a number of factors, of which the most significant, perhaps, is the need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well as long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances to smooth over the discrepancies between their irregular and intermittent incomes and their periodic and persistent outgoes, so a government has to go to merchant bankers (or institutions", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:7:1f3931acb194", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8829, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "Power of Investment Bankers Over Governments** The power of investment bankers over governments rests on a number of factors, of which the most significant, perhaps, is the need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well as long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances to smooth over the discrepancies between their irregular and intermittent incomes and their periodic and persistent outgoes, so a government has to go to merchant bankers (or institutions controlled by them) to tide over the shallow places caused by irregular tax receipts. As experts in government bonds, the international bankers not only handled the necessary advances, but provided advice to government officials and, on many occasions, placed their own members in official posts for varied periods to deal with special problems. This is so widely accepted even today that in 1961 a Republican investment banker became Secretary of the Treasury in a Democratic Administration in Washington without significant comment from any direction. **Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during the age of financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not something about which anyone talked freely, but it has been admitted frequently enough by those on the inside**, especially in England. In 1852 Gladstone, chancellor of the Exchequer, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" On September 26, 1921, *The Financial Times *wrote, \"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" **Montagu Norman and J. P. Morgan Dominate the Financial World** In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other pressures. **Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from bankers whom they considered to be experts in the field. The history of the last century shows, as we shall see later, that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave to industrialists, was consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen, and the people generally. ** **Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even levels of business activity.** The powers of these international bankers reached their peak in the last decade of their supremacy, 1919-1931, when Montagu Norman and J. P. Morgan dominated not only the financial world but international relations and other matters as well.

On one occasion ... Mr. Norman is reported to have said, \"I hold the hegemony of the world.\" It might be added that Governor Norman rarely acted in major world problems without consulting with J. P. Morgan's representatives. **Chapter 9 - The British Imperial Crisis** Britain acquired the world's greatest empire because it possessed certain advantages which other countries lacked. We mention three of these advantages: (1) that it was an island, (2) that it was in the Atlantic, and (3) that its social traditions at home produced the will and the talents for imperial acquisition. **Cecil Rhodes Organized a Secret Society in 1891** [Cecil] Rhodes (1853-1902) feverishly exploited the diamond and goldfields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister of the Cape Colony (1890-1896), contributed money to political parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and in South Africa, and sought to win a strip of British territory across Africa from the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt and to join these two extremes together with a telegraph line and ultimately with a Cape-to-Cairo Railway. Rhodes inspired devoted support for his goals from others in South Africa and in England. With financial support from Lord Rothschild and Alfred Beit, he was able to monopolize the diamond mines of South Africa as De Beers Consolidated Mines and to build up a great gold mining enterprise as Consolidated Gold Fields. In the middle 1890's Rhodes had a personal income of at least a million pounds sterling a year [equivalent to about $100 million a year in current U.S. dollars] which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his account. **[An] association was formally established on February 5, 1891, when Rhodes and [William] Stead organized a secret society of which Rhodes had been dreaming for sixteen years.** In this secret society Rhodes was to be leader; Stead, Brett, and Milner were to form an executive committee; Arthur (Lord) Balfour, (Sir) Harry Johnston, Lord Rothschild, Albert (Lord) Grey, and others were listed as potential members of a \"Circle of Initiates\"; while there was to be an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" (later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization). **In 1919 [Rhodes' followers] founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) for which the chief financial supporters were Sir Abe Bailey and the Astor family", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:9:8e90e928ba42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8831, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Milner were to form an executive committee; Arthur (Lord) Balfour, (Sir) Harry Johnston, Lord Rothschild, Albert (Lord) Grey, and others were listed as potential members of a \"Circle of Initiates\"; while there was to be an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" (later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization). **In 1919 [Rhodes' followers] founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) for which the chief financial supporters were Sir Abe Bailey and the Astor family (owners of *The Times). *Similar Institutes of International Affairs were established in the chief British dominions and in the United States (where it is known as the Council on Foreign Relations) in the period 1919-1927.** **The power and influence of this Rhodes-Milner group in British imperial affairs and in foreign policy since 1889, although not widely recognized, can hardly be exaggerated. We might mention as an example that this group dominated *The Times *from 1890 to 1912, and has controlled it completely since 1912 (except for the years 1919-1922).** In spite of the terms of the Rhodes wills, Rhodes himself was not a racist. Nor was he a political democrat. He worked as easily and as closely with Jews, black natives, or Boers as he did with English. His greatest weakness rested on the fact that his passionate attachment to his goals made him overly tolerant in regard to methods. He did not hesitate to use either bribery or force to attain his ends if he judged they would be effective. **Chapter 20 - The Period of Stabilization, 1922-1930** **America Becomes the World's Greatest Creditor** ** By 1914 Britain's supremacy as financial center, as commercial market, as creditor, and as merchant shipper was being threatened. **At this critical stage in Britain's development, the World War occurred. This had a double result as far as this subject is concerned. It forced Britain to postpone indefinitely any reform of her industrial system to adjust it to more modern trends; and it speeded up the development of these trends so that what might have occurred in twenty years was done instead in five. **The war changed the position of the United States in respect to the rest of the world from that of a debtor owing about $3 billion to that of a creditor owed $4 billion. This does not include intergovernmental debts of about $10 billion owed to the United States as a result of the war. **At the same time, Britain's position changed from a creditor owed about $18 billion to a creditor owed about $13.5 billion. In addition, Britain was owed about $8 billion in war debts from her Allies ... and owed to the United States war debts of well over $54 billion.

Most of these war debts and reparations were sharply reduced after 1920, but the net result for Britain was a drastic change in her position in respect to the United States. The basic economic organization of the world was modified in other ways. The more backward areas of Europe and the world had been industrialized to a great degree and were unwilling to fall back to a position in which they would obtain industrial products from Britain, Germany, or the United States in return for their raw materials and food. This refusal was made more painful for both sides by the fact that these backward areas had increased their outputs of raw materials and food so greatly that the total could hardly have been sold even if they had been willing to buy all their industrial products from their prewar sources. The result was a situation where all countries were eager to sell and reluctant to buy, and sought to achieve these mutually irreconcilable ends by setting up subsidies and bounties on exports, tariffs, and restrictions on imports, with disastrous results on world trade. **The only sensible solution to this problem of excessive productive capacity would have been a substantial rise in domestic standards of living, but this would have required a fundamental reapportionment of the national income so that claims to the product of the excess capacity would go to those masses eager to consume, rather than continue to go to the minority desiring to save. Such a reform was rejected by the ruling groups in both \"advanced\" and \"backward\" countries, so that this solution was reached only to a relatively small degree in a relatively few countries.** The system of international payments which had worked ... before 1914 worked only haltingly after that date, and practically ceased to work at all after 1930. The chief cause of these factors was that neither goods nor money obeyed purely economic forces and did not move as formerly to the areas in which each was most valuable. The chief result was a complete mal-distribution of gold, a condition which became acute after 1928 and which by 1933 had forced most countries off the gold standard. ** Money Power Seeks to Create a World System of Financial** **Control in Private Hands Able to Dominate Every Nation on Earth** **The powers of financial capitalism had [a] far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt:11:96a79bbaf79a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8833, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__tragedy_hope_banking_money_history", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "condition which became acute after 1928 and which by 1933 had forced most countries off the gold standard. ** Money Power Seeks to Create a World System of Financial** **Control in Private Hands Able to Dominate Every Nation on Earth** **The powers of financial capitalism had [a] far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations.** Each central bank, in the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. ** Norman Was the Commander-in-Chief of the** **World System of Banking Control** **The commander in chief of the world system of banking control was Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up by the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle in all matters of government and business.** In January, 1924, Reginald McKenna, who had been chancellor of the Exchequer in 1915-1916, as chairman of the board of the Midland Bank told its stockholders: \"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do, create money.... And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people.\" Montagu Norman's position may be gathered from the fact that his predecessors in the governorship, almost a hundred of them, had served two-year terms, increased rarely in time of crisis. But Norman held the position for twenty-four years (1920-1944). **Norman was a strange man whose mental outlook was one of successfully suppressed hysteria or even paranoia.

He became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the joint nominee of Morgan and of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company in 1914. Two years later, Strong met Norman for the first time, and they at once made an agreement to work in cooperation for the financial practices they both revered. In the 1920's, they were determined to use the financial power of Britain and of the United States to force all the major countries of the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central banks free from all political control, with all questions of international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks without interference from governments. **Norman and Strong Were Mere Agents of the Powerful Bankers** **Who Remained Behind the Scenes and Operated in Secret** **It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. ****The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks. ** This dominance of investment bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and investment funds in their own countries and throughout the world.

Morgan whose central office was in New York, although it was always operated as if it were in London (where it had, indeed, originated as George Peabody and Company in 1838). The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and a use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups. ** Money Power Creates an Ingenious Plan to Create and ****Control Giant Monopolies** The financial capitalists [eventually] acted upon two fronts. On the business side, they sought to sever control from ownership of securities, believing they could hold the former and relinquish the latter. On the industrial side, they sought to advance monopoly and restrict production, thus keeping prices up and their security holdings liquid.. The efforts of financiers to separate ownership from control were aided by the great capital demands of modern industry. Such demands for capital made necessary the corporation form of business organization. This inevitably brings together the capital owned by a large number of persons to create an enterprise controlled by a small number of persons. The financiers did all they could to make the former number as large as possible and the latter number as small as possible. **The result of this was that larger and larger aggregates of wealth fell into the control of smaller and smaller groups of men.** While financial capitalism was thus weaving the intricate pattern of modern corporation law and practice on one side, it was establishing monopolies and cartels on the other. Both helped to dig the grave of financial capitalism and pass the reins of economic control on to the newer monopoly capitalism. On one side, the financiers freed the controllers of business from the owners of business, but on the other side, this concentration gave rise to monopoly conditions which freed the controllers from the banks. **Chapter 65 - American Confusions, 1945-1950** **There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network. ****I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records**.** I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.

He was believed to have taken over as the [pilot](/wiki/Aviator) of the [aircraft](/wiki/Aircraft) and made an unsuccessful attempt to crash the plane into either the [White House](/wiki/White_House) or the [U.S. Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol), although the release of the cockpit transcript revealed that [Saeed al-Ghamdi](/wiki/Saeed_al-Ghamdi) had in fact been flying, and the claim of Jarrah's participation has been the subject of much controversy. There are many variations on his name, including **Ziad Samir Al-Jarrah**, **Zaid Jarrahi**, **Ziad Jarrah Jarrat**, and, in Robert Baer's *See No Evil* (2002), **Ziyad Samir Jarrah**. After a wealthy and [secular](/wiki/Secularism) upbringing, Jarrah became involved in the [September 11](/wiki/September_11) attacks in college. Unique among the hijackers, he had a girlfriend and was close to his family. There are disputes concerning whether or not Jarrah was actually on Flight 93, although the [9/11 Commission](/wiki/National_Commission_on_Terrorist_Attacks_Upon_the_United_States) concluded that his was not a case of mistaken identity.

Jarrah was born in [Mazraa](/wiki/Mazraa), [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon), to a wealthy family. His parents were nominally [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim) [Sunnis](/wiki/Sunni), although they lived a [secular](/wiki/Secularism) lifestyle. When he was seven years old, [Israel invaded southern Lebanon](/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War), a fact he referred to later in life. His parents sent him to a [Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) [private school](/wiki/Private_school) in [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut) called La Sagesse, where he volunteered at a camp for disabled children and helped run an anti-drug program. His academic success to this point was mediocre, and his parents arranged for private tutors in [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics), [physics](/wiki/Physics) and [chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry). He remained close to his family; he was apparently the only 9/11 hijacker to have close family ties, including with his uncle [Assem Omar Jarrah](/wiki/Assem_Omar_Jarrah) whose work permit would later be found in the wreckage with Ziad's passport. In his childhood, he had always wanted to fly planes, but his family discouraged this. \"I stopped him from being a pilot,\" his father told the *Wall Street Journal* a week after the attacks. \"I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash.\" [/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg) [/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg) This is the text of a 1998 eMail from Aysel Sengun to Ziad Jarrah In the spring of 1996, Jarrah moved to [Germany](/wiki/Germany) with his cousin Salim to take a course in [German](/wiki/German_language) at the [University of Greifswald](/wiki/University_of_Greifswald) to receive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__ziad_jarrah.txt:0:7e91e51d47be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8838, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__ziad_jarrah.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__ziad_jarrah", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "planes, but his family discouraged this. \"I stopped him from being a pilot,\" his father told the *Wall Street Journal* a week after the attacks. \"I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash.\" [/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg) [/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad-redact.jpg) This is the text of a 1998 eMail from Aysel Sengun to Ziad Jarrah In the spring of 1996, Jarrah moved to [Germany](/wiki/Germany) with his cousin Salim to take a course in [German](/wiki/German_language) at the [University of Greifswald](/wiki/University_of_Greifswald) to receive a certificate needed for foreigners who do not speak German to study in Germany. While sharing an apartment with his cousin, he reportedly attended [discos](/wiki/Disco) and beach parties, and his attendance at the [mosque](/wiki/Mosque) fell off. He met [Aysel Sengn](/wiki/Aysel_Seng%C3%BCn), a [Turkish](/wiki/Turkey) woman studying [dentistry](/wiki/Dentistry), and the two became good friends. They dated on and off for the remainder of his life and lived together briefly, vexing his more religious friends, and celebrating an unofficial wedding on [April 1](/wiki/April_1), [1999](/wiki/1999). In 1997, Jarrah left Greifswald and instead began studying [aerospace engineering](/wiki/Aerospace_engineering) at the [University of Applied Sciences](/wiki/University_of_Applied_Sciences) in [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg), while working at a [Volkswagen](/wiki/Volkswagen) paint shop in nearby [Wolfsburg](/wiki/Wolfsburg). While in Hamburg, he rented an apartment from Rosemarie Canel, who would paint a portrait of him that he would bring back as a gift for his mother that December.[[1]](#_note-0) Jarrah is claimed to have become an associate of the [Hamburg cell](/wiki/Hamburg_cell), although he never seems to have lived with the others, and cannot be confirmed to have ever known them.

They were convinced by [Khalid al-Masri](/wiki/Khalid_al-Masri) and [Mohamedou Ould Slahi](/wiki/Mohamedou_Ould_Slahi) at the last minute to change their plans, and instead traveled to [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan) to meet with [Osama bin Laden](/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden) and train for terrorist attacks. They were told they were on a highly secret mission, and were instructed to return to Germany and enroll in flight school. This account is provided solely from the testimony of captured [al-Qaeda](/wiki/Al-Qaeda) member [Ramzi Binalshibh](/wiki/Ramzi_Binalshibh). In October of 1999 Ziad Jarrah was filmed at [Said Bahaji](/wiki/Said_Bahaji)'s wedding with other 9/11 hijackers, including [Marwan al-Shehhi](/wiki/Marwan_al-Shehhi).[[2]](#_note-1) In early 2000, Jarrah shaved his beard and began to act more secular, according to Sengn. Many of the future hijackers attempted to hide their radicalism and blend in with the population. Jarrah then reported his [passport](/wiki/Passport) stolen in February of 2000 and received a duplicate, just as hijackers Atta and al-Shehhi had done the previous month. Jarrah dropped out of college and began looking at flight schools, as instructed in Afghanistan. He claimed that this was to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot.

Jarrah dropped out of college and began looking at flight schools, as instructed in Afghanistan. He claimed that this was to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot. After looking in several countries, he decided that none of the flight schools in Europe was sufficient, and at the advice of a childhood friend, he prepared to move to the United States.

On [May 21](/wiki/May_21), [2000](/wiki/2000), he was issued a student visa to the United States. On [June 27](/wiki/June_27), [2000](/wiki/2000) he came to the U.S. for the first time, arriving in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia) on a flight from [Munich](/wiki/Munich). He then travelled to [Florida](/wiki/Florida) to attend a flight school. Many of his classmates remember him fondly, describing him as kind and trustworthy, and remember him drinking beer occasionally. He was enrolled for six months, from June 2000 to [January 15](/wiki/January_15), [2001](/wiki/2001). Jarrah was unique among the hijackers in that he did not live with any other hijackers, but rather lived with a German student named Thorsten Biermann. Biermann did not observe Jarrah acting particularly religious or overtly political. Jarrah occasionally flew back to Germany to visit his girlfriend, and called or e-mailed her nearly every day. [/wiki/Image:Jarrah-2000-Flying-Florida.jpg](/wiki/Image:Jarrah-2000-Flying-Florida.jpg) [/wiki/Image:Jarrah-2000-Flying-Florida.jpg](/wiki/Image:Jarrah-2000-Flying-Florida.jpg) Jarrah at a Florida flight school in 2000 Jarrah had obtained his license to fly small planes, and began training to fly large jets late in 2000. He flew to [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut) to visit his family, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend Sengn. He brought her back to the United States for a ten-day visit, and she even attended a flight school session with him. In mid-January of 2001, he again flew to [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut) to visit his father, who was to have open-heart surgery. He then visited his girlfriend Sengn in Germany and came back to the United States again. His behavior was markedly different from the other hijackers, who broke off all familial and romantic relations. On his way back to the U.S., he passed through the [UAE](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) where he was initially reported as having been interviewed by authorities at the request of the [CIA](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency), although the CIA has since denied the claim, and the 9/11 Commission report does not mention it.[[3]](#_note-2) UAE records show that Jarrah mentioned having been in Afghanistan, the only hijacker to have done so.

Sometime in that month it's believed that [Ahmed al-Haznawi](/wiki/Ahmed_al-Haznawi) who arrived on [June 8](/wiki/June_8), moved in with Jarrah, who got a new apartment at 4641 Bougainvilla in [Lauderdale-by-the-Sea](/wiki/Lauderdale-by-the-Sea), after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.[[6]](#_note-5) On [June 25](/wiki/June_25), Jarrah took al-Haznawi to [Holy Cross Hospital](/wiki/Holy_Cross_Hospital) in [Fort Lauderdale, Florida](/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida) on the advice of his landlord Charles Lisa. al-Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf. While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase,[[7]](#_note-6) the media briefly reported it as a sign of [cutaneous anthrax](/wiki/Anthrax) hoping to show a link to the [2001 anthrax attacks](/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks), although the FBI later addressed the rumors stating that \"Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been\".[[8]](#_note-7) In mid July 2001, some of the hijackers and members of the Hamburg cell gathered near [Salou](/wiki/Salou), [Spain](/wiki/Spain), for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. Since hotel records are sparse during some of that time, it is thought that they may have spent considerable time in and around safe houses related to the al-Qaeda leader in Spain, [Imad Yarkas](/wiki/Imad_Yarkas). After 9/11, Spanish investigators followed the trails backwards, and the events they uncovered were chronicled in the Spanish nationwide newspaper [El Pas](/wiki/El_Pa%C3%ADs). Witnesses told Spanish investigators they saw a man who resembled [Marwan al-Shehhi](/wiki/Marwan_al-Shehhi) on [July 17](/wiki/July_17), [2001](/wiki/2001) at the [Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios) [Port Aventura](/wiki/Port_Aventura) theme park next to Salou, Spain.

Back in Germany, it had been Bahaji's 1999 wedding during which Jarrah was filmed. Other witnesses elsewhere had pointed out Bahaji from photos, as one of the men they saw in Spain. But Bahaji also bore a resemblance in appearance to [Mohamed Atta](/wiki/Mohamed_Atta), who was traced to the same areas in Spain through his hotel and travel records. In late July, Jarrah flew to Germany and again met with his fiancee Aysel, the last time she saw him. He arrived back in the United States on [August 5](/wiki/August_5), though other sources indicate that he wrote his pilot's test on August 2nd, having missed his sister's wedding to do so.[[9]](#_note-8) On [August 27](/wiki/August_27) he checked into a [Laurel, Maryland](/wiki/Laurel%2C_Maryland) motel, only a mile away from the Valencia where 4 other hijackers were staying.[[10]](#_note-9) On [September 7](/wiki/September_7), all four of Flight 93 hijackers flew from [Fort Lauderdale](/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale) to [Newark International Airport](/wiki/Newark_International_Airport) aboard [Spirit Airlines](/wiki/Spirit_Airlines). Jarrah and al-Haznawi both received their one-way tickets on [September 5](/wiki/September_5).[[11]](#_note-10) On [September 9](/wiki/September_9),In the early morning hours, he was driving over the speed limit in Maryland.He got pulled over and received a $200 ticket. Jarrah phoned his parents, mentioning that he had received the money order they'd sent five days earlier. He told them he intended to see them on [September 22](/wiki/September_22) for his cousin's wedding, and that he had bought a new suit for the occasion. His landlady later confirmed that Jarrah had shown off the suit to her days earlier. On [September 10](/wiki/September_10), Jarrah sent a letter to his girlfriend, widely interpreted as a [suicide note](/wiki/Suicide_note). The note contained the phrases \"I have done what I had to do\" and \"You should be very proud, it is an honor, and you will see the result, and everyone will be happy.\" Because of an error in the address, the letter was returned to the United States where it was discovered. Some have disputed whether the letter was a suicide note, since it referred to future meetings and the package also contained references to [scuba diving](/wiki/Scuba_diving) instructions.[[12]](#_note-11)[[13]](#_note-12) [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter1.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter1.jpg) Page 1 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter2.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter2.jpg) Page 2 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter3.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter3.jpg) Page 3 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter4.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter4.jpg) Page 4 According to one source, Jarrah had set up a large mock cockpit made of cardboard boxes in his apartment just before the attacks.[[14]](#_note-13) [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ziad_Jarrah&action=edit&section=5)] The attack [/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg) [/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg) Charred passport found among the wreckage of [Flight 93](/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) On the morning of [September 11](/wiki/September_11), [2001](/wiki/2001), Ziad Jarrah boarded [United Airlines Flight 93](/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) without incident, and sat in a first-class seat near", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__ziad_jarrah.txt:4:bc60440ba0c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8842, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__ziad_jarrah.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__ziad_jarrah", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "package also contained references to [scuba diving](/wiki/Scuba_diving) instructions.[[12]](#_note-11)[[13]](#_note-12) [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter1.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter1.jpg) Page 1 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter2.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter2.jpg) Page 2 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter3.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter3.jpg) Page 3 [/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter4.jpg](/wiki/Image:ZiadLetter4.jpg) Page 4 According to one source, Jarrah had set up a large mock cockpit made of cardboard boxes in his apartment just before the attacks.[[14]](#_note-13) [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ziad_Jarrah&action=edit&section=5)] The attack [/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg) [/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg](/wiki/Image:Ziad_Jarrah_Passport_Photo.jpg) Charred passport found among the wreckage of [Flight 93](/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) On the morning of [September 11](/wiki/September_11), [2001](/wiki/2001), Ziad Jarrah boarded [United Airlines Flight 93](/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) without incident, and sat in a first-class seat near the [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit). Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day, and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well. Jarrah is suspected of being the pilot, and a voice heard by [air traffic control](/wiki/Air_traffic_control) telling passengers to remain seated is reported to be Jarrah's. At 9:39 AM, Jarrah announced, \"Uh, this is the captain. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands [unintelligible]. Please remain quiet.\" over the radio.[[15]](#_note-14) At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, and indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was. Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. They realized they had to take the cockpit back from the terrorists or their plane too would be used as a missile. A passenger uprising foiled the terrorist's plans, but failed to save the plane. According to the [August 8](/wiki/August_8), [2003](/wiki/2003) analysis of the plane's [cockpit recordings](/wiki/Flight_data_recorder) by the [United States](/wiki/United_States) investigators, a crowd of passengers tried to break into the cockpit. To try to knock them off balance, Jarrah rolled the plane to the left and right. When this failed, he then pitched the nose forward and back. Nevertheless, the passengers continued their assault on the cockpit door. They used a service trolley as a battering ram and began to destroy the cockpit door. Finally, presumably as the door was giving way, Jarrah was told by a fellow hijacker to crash into the [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania) farmland rather than cede control of the plane. In response, he turned the plane upside down and began his descent. United 93 crashed, at 580 miles per hour (933 km/h), into a reclaimed strip mine at the edge of the woods in [Shanksville, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Shanksville%2C_Pennsylvania) at 10:03:11, 125 miles (200 km) from Washington, D.C. All aboard died. After 9/11, Jarrah's girlfriend Sengn filed a missing person report in [Bochum](/wiki/Bochum).

The landlords and other tenants of the 3-apartment complex claimed that it was the same Ziad Jarrah in the FBI photographs, and that he often carried a camera. Jarrah's personality, background, and activities were not consistent with the other hijackers. He seemed apolitical and irreligious throughout his life, and he was the only hijacker to maintain close ties to his family. He spoke frequently with his very secular Turkish girlfriend Aysel Sengn, and never mentioned the plot or any of the other hijackers to her. He reportedly seemed calm and friendly in the days before the attacks. [Robert Baer](/wiki/Robert_Baer), an ex-CIA case officer, reported a September 2002 meeting in Beirut with \"a relative\" of Jarrah who says: \"I'm not sure Ziyad is really dead. Maybe someone stole his identity. Or maybe he was drugged and someone flew the plane from the ground by remote control. I don't believe Ziyad could do this.\"[[16]](#_note-15) [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ziad_Jarrah&action=edit&section=7)] Authority Inconsistencies On [October 23](/wiki/October_23), [2001](/wiki/2001), [John Ashcroft](/wiki/John_Ashcroft) claimed that Jarrah had shared a Hamburg apartment with [Mohamed Atta](/wiki/Mohamed_Atta) and [Marwan Alshehhi](/wiki/Marwan_Alshehhi), though the [Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times) then announced that none of Jarrah's three apartments in Hamburg had been remotely connected with any of the other hijackers. The FBI and German authorities had initially reported that Jarrah attended another school in Hamburg, that two other hijackers attended, but after Jarrah's family brought out his documentation showing he was enrolled in, and attending classes at, the [University of Applied Sciences](/wiki/University_of_Applied_Sciences), the [FBI](/wiki/FBI) conceded that he had never been there. There were also inconsistencies with Jarrah's supposed locations. When Jarrah was questioned on [January 30](/wiki/January_30), [2001](/wiki/2001), he admitted to having been to Afghanistan and [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan). But the Florida flight school where Jarrah had been studying says he was in school there until [January 15](/wiki/January_15), [2001](/wiki/2001). Either one of these reports is inaccurate, or two people claimed to be the same person. The [9/11 Commission Report](/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report) sheds no light on this discrepancy. Jarrah's family in [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon) claims that he was an innocent passenger on the plane or that possibly his is a case of mistaken identity and that he was not even on the plane. Two days before the hijacking, Jarrah called and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:articles__ziad_jarrah.txt:6:1ca3bf54c7f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8844, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "articles__ziad_jarrah.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "articles__ziad_jarrah", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "had been studying says he was in school there until [January 15](/wiki/January_15), [2001](/wiki/2001).

Jarrah's family in [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon) claims that he was an innocent passenger on the plane or that possibly his is a case of mistaken identity and that he was not even on the plane. Two days before the hijacking, Jarrah called and told his family he would be coming home for a cousin's wedding. \"It makes no sense,\" his uncle Jamal claimed. \"He said he had even bought a new suit for the occasion.\", a purchase which his landlady also remembered.[[17]](#_note-16) The hijacker that day signed his name as \"Zaid Jarrahi\", a form his family claims he never used.[[*citation needed*](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)] Further, the passengers on the plane all reported three hijackers, though it is possible that Jarrah slipped into the cockpit unnoticed during the commotion. The [9/11 Commission](/wiki/9/11_Commission) concluded that Jarrah was present and behind the controls of the plane when it crashed in an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. They do not give any credence to the idea that Jarrah was not the pilot. Certainly, Jarrah has not been seen since the attacks. [DNA fingerprinting](/wiki/DNA_fingerprinting) would settle the controversy, as fragmentary remains of all the hijackers have been found. Jarrah's family has indicated they would be willing to provide DNA samples to US researchers, but the FBI has shown no interest thus far.

This video starts with Lyndon Johnson's attorney stating categorically that Johnson murdered Kennedy to become president and to avoid prison. Johnson's confirmed mistress also states that he \"knew about the assassination and was part of it.\" History Channel was banned from selling or airing this segment again due to a lawsuit by the Johnson family.

Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. Yet the official story continues to claim that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. Strangely enough, few people know that the government does not hold a unified front about the assassination. Below is a summary of the official 1979 report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives on the John Kennedy assassination. **It is a verbatim copy of the \"Summary of Findings and Recommendations\" by this Congressional committee stating clearly that the John F. Kennedy assassination was probably the result of a conspiracy.** You can verify this on the website of the U.S. National Archives at [this link](http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html). Why did this report by Congress on a probable Kennedy assassination conspiracy not get wide media coverage? Why is it that so few people today know about this astonishing report? Could it be that the same forces behind the conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy also exercise great control over the major media?

Kennedy Assassination Facts, Theories **John F. Kennedy Assassination Facts, Theories Author Presents Facts, Theories of John F. Kennedy Assassination** Dear friends, Countless theories attempt to explain the John F. Kennedy assassination. Yet few have taken the painstaking efforts needed to carefully document all of the facts related to the many steps taken by Kennedy which greatly upset the establishment in the lead-up to his assassination. Author James Douglass has now done that in his highly acclaimed *[JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters](http://www.amazon.com/JFK-Unspeakable-Why-Died-Matters/dp/1439193886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381374859&sr=8-1&keywords=JFK+and+the+Unspeakable%3A+Why+He+Died+and+why+it+Matters%2C)*. This may be the most definitive book ever on the many facts and theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The below concise summary of the painstaking work by Douglass both captivates and inspires. **With references and links to verify his statements, Douglass presents numerous revealing facts and powerful evidence that John F. Kennedy took far too many steps towards peace and away from the [secret agendas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption) of his war-hungry generals and rich industrialists.** His behavior simply could not be tolerated by those who stood to lose billions of dollars from his ever-growing resolve to create more peace in our world. Yet despite some of the disturbing facts presented, Douglass leaves us with great hope. As he states, the life and death of John F. Kennedy \"is not so much a story of one man as it is a story of peacemaking when the chips are down. That story is our story, a story of hope**.**\" If each of us is inspired to stand up and do the right thing, the whole world will change for the better.

But, it does require patience and tenacity to confront the unspeakable.** We, first of all, need to take the time to recognize the sources in our history for what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. **'Plausible deniability'** The doctrine of \"plausible deniability\" in an old government document provides us with a source of the assassination of President Kennedy. The document was issued in 1948, one year after the CIA was established, and 15 years before JFK's murder.

[1] **In the 1950s, under the leadership of CIA Director Allen Dulles, the doctrine of \"plausible deniability\" became the CIA's green light to [assassinate national leaders](https://www.WantToKnow.info/johnperkinseconomichitman), conduct secret military operations, and overthrow governments** that our government thought were on the wrong side in the Cold War. \"Plausible deniability\" meant our intelligence agencies, acting as paramilitary groups, had to lie and cover their tracks so effectively that there would be no trace of U.S. government responsibility for criminal activities on an ever-widening scale. **Truman warns about the CIA** **The man who proposed this secret, subversive process in 1948, diplomat [George Kennan](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/18/politics/18kennan.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), said later, in light of its consequences, that it was \"the greatest mistake I ever made.\"** [2] President Harry Truman, under whom the CIA was created, and during whose presidency the plausible deniability doctrine was authorized, had deep regrets. He said in a statement on December 22, 1963: \"We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.\" [3] [Truman later remarked](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040802/2intell_9.htm): \"The CIA was set up by me for the sole purpose of getting all the available information to the president. It was not intended to operate as an international agency engaged in strange activities.\" [4] One assumption behind Kennan's proposal unleashing the CIA for its war against Communism was that the Agency's criminal power could be confined to covert action outside the borders of the United States, with immunity from its lethal power granted to U.S. citizens. That assumption proved to be wrong.**** During the Cold War, the hidden growth of the CIA's autonomous power corresponded to the public growth of what was called a fortress state. A democratic national security state is a contradiction in terms. The insecure basis of our security then became weapons that could destroy the planet. To protect the security of that illusory means of security, which was absolute destructive power, we now needed a ruling elite of national security managers with an authority above that of our elected representatives.

So from that point on, our military-industrial managers made the real decisions of state. President Truman simply ratified their decisions and entrenched their power, as he did with the establishment of the CIA, and as his National Security Council did with its endorsement of plausible deniability. **Kennedy sacks CIA leaders** We know how JFK reacted to the CIA's setting him up. He was furious. **When the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him, he said he wanted \"to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.\"** [5] He ordered an investigation into the whole affair, under the very watchful eyes of his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. He fired CIA Director Allen Dulles, Deputy Director Richard Bissell, Jr., and Deputy Director General Charles Cabell. That was a huge decision - firing the top of the CIA's hierarchy, including the legendary leader who had come to personify the agency, Allen Dulles. The president then took steps \"to cut the CIA budget in 1962 and again in 1963, aiming at a 20 percent reduction by 1966.\" [6] He was cutting back the CIA's power in very concrete ways, step by step. **JFK alienates CIA and Pentagon** **JFK had to confront the unspeakable in the Missile Crisis in the form of total nuclear war. At the height of that terrifying conflict, he felt the situation spiraling out of control, especially because of the actions of his generals. ** The White House tapes show Kennedy questioning and resisting the [mounting pressure to bomb Cuba](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods) coming from both the Joint Chiefs and the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. At the same time, John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, the two men most responsible for the Cuban Missile Crisis, seemed locked in a hopeless ideological conflict. The U.S. and Soviet leaders had been following Cold War policies that now seemed to be moving inexorably toward a war of extermination. **Kennedy and Khrushchev: Two enemies become peacemakers** Yet, as we have since learned, Kennedy and Khrushchev had been engaged in a secret correspondence for over a year that gave signs of hope. Even as they moved publicly step by step toward a Cold War climax that would almost take the world over the edge with them, they were at the same time smuggling confidential letters back and forth that recognized each other's humanity and hoped for a solution. They were public enemies who, in the midst of deepening turmoil, were secretly learning something approaching trust in each other.

They were public enemies who, in the midst of deepening turmoil, were secretly learning something approaching trust in each other. On what seemed the darkest day in the crisis, when a Soviet missile had shot down a U2 spy plane over Cuba, intensifying the already overwhelming pressures on Kennedy to bomb Cuba, the president sent his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, secretly to Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. RFK told Dobrynin, as Dobrynin reported to Khrushchev, that the president \"didn't know how to resolve the situation. The military is putting great pressure on him... Even if he doesn't want or desire a war, something irreversible could occur against his will. That is why the President is asking for help to solve this problem.\" [6] In his memoirs, Khrushchev recalled a further, chilling sentence from Robert Kennedy's appeal to Dobrynin: \"If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.\" [7] **At a moment when the world was falling into darkness, Kennedy did what from his generals' standpoint was intolerable and unforgivable. JFK not only rejected his generals' pressures for war. Even worse, the president then reached out to their enemy, asking for help. That was treason.** When Nikita Khrushchev had received Kennedy's plea for help in Moscow, he turned to his Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and said, \"We have to let Kennedy know that we want to help him.\" Khrushchev stunned himself by what he had just said: Did he really want to help his enemy, Kennedy? Yes, he did. He repeated the word to his foreign minister: \"Yes, help. We now have a common cause, to save the world from those pushing us toward war.\" [8] How do we understand that moment? The two most heavily armed leaders in history, on the verge of total nuclear war, suddenly joined hands against those on both sides pressuring them to attack. Khrushchev ordered the immediate withdrawal of his missiles from Cuba, in return for Kennedy's public pledge never to invade Cuba and his secret promise to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey - as he would in fact do. When President Kennedy stood up to the Pentagon, the CIA, and the military-industrial complex, he was treated as a traitor. His attempt to save the planet from the weapons of his own nation was regarded as treason. The doctrine of \"plausible deniability\" allowed for the assassination of a president seen as a national security risk himself. **Committing heresy for peace** At American University on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories.txt:3:dac58dc603bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8859, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "his secret promise to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey - as he would in fact do.

The doctrine of \"plausible deniability\" allowed for the assassination of a president seen as a national security risk himself. **Committing heresy for peace** At American University on June 10, 1963, President Kennedy proposed an end to the Cold War. Kennedy's rejection of \"a Pax Americana\" was an act of resistance to the military-industrial complex. The military-industrial complex was totally dependent on \"a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.\" [9] That Pax Americana policed by the Pentagon was considered the system's indispensable, hugely profitable means of containing and defeating Communism. At his own risk, Kennedy was rejecting the foundation of the Cold War system. Kennedy said he wanted to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union in Moscow - in their capitol, not ours - as soon as possible. To clear the way for such a treaty, he said he was suspending U.S. atmospheric tests unilaterally. **Kennedy's strategy of peace penetrated the Soviet government's defenses far more effectively than any missile could have done. The Soviet press, which was accustomed to censoring U.S. government statements, published the entire speech all across the country.** Soviet radio stations broadcast and rebroadcast the speech to the Soviet people. In response to Kennedy's turn toward peace, the Soviet government even stopped jamming all Western broadcasts into their country. His speech was received less favorably in his own country. The *New York Times* reported his government's skepticism: \"Generally there was not much optimism in official Washington that the President's conciliation address at American University would produce agreement on a test ban treaty or anything else.\" [10] In contrast to the Soviet media that were electrified by the speech, the U.S. media ignored or downplayed it. For the first time, Americans had less opportunity to read and hear their president's words than did the Russian people. A turn-around was occurring in the world on different levels. Whereas nuclear disarmament had suddenly become feasible, Kennedy's position in his own government had become precarious. **Nuclear test ban treaty** President Kennedy's next critical conflict with his national security state, propelling him toward the coup d'etat he saw as possible, was the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that he signed with Nikita Khrushchev on July 25, 1963, six weeks after the American University Address. **The president had done an end run around the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He negotiated the Test Ban Treaty without consulting them, because they opposed it.** On September 20, Kennedy spoke to the United Nations.

He negotiated the Test Ban Treaty without consulting them, because they opposed it.** On September 20, Kennedy spoke to the United Nations. He suggested that its members see the Test Ban Treaty as a beginning and engage together in an experiment in peace: \"Two years ago I told this body that the United States had proposed, and was willing to sign, a Limited Test Ban treaty. Today that treaty has been signed. It will not put an end to war. It will not remove basic conflicts. It will not secure freedom for all. But it can be a lever, and Archimedes, in explaining the principles of the lever, was said to have declared to his friends: 'Give me a place where I can stand - and I shall move the world.'\" [11] **JFK reaches out to Cuba** In the month leading up to the assassination, Kennedy and Castro actually began a dialogue on normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations, through the mediation of French journalist Jean Daniel who personally visited both men. Daniel was actually eating lunch with Castro in his home on November 22, conveying Kennedy's hopeful words, when the Cuban premier was phoned with the news of Kennedy's death. Castro's somber comment to Daniel was: \"Everything is changed. Everything is going to change.\" [12] **JFK's top-secret order to begin withdrawal from Vietnam** **Kennedy decided on his policy of withdrawal from Vietnam, against the arguments of most of his advisers, at a contentious National Security Council meeting on October 2.** When Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was leaving the meeting to announce the withdrawal to the White House reporters, \"the President called to him, 'And tell them that means all of the helicopter pilots, too.'\" [13] In fact, it would not mean that at all. After JFK's assassination, his withdrawal policy was quietly voided. In light of the future consequences of Dallas, it was not only John Kennedy who was murdered on November 22, 1963, but 58,000 other Americans and over three million Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians. **The Steel Crisis** **In a head-on confrontation with the ruling elite of Big Steel, JFK ordered the Defense Department to switch huge military contracts away from the major steel companies to the smaller, more loyal contractors that had not defied him. After the big steel companies bitterly backed down from their price raises, JFK and his brother, Robert, were denounced as symbols of \"ruthless power\" by the Wall Street power brokers at the center of the military-industrial complex.** In an editorial titled, \"Steel: The Ides of April\" (the month in which Kennedy faced down the steel executives), Henry Luce's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories.txt:5:0cc00a28ded9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8861, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "assassinations__kennedy__john-kennedy-assassination-facts-theories", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "to switch huge military contracts away from the major steel companies to the smaller, more loyal contractors that had not defied him. After the big steel companies bitterly backed down from their price raises, JFK and his brother, Robert, were denounced as symbols of \"ruthless power\" by the Wall Street power brokers at the center of the military-industrial complex.** In an editorial titled, \"Steel: The Ides of April\" (the month in which Kennedy faced down the steel executives), Henry Luce's *Fortune* magazine called to readers' minds the soothsayer's warning in Shakespeare of the assassination of Julius Caesar. *Fortune* was warning Kennedy that his actions had confirmed the worst fears of corporate America about his presidency, and would have dire consequences. As interpreted by the most powerful people in the nation, the steel crisis was a logical prelude to Dallas. It was another Bay of Pigs. **JFK reaches out to third world** Yet another Bay of Pigs was Kennedy's diplomatic opening to the fiery Third-World leadership of President Sukarno of Indonesia. Sukarno was \"the most outspoken proponent of Third World neutralism in the Cold War.\" He had actually coined the term \"Third World.\" The CIA wanted Sukarno dead. It wanted what it saw as his pro-communist \"global orientation\" obliterated. During Eisenhower's presidency, the CIA repeatedly tried to kill and overthrow Sukarno but failed. Most significantly, three days before his assassination, President Kennedy said he was willing to accept Sukarno's invitation to visit Indonesia the following spring. His visit to Indonesia would have dramatized in a very visible way Kennedy's support of Third World nationalism, a sea change in U.S. government policy. JFK's Indonesian policy was also killed in Dallas, with horrendous consequences. After Lyndon Johnson became president, the CIA finally succeeded in overthrowing Sukarno in a massive purge of suspected Communists that ended up killing 500,000 to one million Indonesians. **Kennedy's proposal for a joint U.S.-Soviet moon landing** In his September 20, 1963, speech to the United Nations, JFK once again stated his hope for a joint expedition to the moon. However, neither American nor Soviet military leaders, jealous of their rocket secrets, were ready to accept his initiative. Nikita Khrushchev, siding with his own rocket experts, felt he was still forced to decline Kennedy's proposal. That further visionary step to end the Cold War also died with Kennedy. The United States went to the moon alone. U.S. and Soviet rockets continued to be pointed at their opposite countries rather than being joined in a project for a more hopeful future. Sergei Khrushchev said, \"I think if Kennedy had lived, we would be living in a completely different world.\" **JFK meets the Quakers** In the final weeks of his presidency, President Kennedy took one more risky step toward peace.

Sergei Khrushchev said, \"I think if Kennedy had lived, we would be living in a completely different world.\" **JFK meets the Quakers** In the final weeks of his presidency, President Kennedy took one more risky step toward peace. It can be seen in relation to a meeting he had the year before with six Quakers who visited him in his office. Among their challenges to him was a recommendation that the United States offer its surplus food to the People's Republic of China. China was considered an enemy nation. Yet it was also one whose people were beset by a famine. Kennedy said to the Quakers, \"Do you mean you would feed your enemy when he has his hands on your throat?\" [14] The Quakers said they meant exactly that. They reminded him it was what Jesus had said should be done. Kennedy said he knew that, and knew that it was the right thing to do, but he couldn't overcome the China lobby in Washington to accomplish it. Nevertheless, a year and a half later in the fall of 1963, against overwhelming opposition, Kennedy decided to sell wheat to the Russians, who had a severe grain shortage. His outraged critics said in effect to him what he had said to the Quakers: Would you feed an enemy who has his hands on your throat? **Vice President Lyndon Johnson said he thought Kennedy's decision to sell wheat to Russia would turn out to be the worst political mistake he ever made.** Today JFK's controversial decision \"to feed the enemy\" has been forgotten. In 1963, the wheat sale was seen as a threat to our security - feeding the enemy to kill us. [*For solid evidence Johnson's involvement in the JFK assassination, see the History Channel documentary [available here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/assassinations/men_who_killed_kennedy_9_assassinations).*] The violent reaction to his decision was represented on Friday morning, November 22, 1963, by a threatening, full-page advertisement addressed to him in the *Dallas Morning News*. The ad was bordered in black, like a funeral notice. Among the charges of disloyalty to the nation that the ad made against the president was the question: \"Why have you approved the sale of wheat and corn to our enemies when you know the Communist soldiers 'travel on their stomach' just as ours do?\" **JFK talks about assassination** **JFK read the ad before the flight from Fort Worth to Dallas, pointed it out to Jacqueline Kennedy, and talked about the possibility of his being assassinated that day. \"But, Jackie,\" he said, \"if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?\"** [15] Peacemaking was now at the top of his agenda as president.

That was not the kind of leadership the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the military-industrial complex wanted in the White House. Given the Cold War dogmas that gripped those dominant powers, and given Kennedy's turn toward peace, his assassination followed as a matter of course. So how can the why of his murder give us hope? Where do we find hope when a peacemaking president is assassinated by his own national security state? The why of Kennedy's assassination encircles the earth. Because John Kennedy chose peace on earth at the height of the Cold War, he was executed. But because he turned toward peace, in spite of the consequences to himself, humanity is still alive and struggling. That is hopeful, especially if we understand what he went through and what he has given to us as his vision. **A profile in courage** **The void of the unspeakable is the dark abyss, the midnight reality of plausible deniability, that we face when we peer into our national security state's murder of President Kennedy. And that is precisely where hope begins.** At a certain point in his presidency, John Kennedy turned a corner and didn't look back. I believe that decisive turn toward his final purpose in life, resulting in his death, happened in the darkness of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Although Kennedy was already in conflict with his national security managers, the missile crisis was the breaking point. At that most critical moment for us all, he turned from any remaining control his security managers had over him toward a deeper ethic, a deeper vision in which the fate of the earth became his priority. Without losing sight of our own best hopes in this country, he began to home in, with his new partner, Nikita Khrushchev, on the hope of peace for everyone on this earth. He made that commitment to life at the cost of his own. What a transforming story that is.

It's a subversive story. It shows a different kind of security than always being ready to go to war. **It's unbelievable - or we're supposed to think it is - that a president was murdered by our own government agencies because he was seeking a more stable peace than relying on nuclear weapons. It's unspeakable. ** For the sake of a nation that must always be preparing for war, that story must not be told. If it were, we might learn that peace is possible without making war. We might even learn there is a force more powerful than war. How unthinkable! But how necessary if life on earth is to continue. **That is why it is so hopeful for us to confront the unspeakable and to tell the transforming story of a man of courage, President John F. Kennedy. It is a story ultimately not of death, but of life - all our lives. In the end, it is not so much a story of one man as it is a story of peacemaking when the chips are down. That story is our story, a story of hope.** **Important Note:** To purchase the author's highly acclaimed book *JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters*, [click here](http://www.amazon.com/JFK-Unspeakable-Why-Died-Matters/dp/1439193886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381301134&sr=8-1&keywords=JFK+and+the+Unspeakable%3A+Why+He+Died+and+Why+It+Matters).

Kennedy Assassination ** In his precisely researched, landmark 2010 book *JFK and the Unspeakable*, author James Douglass describes how, horrified by the specter of nuclear annihilation, Kennedy gradually turned away from his long-held Cold Warrior beliefs and toward a policy of lasting peace. But to the military and intelligence agencies in the US, Kennedy's change of heart was a direct threat to their power and influence. These dark \"unspeakable\" elements branded Kennedy as a dangerous traitor, plotted his assassination, and orchestrated the subsequent cover-up. Douglass takes readers into the Oval Office during the tense days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, follows the strange journey of Lee Harvey Oswald and his shadowy handlers, and traverses the winding road in Dallas where an ambush awaited the President's motorcade. As Douglass convincingly documents, at every step along the way these forces of the unspeakable were present, moving people like pawns on a chessboard to promote a dangerous and deadly agenda.

What is most fascinating and rarely discussed isn't his stance on civil rights, but his willingness to speak out about the crimes and atrocities committed by covert elements within the US government. Below, we discuss nefarious efforts by the US military, intelligence, and law enforcement machinery to harass, blackmail, discredit, and spy on Dr. King. We also reveal undeniable evidence connecting these abuses of power to his tragic assassination on April 4, 1968. **Few people know about the 1999 King Family civil trial in Memphis, where it took a jury only one hour to determine that the US government was behind the [assassination of King](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/martin-luther-king-trial-government-guilty). ** In sharing this important and little-known information, we draw upon the powerful words and experience of journalist and human rights lawyer Dr. William Pepper in his book [*The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Plot-to-Kill-King-audiobook/dp/B01MXYQ3VH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FT8A51TJW2TT&keywords=the+plot+to+kill+king&qid=1705276860&s=books&sprefix=the+plot+to+kill+k%2Cstripbooks%2C153&sr=1-1). Pepper was a personal friend to King and the attorney for the King Family. He also represented King's alleged murderer James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan in the trial for the murder of Robert Kennedy. While the information presented here is deeply unsettling, we honor the powerful vision and faith in human goodness that shaped King's activism. Heavily influenced by the nonviolent teachings of Mahatma Gandhi who he saw as a \"guiding light,\" King believed that truth and peace are inseparable. **Truth is rooted in a refusal to do harm with our words and actions, and a personal readiness to suffer for it. **He believed that death and destruction imposed on others, no matter who they are, was an injury to all other human beings. After grieving over photographs of slaughtered Vietnamese children and the destructive use of napalm and white phosphorus on innocent Vietnamese people, he resolved to call passionate attention to harmful US war agendas in every corner of America he visited. *I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway of destruction.

I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor. * ***I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government**. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.* *For those who ask the question, \"Aren't you a civil rights leader?\" and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: **\"To save the soul of America.\"** We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear.* - Dr. King, \"*Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence*,\" 1967 In the last year of his life, Dr. King had plans to move into mainstream politics as a [presidential candidate with pediatrician and anti-war activist Dr. Benjamin Spock](https://www.carolinajournal.com/how-a-nc-professor-almost-built-a-king-spock-presidential-ticket/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Spock%2C%20the%20two%20never,interventionism%20and%20promote%20democratic%20socialism.).

The focus was to bring people together nationwide, highlighting the importance of an anti-poverty and anti-war agenda that would radically shift American society from a \"thing-oriented society\" powered by weapons and machines to a person-oriented society born out of freedom and equality. King dreamed of a global society of peace and cooperation, where the forces and conditions that give rise to war would be eliminated. **He envisioned a movement that would activate a deeper consciousness in activism and politics. **His position on war was a natural extension of the civil rights struggle. As King once said, \"*A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom*.\" The hefty cost of the war required that essential social services and programs in American communities be cut, disproportionately impacting low-income people and communities of color. In addressing freedom and inequality, he began passionately organizing the Poor People's Campaign project, which would involve a tent city of hundreds of thousands of America's most marginalized and underserved communities occupying the Washington Monument. They would remain for as long as it took Congress to take action on restoring social welfare programs. King's actions attracted negative attention from powerful interests. They were threatened by his unifying and empowering message. These interests included politicians, government agents, oil companies, military contractors and multinational banks that all profited lavishly from the war machine and economic inequality. *When one assesses the awesome array of privately established, nongovernmental, institutional power, it is eminently reasonable to consider those in government decision-making positions as being compelled to listen to, protect, and serve the unified interest of this corporate establishment. * **When business speaks with one voice, as it did in respect to the war or the purported extreme threat of war, at the time when Dr. King set himself up in opposition, the relevant government agencies and their officials became mere foot soldiers for the mighty economic interests. ** Out in front during war are the armed forces and the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Not far behind are the executive, the legislative, and the judicial legitimizers, who sanction the necessary action.

Convinced he was a Communist, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had a [particular obsession](https://www.history.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr-fbi-j-edgar-hoover-communism) with taking down King and the larger civil rights movement. Following King's powerful speech \"Beyond Vietnam,\" [168 newspapers attacked him](https://www.npr.org/2010/03/30/125355148/the-story-of-kings-beyond-vietnam-speech).

According to [Senate investigations in 1975](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html), a draft of the letter was found in the files of William Sullivan, who was head of the FBI's domestic intelligence division. **[The letter denounced him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/13/an-old-letter-sheds-light-on-fbis-malice-toward-martin-luther-king-jr/) as a \"a colossal fraud . . . and a dissolute, abnormal moral imbecile ...

This involved [harassment, wiretapping, psychological warfare, propaganda, and calculated assassinations](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ia/cointelpro-fbi) among other techniques.

The National Security Agency (NSA) was [also involved](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-nsa-spied-martin-luther-king-documents-reveal) in spying on King and drawing up \"watch lists\" and wire-tapping phone calls of those opposing the Vietnam War. Even the intelligence branch of the United States Army [spied on King and his family](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html) for three generations. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Center for National Security Studies exposed a little-known CIA division known as the Office of Security (OS), which focused heavily on Dr. King during the 60s and had a strong working relationship with Hoover of the FBI. The OS coordinated a wide range of operations. This included assassination efforts, as illustrated in a [declassified government document](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10213-10101.pdf) revealing OS collaboration with organized crime in attempts to [assassinate Fidel Castro](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--cia-schemes-kill-castro--with-seashell). **[Operation CHAOS and Project RESISTANCE](https://downloads.paperlessarchives.com/p/vc6p/) were covert CIA programs that also engaged in collecting domestic surveillance on protesters, antiwar groups, and individuals challenging official stories.

The [Vietnam] War was a very important monetary issue for major American corporations. **You know; at one point, John Downie, who was head of the military intelligence group, the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, used to brief President Johnson, on a very regular basis. And every time he would come back from Vietnam, he would brief him. And he would ask him: \"Why are we there? Why are we losing blood and treasure? What's behind all of this? What is the reason for it? It doesn't make any sense.\" And Johnson would ignore him for the most part.

The official story of King's murder was that there was no CIA or FBI involvement, and that James Earl Ray was a lone racist gunman. Yet [questions lingered](https://compactmag.com/article/did-the-fbi-kill-mlk), especially when Ray [filed a motion to withdraw his plea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/30/who-killed-martin-luther-king-jr-his-family-believes-james-earl-ray-was-framed/) days after his sentence, claiming he had been framed by his attorney and the FBI. Ray never had a fair trial, and Pepper was convinced of Ray's innocence. He continued to investigate the case even after Ray died. In 1999, Pepper and the King family filed a civil action in Memphis against a man who admitted he was involved: Loyd Jowers, owner of a restaurant near where King was assassinated. Jowers would later admit to being part of the conspiracy to kill King, and he would be found responsible for the killing, along with various government agencies. *The King v. Jowers civil trial ... went on for 30 days with some 70 witnesses. It was not covered by the media. Because of the degree of media control in matters of this sort, very few people know that trial took place.

The day before the murder, Jowers was visited by a man named Raul, who brought a rifle in a box. Betty Spates, a waitress at his grill and girlfriend of Jowers, corroborated his story. In the civil trial, she testified that he had been delivered a large sum of money right before the assassination. **Seconds after the gunshots, she saw him rush into the back of the grill through the back door with the rifle. He then wrapped the weapon in a tablecloth and hid it under the counter. He turned to her and said, \"Betty, you wouldn't do anything to hurt me, would you?\"** Testimonials from countless witnesses including King's driver and *New York Times* reporter Earl Caldwell described seeing the shot come from the bushes and not from the bathroom of the rooming house as the official story states. A witness testified that she heard a fireman announce to the police that \"The shot came from that clump of bushes,\" indicating the heavily overgrown brushy area facing the Lorraine and adjacent to Fire Station 2. **The next morning, Memphis public works employees cut down the bushes and destroyed a \"possible crime scene.\"** Usual special body guards provided by the Memphis police were advised they \"weren't needed\" on the day of the assassination. **Dr. King's room was also changed from a secure 1st-floor room to an exposed balcony room.** Along with sanitizing a crime scene, police abandoned the standard investigative procedure of interviewing witnesses who lived by the scene of the shooting.

And that caught her attention.So, she turned around, looked over;** and then she saw them spit on the body of Dr. King, saw Dr. Bland pull out the catheter, and take a pillow, put the pillow over his face and suffocate him.*** - Excerpt from [an interview with Dr. Pepper](https://archives.kpfa.org/data/20170407-Fri1300.mp3) on [The Project Censored Radio Show](https://www.projectcensored.org/radio/) about the 1999 civil trial **Military Involvement in King's Assassination** **Not only did the civil trial reveal that a Memphis Police officer fired the fatal shot, but two Special Forces military snipers were sent as back-ups if the primary shooter failed.** Pepper eventually tracked down these two Special Forces snipers, who he named as Murphy and Warren. Their cooperation was dependent on remaining anonymous. Warren and Murphy were both active in covert Special Operation Group (SOG) missions in Vietnam. Throughout 1967, they were involved in the highly secretive [902ndMilitary Intelligence Group (MIG) operations](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ArmyFearedKing.html#902), which was run by Colonel John Downie, Lyndon Johnson's former Vietnam briefer. As members of small \"Alpha team\" units for the 902nd MIG, Murphy and Warren were deployed in cities where violence was breaking out. **They were issued photographs and personal information of black radical activists who were designated as targets to be \"taken out\" if a disruption or riot broke out. ** Warren and Murphy would then participate in a Memphis Special Forces training team in civilian disguise, positioned to shoot King on top of the nearby Illinois Central Railroad Building. The two men told Pepper that their commander's \"pep talk\" involved showing pictures of King and Reverend Andrew Young, who was with King in Memphis. **It was stressed to Warren and Murphy that these men were enemies of the US and had plans to bring down the government, which would result in catastrophic results for cities if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:assassinations__king-martin-luther__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination.txt:7:cad41ac71ea7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8880, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "assassinations__king-martin-luther__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "assassinations__king-martin-luther__uncensored-history-of-king-assassination", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "of the US and had plans to bring down the government, which would result in catastrophic results for cities if their plans were executed.** To get more information about the 902nd MIG, Pepper tracked down Steve Tompkins, an investigative reporter who spent 18 months researching the role of army intelligence in surveying and infiltrating black organizations and civil rights groups. ** It was asserted in the [1972 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights](https://books.google.com/books?id=mFtFAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) led by Senator Sam Ervin that [army surveillance in the 60s and 70s was \"massive and unrestrained.](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/senator_sam's_secret_wars)\" Ervin had condemned the military for their regular practice of infiltrating and spying on US activist groups, finding that [their surveillance](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3019&context=ilj&httpsredir=1&referer=) was both \"unauthorized and in violation of the first amendment.\" ** In 1996, Tompkins received a phone call from Colonel Downie, who found Pepper's research on the King assassination in his first book [*Orders to Kill*](https://www.amazon.com/Orders-Kill-Behind-Murder-Martin/dp/1483047415#:~:text=After%20eighteen%20years%20of%20intensive,nation's%20greatest%20civil%20rights%20leader.) \"remarkably accurate,\" yet felt that he gave Downie too much responsibility for the operation. Downie described himself as \"an officer in a chain of command following orders.\" Colonel Downie, refusing to meet with Pepper, agreed to meet with Tompkins. Downie confirmed he played a key role in coordinating the military units in Memphis during the week leading up to and on King's assassination. He also admitted that Ray was one of many people used as \"patsies\" in various covert operations. By the summer of 1997, Colonel Downie had disappeared. *We learned that the 902nd MIG was involved in a clandestine joint venture operation with Carlos Marcello's Mafia family, whereby stolen weapons from US military bases, camps, and arsenals were delivered to Marcello's property, loaded onto barges, and shipped to the Gulf at Houston, where they were off-loaded, repackaged, and sold to right-wing forces in Latin and South America. **The profits were split 50-50 between the 902nd and the mob, with the 902nd using the profits to fund further black operations. This particular operation, the assassination of Dr. King, was ... confirmed by two members of the Alpha 184 sniper team.*** - Excerpt from *Plot to Kill King* **King's Legacy** Many questions remain unanswered about the nature of the money, players, and motives behind the King assassination. His murder raises important questions about the deeper forces undermining meaningful efforts to radically transform society for the greater good. May the information presented here serve as a sobering reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, especially of the very forces within government for whom we put our faith in to uphold America's greatest interests. Despite these stark realities, King remains a powerful moral voice for our times in the wake of the endless US war machine that continues to fuel conflict and destruction worldwide. *Now, what kind of man was he?

A man of enormous courage. No matter how much money it cost him, no matter how much his life became increasingly in danger, he stood firm on behalf of values, that he thought were essential human values. And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in fact, unconscionable. So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy.* - Dr. Pepper In these challenging times, there are many reasons for grief, confusion, and rage. King wrote about these related concerns in his final book *[Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos Or Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F)*. He asserted that humankind has the resources and technology to overcome oppression and corruption. King felt that our best hope for a durable future beyond the harms and abuses of our world must be rooted in the Greek concept of *agape*, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. *Agape* is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all.\" It is the willingness to go to any length to restore community. In *Chaos or Community*, **he calls on the \"creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.\"** As a practitioner in nonviolence, he carried a deep faith in the future. His struggle for justice was accompanied by what he called a cosmic, creative force integrating the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole. May we lead with the courage that King gracefully and fiercely role modeled for us, freeing ourselves from excessive fear and transforming \"us\" vs. \"them\" in thought and action as we work for the well-being of all. ***The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.*** - Dr. King Your financial support makes a difference.

Dear friends, The following is a summary of documentation from the 1999 King Family civil trial in Memphis, in which a jury of six white and six black jurors took only one hour to find the U.S. government guilty for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The lack of coverage of this landmark trial and its astonishing verdict is a prime example of how crucial news is suppressed. **The fact that you don't know about this trial, at which 70 witnesses testified over a period of nearly a month, is proof of a major cover-up by both the media and government. ** For the best concise summary of this eye-opening trial, watch the six-minute video below of a Canadian public television broadcast on the deafening silence around this major event, and then read the facts of the case below. [**www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/martin_luther_king_jr_mlk_assassination_video**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/martin_luther_king_jr_mlk_assassination_video) Here's a list of just some of the overwhelming evidence of government complicity introduced in this trial and validated in the jury's guilty verdict: Usual special body guards provided by the Memphis police were advised they \"weren't needed\" on the day of the assassination. Regular and constant police protection was removed from Dr. King an hour before the assassination. Dr. King's room was changed from a secure 1st-floor room to an exposed balcony room. US 111th Military Intelligence Group were at Dr. King's location during the assassination. The 20th Special Forces Group had an eight-man sniper team at the assassination location on that day. Memphis police ordered the bushes multiple witnesses reported as the source of shooting cut down shortly after the assassination. Along with sanitizing a crime scene, police abandoned the standard investigative procedure of interviewing witnesses who lived by the scene of the shooting. The rifle James Earl Ray delivered was not matched to the bullet that killed Dr. King, and was not sighted to accurately shoot. **The King family believes the government's motivation to assassinate Dr. King was to prevent his imminent effort to camp in and occupy Washington, D.C. until the Vietnam War was ended** and the war's resources were redirected to end poverty and invest in US infrastructure. This is consistent with the belief of many top leaders that war is a racket which is used to line the pockets of the mega-corporations and bankers who support them.

Read [this essay](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption) by one of the most highly decorated generals in U.S. history laying it all out with incredible bluntness. Dr. Martin Luther King's family and personal friend and attorney, [William F. Pepper](http://www.williampepper.com/), was the lawyer representing the King family in this civil trial. The trial, titled [*King Family versus Jowers and Other Unknown Co-Conspirators*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114021258/http://thekingcenter.org/civil-case-king-family-versus-jowers/)*,* is the only trial ever conducted on the assassination of Dr. King. The King Center website [fully documents the entire case](https://web.archive.org/web/20130310012450/http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial) with a [full trial transcript](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/king-martin-luther/king-family-trial-transcript-full.pdf). The U.S. government also denied the King family's requests for independent investigation of the assassination. US corporate media did not cover the trial or interview the King family, and textbooks omit this information. Respected journalist and author [James Douglass](http://ctka.net/pr500-king.html): \"Apart from the courtroom participants, only Memphis TV reporter Wendell Stacy and I attended from beginning to end this historic three-and-one-half week trial. Because of journalistic neglect, scarcely anyone else in this land of ours even knows what went on. After critical testimony was given in the trial's second week before an almost empty gallery, Barbara Reis, U.S. correspondent for the Lisbon daily *Publico* who was there several days, turned to me and said, \"Everything in the U.S. is the trial of the century. O.J. Simpson's trial was the trial of the century. Clinton's trial was the trial of the century. But this *is* the trial of the century, and who's here?\"\" **Though the *New York Times* did include mention of this trial in a [revealing article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-memphis-jury-sees-conspiracy-martin-luther-kings-killing), it was buried inside the paper and never received the front page headlines it deserved.** A CNN report aired in 2008 [raised further questions](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/03/siu.01.html) on King's assassination, but still amazingly little of all of this has been reported.

F. Stone, At the dawn of the nuclear age, an independent Australian journalist named Wilfred Burchett traveled to Japan to cover the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The only problem was that General Douglas MacArthur had declared southern Japan off-limits, barring the press. **Over 200,000 people died in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but no Western journalist witnessed the aftermath and told the story.** The world's media obediently crowded onto the USS Missouri off the coast of Japan to cover the surrender of the Japanese. **Wilfred Burchett decided to strike out on his own.** He was determined to see for himself what this nuclear bomb had done, to understand what this vaunted new weapon was all about. So he boarded a train and traveled for thirty hours to the city of Hiroshima in defiance of General MacArthur's orders. Burchett emerged from the train into a nightmare world. The devastation that confronted him was unlike any he had ever seen during the war. The city of Hiroshima, with a population of 350,000, had been razed. Multistory buildings were reduced to charred posts. He saw people's shadows seared into walls and sidewalks. He met people with their skin melting off.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:atomicbombcoverup.txt:0:bca3b2b2e376", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8887, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "atomicbombcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "atomicbombcoverup", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "he boarded a train and traveled for thirty hours to the city of Hiroshima in defiance of General MacArthur's orders. Burchett emerged from the train into a nightmare world. The devastation that confronted him was unlike any he had ever seen during the war. The city of Hiroshima, with a population of 350,000, had been razed. Multistory buildings were reduced to charred posts. He saw people's shadows seared into walls and sidewalks. He met people with their skin melting off. In the hospital, he saw patients with purple skin hemorrhages, gangrene, fever, and rapid hair loss. Burchett was among the first to witness and and describe radiation sickness. Burchett sat down on a chunk of rubble with his Baby Hermes typewriter. His dispatch began: \"In Hiroshima, thirty days after the first atomic bomb destroyed the city and shook the world, people are still dying, mysteriously and horribly - people who were uninjured in the cataclysm from an unknown something which I can only describe as the atomic plague.\" He continued, tapping out the words that still haunt to this day: **\"Hiroshima does not look like a bombed city. It looks as if a monster steamroller has passed over it and squashed it out of existence. I write these facts as dispassionately as I can in the hope that they will act as a warning to the world.\"** Burchett's article, headlined THE ATOMIC PLAGUE, was published on September 5, 1945, in the London Daily Express. The story caused a worldwide sensation. Burchett's candid reaction to the horror shocked readers. **\"In this first testing ground of the atomic bomb I have seen the most terrible and frightening desolation in four years of war. It makes a blitzed Pacific island seem like an Eden.** The damage is far greater than photographs can show. \"When you arrive in Hiroshima you can look around for twenty-five and perhaps thirty square miles. You can see hardly a building. It gives you an empty feeling in the stomach to see such man-made destruction.\" Burchett's searing independent reportage was a public relations fiasco for the U.S. military.

As Weller later summarized his experience with MacArthur's censors, \"They won.\" **U.S. authorities responded in time-honored fashion to Burchett's revelations: They attacked the messenger.** General MacArthur ordered him expelled from Japan (the order was later rescinded), and his camera with photos of Hiroshima mysteriously vanished while he was in the hospital. U.S. officials accused Burchett of being influenced by Japanese propaganda. They scoffed at the notion of an atomic sickness. The U.S. military issued a press release right after the Hiroshima bombing that downplayed human casualties, instead emphasizing that the bombed area was the site of valuable industrial and military targets. Four days after Burchett's story splashed across front pages around the world, **Major General Leslie R. Groves, director of the atomic bomb project, invited a select group of thirty reporters to New Mexico. Foremost among this group was William L. Laurence, the Pulitzer Prize-winning science reporter for The New York Times.** Groves took the reporters to the site of the first atomic test. His intent was to demonstrate that no atomic radiation lingered at the site. Groves trusted Laurence to convey the military's line; the general was not disappointed. **Laurence's front-page story, U.S. ATOM BOMB SITE BELIES TOKYO TALES: TESTS ON NEW MEXICO RANGE CONFIRM THAT BLAST, AND NOT RADIATION, TOOK TOLL,** ran on September 12, 1945, following a three-day delay to clear military censors. \"This historic ground in New Mexico, scene of the first atomic explosion on earth and cradle of a new era in civilization, gave the most effective answer today to Japanese propaganda that radiations [sic] were responsible for deaths even after the day of the explosion, Aug. 6, and that persons entering Hiroshima had contracted mysterious maladies due to persistent radioactivity,\" the article began. Laurence said unapologetically that the Army tour was intended \"to give the lie to these claims.\" **Laurence quoted General Groves: \"The Japanese claim that people died from radiation. If this is true, the number was very small.\"** Laurence then went on to offer his own remarkable editorial on what happened: \"The Japanese are still continuing their propaganda aimed at creating the impression that we won the war unfairly, and thus attempting to create sympathy for themselves and milder terms. Thus, at the beginning, the Japanese described 'symptoms' that did not ring true.\" **But Laurence knew better. He had observed the first atomic bomb test on July 16, 1945, and he withheld what he knew about radioactive fallout across the southwestern desert that poisoned local residents and livestock.

He kept mum about the spiking Geiger counters all around the test site.** **William L. Laurence went on to write a series of ten articles for the Times that served as a glowing tribute to the ingenuity and technical achievements of the nuclear program. Throughout these and other reports, he downplayed and denied the human impact of the bombing. Laurence won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting.** **It turns out that William L. Laurence was not only receiving a salary from The New York Times. He was also on the payroll of the War Department.** In March 1945, General Leslie Groves had held a secret meeting at The New York Times with Laurence to offer him a job writing press releases for the Manhattan Project, the U.S. program to develop atomic weapons. The intent, according to the Times, was \"to explain the intricacies of the atomic bomb's operating principles in laymen's language.\" Laurence also helped write statements on the bomb for President Truman and Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Laurence eagerly accepted the offer, \"his scientific curiosity and patriotic zeal perhaps blinding him to the notion that he was at the same time compromising his journalistic independence,\" as essayist Harold Evans wrote in a history of war reporting. Evans recounted: \"After the bombing, the brilliant but bullying Groves continually suppressed or distorted the effects of radiation. He dismissed reports of Japanese deaths as 'hoax or propaganda.' The Times' Laurence weighed in, too, after Burchett's reports, and parroted the government line.\" Indeed, numerous press releases issued by the military after the Hiroshima bombing - which in the absence of eyewitness accounts were often reproduced verbatim by U.S. newspapers - were written by none other than Laurence. \"Mine has been the honor, unique in the history of journalism, of preparing the War Department's official press release for worldwide distribution,\" boasted Laurence in his memoirs, Dawn Over Zero. \"No greater honor could have come to any newspaperman, or anyone else for that matter.\" **\"Atomic Bill\" Laurence revered atomic weapons. He had been crusading for an American nuclear program in articles as far back as 1929. His dual status as government agent and reporter earned him an unprecedented level of access** to American military officials - he even flew in the squadron of planes that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. His reports on the atomic bomb and its use had a hagiographic tone, laced with descriptions that conveyed almost religious awe.

His reports on the atomic bomb and its use had a hagiographic tone, laced with descriptions that conveyed almost religious awe. In Laurence's article about the bombing of Nagasaki (it was withheld by military censors until a month after the bombing), he described the detonation over Nagasaki that incinerated 100,000 people. Laurence waxed: \"Awe-struck, we watched it shoot upward like a meteor coming from the earth instead of from outer space, becoming ever more alive as it climbed skyward through the white clouds. It was a living thing, a new species of being, born right before our incredulous eyes.\" Laurence later recounted his impressions of the atomic bomb: \"Being close to it and watching it as it was being fashioned into a living thing, so exquisitely shaped that any sculptor would be proud to have created it, one . . . felt oneself in the presence of the supranatural.\" Laurence was good at keeping his master's secrets - from suppressing the reports of deadly radioactivity in New Mexico to denying them in Japan. The Times was also good at keeping secrets, only revealing Laurence's dual status as government spokesman and reporter on August 7, the day after the Hiroshima bombing - and four months after Laurence began working for the Pentagon. As Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell wrote in their excellent book Hiroshima in America: Fifty Years of Denial, **\"Here was the nation's leading science reporter, severely compromised, not only unable but disinclined to reveal all he knew about the potential hazards of the most important scientific discovery of his time.\"** **Radiation: Now You See It, Now You Don't** A curious twist to this story concerns **another New York Times journalist** who reported on Hiroshima; his name, believe it or not, **was William Lawrence (his byline was W.H. Lawrence). He has long been confused with William L. Laurence.** (Even Wilfred Burchett confuses the two men in his memoirs and his 1983 book, Shadows of Hiroshima.) Unlike the War Department's Pulitzer Prize winner, **W.H. Lawrence visited and reported on Hiroshima on the same day as Burchett.** (William L. Laurence, after flying in the squadron of planes that bombed Nagasaki, was subsequently called back to the United States by the Times and did not visit the bombed cities.) W.H. Lawrence's original dispatch from Hiroshima was published on September 5, 1945. He reported matter-of-factly about the deadly effects of radiation, and wrote that Japanese doctors worried that \"all who had been in Hiroshima that day would die as a result of the bomb's lingering effects.\" **He described", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:atomicbombcoverup.txt:4:9564a6ad44e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8891, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "atomicbombcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "atomicbombcoverup", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Burchett.** (William L.

He reported matter-of-factly about the deadly effects of radiation, and wrote that Japanese doctors worried that \"all who had been in Hiroshima that day would die as a result of the bomb's lingering effects.\" **He described how \"persons who had been only slightly injured on the day of the blast lost 86 percent of their white blood corpuscles, developed temperatures of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, their hair began to drop out, they lost their appetites, vomited blood and finally died.\"** **Oddly enough, W.H. Lawrence contradicted himself one week later in an article headlined NO RADIOACTIVITY IN HIROSHIMA RUIN.** For this article, the Pentagon's spin machine had swung into high gear in response to Burchett's horrifying account of \"atomic plague.\" W.H. Lawrence reported that Brigadier General T. F. Farrell, chief of the War Department's atomic bomb mission to Hiroshima, \"denied categorically that [the bomb] produced a dangerous, lingering radioactivity.\" Lawrence's dispatch quotes only Farrell; the reporter never mentions his eyewitness account of people dying from radiation sickness that he wrote the previous week. The conflicting accounts of Wilfred Burchett and William L. Laurence might be ancient history were it not for a modern twist. On October 23, 2003, The New York Times published an article about a controversy over a Pulitzer Prize awarded in 1932 to Times reporter Walter Duranty. A former correspondent in the Soviet Union, Duranty had denied the existence of a famine that had killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932 and 1933. The Pulitzer Board had launched two inquiries to consider stripping Duranty of his prize. The Times \"regretted the lapses\" of its reporter and had published a signed editorial saying that Duranty's work was \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Current Times executive editor Bill Keller decried Duranty's \"credulous, uncritical parroting of propaganda.\" On November 21, 2003, the Pulitzer Board decided against rescinding Duranty's award, concluding that there was \"no clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception\" in the articles that won the prize. As an apologist for Joseph Stalin, Duranty is easy pickings. **What about the \"deliberate deception\" of William L. Laurence in denying the lethal effects of radioactivity? And what of the fact that the Pulitzer Board knowingly awarded the top journalism prize to the Pentagon's paid publicist, who denied the suffering of millions of Japanese?** Do the Pulitzer Board and the Times approve of \"uncritical parroting \" - as long as it is from the United States? **It is long overdue that the prize for Hiroshima's apologist be stripped.** The original of the above article published on Aug. 10, 2004 is [available here](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2004/08/10/hiroshima-cover-how-war-departments-timesman-won-pulitzer). *Amy Goodman is host", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:atomicbombcoverup.txt:5:99e57316c61d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8892, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "atomicbombcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "atomicbombcoverup", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "And what of the fact that the Pulitzer Board knowingly awarded the top journalism prize to the Pentagon's paid publicist, who denied the suffering of millions of Japanese?** Do the Pulitzer Board and the Times approve of \"uncritical parroting \" - as long as it is from the United States? **It is long overdue that the prize for Hiroshima's apologist be stripped.** The original of the above article published on Aug. 10, 2004 is [available here](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2004/08/10/hiroshima-cover-how-war-departments-timesman-won-pulitzer). *Amy Goodman is host of the national radio and TV show \"Democracy Now!.\" This is an excerpt from her new national bestselling book [The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media that Love Them](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401301312/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/?tag=wanttinfo-20), written with her brother journalist David, exposes the reporting of Times correspondent William L.

Unlike influenza viruses that are passed easily between people, H5N1 has a hard time attaching to cells in the nose, throat and upper airways. But it readily attaches to cells deep in the lungs. This suggests that **people need close and heavy exposure to the H5N1 virus for it to get into the lungs.** **Note:** Yet governments have already spent many millions of dollars stockpiling Tamiflu believing that avian flu will mutate and cause a pandemic killing millions. And top government officials have already made many millions of dollars on stocks related to Tamiflu--the drug designed to combat a deadly virus which hasn't even mutated yet to know if the drug works!

Dr Nguyen Tuong Van runs the intensive care unit at the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi and has treated 41 victims of H5N1. **Van followed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and gave her patients Tamiflu, but concluded it had no effect.** \"We place no importance on using this drug on our patients,\" she said. \"Tamiflu is really only meant for treating ordinary type A flu.

Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, a molecular pathologist at the Armed Forces Institute of Technology [said that] the 1918 virus appears to be a bird flu virus. But if it is from a bird, it is not a bird anyone has studied before. It is not like the A(H5N1) strain of bird flus in Asia, which has sickened at least 116 people, and killed 60. It is not like the influenza viruses that infect fowl in North America.

In the past six months fears of a pandemic and the ensuing scramble for Tamiflu have sent Gilead's stock from $35 to $47. That's made the Pentagon chief, already one of the wealthiest members of the Bush cabinet, at least $1 million richer. Rumsfeld isn't the only political heavyweight benefiting from demand for Tamiflu.

Under the National Response Plan, which also plans for actions in case of pandemics, DHS assumes top authority when an \"incident of national significance\" is declared. The first such \"incident of national significance\" was declared in August after Hurricane Katrina hit; however, federal coordination among agencies and state and local governments broke down on so many levels that even President Bush was forced to acknowledge that the plan was flawed. Federal officials have been role playing different flu outbreak scenarios for the past several months. **Last year's plan called for closing of schools, restricting travel and...lock-down quarantine measures.** Those extreme measures jumped into the spotlight...when President Bush suggested that federal military troops - not just the National Guard - may have to be called in to enforce a quarantine. **Note:** Isn't it interesting how the government seems to be predicting that the avian flu, which has killed [less than 100 people worldwide](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101102131.html), is going to mutate and cause massive deaths?

The president raised the same idea after Hurricane Katrina, suggesting that he is considering a greater role for the military in natural disasters. Most public health experts believe it is impossible to entirely isolate neighborhoods, towns, cities or regions during an outbreak of disease. Instead, quarantines today generally refer to a variety of strategies for identifying and limiting the movement of people who are infected with a contagious pathogen or are at high risk. That might include screening travelers for fever and flu symptoms; prohibiting large gatherings of people, including at some workplaces; and requiring that people exposed to infected individuals stay at home until the incubation period for the illness has passed. China took these measures during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. **Bush wants right to use military if bird flu hits October 4, 2005, ABC/Reuters ** [http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1183192](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1183192) President George W.

And how do you, then, enforce a quarantine?\"** Bush asked at a news conference.

It is made more difficult by the fact that we exist in a society where institutions and individuals of power speak in coded language, using deceptive rhetoric with abstract meaning. This report is to serve as a reference point for future discussion and analysis of 'geopolitics' and foreign policy issues. As an introduction to the institutions and individuals of empire, it can provide a framework for people to interpret foreign policy differently, to question those quoted and interviewed in the media as 'experts,' to integrate their understanding of think tanks into contemporary politics and society, and to bring to the surface the names, organizations and ideas of society's ruling class. Think tanks bring together prominent academics, former top government officials, corporate executives, bankers, media representatives, foundation officials and other elites in an effort to establish consensus on issues of policy and strategy. They produce reports and recommendations for policy-makers, functioning as recruitment centers for those who are selected to key government positions where they have the ability to implement policies. **Thus, think tanks function as the intellectual engines of empire: they establish consensus among elites, provide policy prescriptions, strategic recommendations, and the personnel required to implement imperial policies through government", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__engineering-empire.txt:0:7da1940fedec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8902, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__engineering-empire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__engineering-empire", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "corporate executives, bankers, media representatives, foundation officials and other elites in an effort to establish consensus on issues of policy and strategy.

These institutions tend to rely upon funding from major foundations (such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, etc.) as well as corporations and financial institutions, and even various government agencies. There is an extensive crossover in leadership and membership between these institutions. **Meet the Engineers of Empire** **Within the U.S. government, the National Security Council (NSC) functions as the main planning group, devising strategy and policies for the operation of American power in the world.** The NSC coordinates multiple other government agencies, bringing together the secretaries of the State and Defense Departments, the CIA, NSA, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and various other government bodies, with meetings directed by the National Security Adviser, who is generally one of the president's most trusted and influential advisers. In several administrations, the National Security Adviser became the most influential voice and policy-maker to do with foreign policy, such as during the Nixon administration (Henry Kissinger) and the Carter administration (Zbigniew Brzezinski). Roughly focusing on the period from the early 1970s until today, what emerges from this research is a highly integrated network of foreign policy elites. Individuals like Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft, and Joseph Nye figure prominently in sitting at the center of the American imperial establishment over the course of decades, with powerful corporate and financial patrons such as the Rockefeller family existing in the background of American power structures. While both Kissinger and Brzezinski were top government officials in the 1970s, their influence has not declined in the decades since they held such positions. In fact, it could be argued that both of their influence has increased with their time outside of government. David Rothkopf has written the official history of the National Security Council (NSC) in his book,* Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power*. In this 2005 book, Rothkopf noted that, \"[e]very single national security advisor since Kissinger is, in fact, within two degrees of Kissinger,\" referring to the fact that they have all \"worked with him as aides, on his staff, or directly with him in some capacity,\" or worked for someone in those", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__engineering-empire.txt:1:208e7394174b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8903, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__engineering-empire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__engineering-empire", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the official history of the National Security Council (NSC) in his book,* Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power*.

[1] In a 1980 survey of a sample of officials in the State Department, CIA, Department of Defense and the National Security Council (the four government agencies primarily tasked with managing foreign policy), Henry Kissinger was listed as the most influential to the thinking of those who took the survey, followed by Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Stanley Hoffmann.\" [2] **Arguably, both Kissinger and Brzezinski are two of the most influential individuals within the foreign policy elite networks. Certainly of no detriment to their careers was the fact that both cultivated close working and personal relationships with what can be said to be America's most powerful dynasty, the Rockefeller family.** The Rockefeller family - largely acting through various family foundations - were also pivotal in the founding and funding of several prominent think tanks, notably the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, Trilateral Commission [[founded by Brzezinski and David Rockefeller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission#Founding)], the [Group of Thirty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_30), and the Bilderberg Group, among many others. The power of a corporate-financial dynasty like that of the Rockefellers is not a given: it must be maintained, nurtured, and strengthened, otherwise it will be overcome or made obsolete. **Today's main dynasties are born of corporate or banking power, maintained through family lines and extended through family ties to individuals, institutions, and policy-makers. The Rockefellers are arguably the most influential dynasty in the United States, but comparable to [the Rothschilds](https://www.WantToKnow.info/rothschilds-familynewsarticles) in France and the UK, [the Wallenbergs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallenberg_family) in Sweden, [the Agnellis](http://www.italia-online.co.uk/article.php/The_Agnellis) in Italy, or [the Desmarais family](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/business/26fund.html) in Canada. These families are themselves connected through institutions such as the [Bilderberg Group](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060623bilderbergersgroup) and the Trilateral Commission, among others**. **Strategies For Empire ** The American imperial community of intellectuals and think tanks has long been engaged in a process of outlining a geostrategic vision for America's domination of the world. In decades past, the Cold War provided the cover for the American extension of hegemony around the world under the premise of 'containing' the Soviet Union and the spread of 'Communism.' Yet all the talk of protecting the world from communism and the Soviet Union was little more than rhetorical deception to justify American hegemony. **Zbigniew Brzezinski was quite blunt in his assessment of the Cold War: \"The policy of liberation was a strategic sham, designed to a significant degree for domestic political reasons. The policy was basically rhetorical, at most tactical.\" [3] **In other words,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__engineering-empire.txt:2:c4108ec4272b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8904, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__engineering-empire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__engineering-empire", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the world under the premise of 'containing' the Soviet Union and the spread of 'Communism.'

The policy was basically rhetorical, at most tactical.\" [3] **In other words, it was a lie, carefully constructed to deceive the American population into accepting the actions of a powerful state in its attempts to dominate the world. With the end of the Cold War came the end of the 'containment' policy of foreign policy. It was then the task of 'experts' and 'policy-oriented intellectuals' to assess the present circumstances of American power in the world and to construct new strategic concepts for the extension and preservation of that power. Reagan's U.S. National Security Council-Defense Department Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy issued a report, *Discriminate Deterrence*, in 1988 which noted that over the following decade, \"the United States will need to be better prepared to deal with conflicts in the Third World\" which would \"require new kinds of planning.\" [4] In 1992, the *New York Times* leaked a classified document compiled by top Pentagon officials (including Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney) devising a strategy for America in the post-Cold War world. **As the [*Times*summarized](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/world/us-strategy-plan-calls-for-insuring-no-rivals-develop.html?pagewanted=all), the Defense Policy Guidance document \"asserts that America's political and military mission in the post-cold-war era will be to ensure that no rival superpower is allowed to emerge in Western Europe, Asia or the territories of the former Soviet Union.\" ** The document \"makes the case for a world dominated by one superpower whose position can be perpetuated by constructive behavior and sufficient military might to deter any nation or group of nations from challenging American primacy.\" [5] In 1997, Brzezinski published a book outlining his strategic vision for America's role in the world, entitled [*The Grand Chessboard*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brzezinskigrandchessboard). In it, he wrote: \"To put it in a terminology that hearkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.\" [6] The 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy announced by the Bush administration, thereafter referred to as the \"Bush doctrine,\" included the usual rhetoric about democracy and freedom, and then established the principle of \"preemptive war\" and unilateral intervention for America's War of Terror: \"In an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather.\" [7] The doctrine announced that the U.S. \"will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__engineering-empire.txt:3:3ab74fe48515", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8905, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__engineering-empire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__engineering-empire", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "announced by the Bush administration, thereafter referred to as the \"Bush doctrine,\" included the usual rhetoric about democracy and freedom, and then established the principle of \"preemptive war\" and unilateral intervention for America's War of Terror: \"In an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather.\" [7] The doctrine announced that the U.S. \"will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, [but] we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively against terrorists.\" [8] **CSIS: The 'Brain' of the Obama Administration ** While serving as national security advisor, Thomas Donilon spoke at the prestigious think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies ([CSIS](http://csis.org/)) in November of 2012. He began his speech by stating that for roughly half a century, CSIS has been \"the intellectual capital that has informed so many of our national security policies, including during the Obama administration. We've shared ideas and we've shared staff.\" [9] Indeed, CSIS has been an exceptionally influential presence within the Obama administration. CSIS launched a Commission on 'Smart Power' in 2006, co-chaired by Joseph S. Nye, Jr. and Richard Armitage, with the final report delivered in 2008, designed to influence the next president of the United States on implementing \"a smart power strategy.\" **Joseph Nye is known for - among other things - developing the concept of what he calls \"soft power\" to describe gaining support through \"attraction\" rather than force.** In the lead-up to the 2008 presidential elections, Nye stated that if Obama became president, it \"would do more for America's soft power around the world than anything else we could do.\" [10] In the Commission's final report, \"A Smarter, More Secure America,\" the term 'smart power' was defined as \"complementing U.S. military and economic might with greater investments in soft power.\" The report recommended that the United States \"reinvigorate the alliances, partnerships, and institutions that serve our interests,\" as well as increasing the role of \"development in U.S. foreign policy\" which would allow the United States to \"align its own interests with the aspirations of people around the world.\" Another major area of concern was that of \"[b]ringing foreign populations to our side,\" which depended upon \"building long-term, people-to-people relationships, particularly among youth.\" Further, the report noted that \"the benefits of free trade must be expanded,\" and that it was America's responsibility to \"establish global consensus and develop innovative solutions\" for issues such as energy security and climate change. [11] In their summary of the report, Nye and Armitage wrote that** the ultimate \"goal of U.S. foreign policy should be to prolong and preserve American preeminence as an agent for good.\" The goal, of course, was to 'prolong and preserve American preeminence,' whereas the notion of being 'an agent for good' was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__engineering-empire.txt:4:ae4402669e52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8906, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__engineering-empire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__engineering-empire", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "trade must be expanded,\" and that it was America's responsibility to \"establish global consensus and develop innovative solutions\" for issues such as energy security and climate change.

Nye and Armitage suggested that the U.S. \"should have higher ambitions than being popular,\" though acknowledging, \"foreign opinion matters to U.S. decision-making,\" so long as it aligns with U.S. decisions, presumably. A \"good reputation,\" they suggested, \"brings acceptance for unpopular ventures.\" **This was not to mark a turn away from using military force, as was explicitly acknowledged: \"We will always have our enemies, and we cannot abandon our coercive tools.\" Using \"soft power,\" however, was simply to add to America's arsenal of military and economic imperialism: \"bolstering soft power makes America stronger.\"** [12] **Taking Responsibility ** Empires don't just happen; they are constructed. They can also be deconstructed and dismantled, but that doesn't just happen either. Opposing empire is not a passive act: it requires dedication and information, action and reaction. As relatively privileged individuals in western state-capitalist societies, we have both the opportunity and the responsibility to understand and oppose what our governments do abroad, how they treat the people of the world, how they engage with the world. **It is our responsibility to do something, precisely because we have the opportunity to do so, unlike the majority of the world's population who live in abject poverty, under ruthless dictators that we arm and maintain in countries we bomb and regions we dominate. We exist in the epicenter of empire, and thus: we are the only ones capable of ending empire. ** **Note:** To read the full, fascinating report (20 pages) which clearly shows the inordinate power of a small number of individuals, families, and groups in our world, [click here](http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/engineeringempire.html).

The entire article is copied below. To give an idea of how much money that is, if you divide the entire US population of around 325 million into $21 trillion, **the amount missing is equivalent to $65,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. ** CBS News in 2002 was the [first to report](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-2.3-trilliions-missing-pentagon-military-war-waste) on the much smaller amount of $2.3 trillion missing from the Pentagon, as acknowledged by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in a report on the Dept. of Defense website. Rumsfeld's report was later strangely removed from the website, but is still [available on the Internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100601180131/http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430). No other media picked up on this mind-blowing news. What should have been a top headline-grabbing story of highest concern to all Americans was simply dropped. Since then, a few major media have published isolated articles on missing trillions, as summarized on [this revealing webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary), yet again, these stories were not given the top headlines they deserved. They thus attracted little notice and were dropped, so the public remained uniformed of this concerning news. **Catherine Austin Fitts, a courageous former Assistant Secretary of HUD (Housing and Urban Development) under George H. W. Bush, couldn't believe this vitally important story was being ignored by the media.** An incredibly sharp economist who once served as managing director of the Wall Street investment bank Dillon, Read & Co, Fitts researched further and has been releasing reports over the years on the many trillions missing on her highly informative and inspiring website [solari.com](http://solari.com/). The media has conspicuously avoided her detailed work on this. **Michigan State professor of economics [Mark Skidmore](http://www.econ.msu.edu/faculty/skidmore/) discovered the excellent work of Fitts several years ago.** He couldn't believe Fitts claim that $6.5 trillion were missing from the US government. Thinking she had mistakenly written trillions instead of billions, he and his graduate students sifted through thousands of US government reports and were astounded to find not only that Fitts was right, but that the amount was even greater that Fitts had thought. **Skidmore eventually worked together with economics professor [Laurence Kotlikoff](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/) of Boston University, a regular *Forbes* magazine contributor, to compose the below article blowing the lid off this huge cover-up of $21 trillion gone missing from government coffers.** Note that once certain government officials saw Skidmore exposing this, they removed many of the incriminating", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__missing-trillions.txt:0:70490c122c4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8910, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__missing-trillions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__missing-trillions", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "thousands of US government reports and were astounded to find not only that Fitts was right, but that the amount was even greater that Fitts had thought. **Skidmore eventually worked together with economics professor [Laurence Kotlikoff](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/) of Boston University, a regular *Forbes* magazine contributor, to compose the below article blowing the lid off this huge cover-up of $21 trillion gone missing from government coffers.** Note that once certain government officials saw Skidmore exposing this, they removed many of the incriminating documents from their websites.

The report indicates that **for fiscal year 2015 the Army failed to provide adequate support for $6.5 trillion in journal voucher adjustments. ** [According to the GAO's Comptroller General](http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fiar/FIAR_Plan_May_2015.pdf), \"Journal vouchers are summary-level accounting adjustments made when balances between systems cannot be reconciled. Often these journal vouchers are unsupported, meaning they lack supporting documentation to justify the adjustment or are not tied to specific accounting transactions.... For an auditor,** journal vouchers are a red flag for transactions not being captured, reported, or summarized correctly.\"** (Note, after Mark Skidmore began inquiring about OIG-reported unsubstantiated adjustments, the OIG's webpage, which documented, albeit in a highly incomplete manner, **these unsupported \"accounting adjustments,\" was mysteriously taken down. Fortunately, Mark copied the July 2016 report and all other relevant OIG-reports in advance and [reposted them here](https://missingmoney.solari.com/dod-and-hud-missing-money-supporting-documentation/). **Mark has repeatedly tried to contact Lorin Venable, Assistant Inspector General at the Office of the Inspector General.

Fortunately, Mark copied the July 2016 report and all other relevant OIG-reports in advance and [reposted them here](https://missingmoney.solari.com/dod-and-hud-missing-money-supporting-documentation/). **Mark has repeatedly tried to contact Lorin Venable, Assistant Inspector General at the Office of the Inspector General. He has emailed, phoned, and used LinkedIn to ask Ms. Venable about OIG's disclosure of unsubstantiated adjustments, but she has not responded.) **Given that the entire Army budget in fiscal year 2015 was $120 billion, unsupported adjustments were 54 times the level of spending authorized by Congress.** The July 2016 report indicates that unsupported adjustments are the result of the Defense Department's \"failure to correct system deficiencies.\" The result, according to the report, is that data used to prepare the year-end financial statements were unreliable and lacked an adequate audit trail. **The report indicates that just 170 transactions accounted for $2.1 trillion in year-end unsupported adjustments. No information is given about these 170 transactions.** In addition many thousands of transactions with unsubstantiated adjustments were, according to the report, removed by the Army. There is no explanation concerning why they were removed nor their magnitude. The July 2016 report states, \"In addition, DFAS (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) Indianapolis personnel did not document or support why DDRS (The Defense Department Reporting System) removed at least 16,513 of 1.3 million feeder file records during the Third Quarter.\" An appendix to the July 2016 report shows $2 trillion in changes to the Army General Fund balance sheet due to unsupported adjustments. On the asset side, there is $794 billion increase in the Army's Fund Balance with the U.S. Treasury. There is also an increase of $929 billion in the Army's Accounts Payable. **This information raises additional major questions.** First, what is the source of the additional $794 billion in the Army's Fund Balance? This adjustment represents more than six times appropriated spending. Second, do these transfers represent a flow of funds to the Army beyond those authorized by Congress? Third, were these funds authorized and if so when and by whom? Fourth, what is the source of these funds? Finally, the $929 billion in Accounts Payable appears to represent an amount owed for items or services purchased on credit. What entities have received or will receive payment? The July 2016 report is not the only such report of unsubstantiated adjustments. Mark Skidmore and Catherine Austin Fitts, former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, conducted a search of government websites and found similar reports dating back to 1998. **While the documents are incomplete, original government sources indicate $21 trillion in unsupported adjustments have been reported for the Department of Defense and the Department of Housing and Urban", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:b__missing-trillions.txt:2:d6fd5841a753", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8912, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "b__missing-trillions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "b__missing-trillions", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "on credit.

The ongoing occurrence and gargantuan nature of unsupported, i.e., undocumented, U.S. federal government expenditures as well as sources of funding for these expenditures should be a great concern to all tax payers. **Taken together these reports point to a failure to comply with basic Constitutional and legislative requirements for spending and disclosure. We urge the House and Senate Budget Committee to initiate immediate investigations of unaccounted federal expenditures as well as the source of their payment.** **Note:** The above article is copied from the *Forbes* magazine website on [this webpage.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2017/12/08/has-our-government-spent-21-trillion-of-our-money-without-telling-us/) Watch Prof. Skidmore discussing this astounding news in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CwpjIwwI9o&t=680s).

With best wishes, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) **Global Financial Reform** **The New Financiers** By Hazel Henderson A venture capitalist friend of mine asked me in a recent discussion about the financial meltdown, \"who will be the new financiers?\" I answered immediately, \"the new financiers will be the high-level information and knowledge brokers - and they will aggregate the new research on global change processes and lead in structuring the deals now creating the growing green economy.\" Today information and media drive markets. These new financiers are already operating unseen by traditional Wall Streeters and asset managers. They are largely invisible to current financial players and governments because information is their prime currency; rather than money. The new deal-makers value the role of honest, well-managed currencies that remain dependable stores of value and mediums of exchange. Money is a special kind of information, not a commodity in itself, but rather a brilliant invention of the human mind. **When backed by real-world goods and service, as well as strong contracts, money can accurately track and score human ingenuity, productivity and transactions interacting with the natural wealth of resources of our home: Planet Earth.** The problem with money is keeping it honest and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global.txt:0:ea671165ddfe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8915, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "role of honest, well-managed currencies that remain dependable stores of value and mediums of exchange. Money is a special kind of information, not a commodity in itself, but rather a brilliant invention of the human mind. **When backed by real-world goods and service, as well as strong contracts, money can accurately track and score human ingenuity, productivity and transactions interacting with the natural wealth of resources of our home: Planet Earth.** The problem with money is keeping it honest and keeping its \"promise to pay\" firm. From the goldsmiths who over-lent against their piles of gold held in storage for their customers, to the kings who shaved of the edges of coins and today's bankers who create our money out of thin air, we humans have found many ways to debase our currencies. Human activities grew from traditional barter, mutual aid and gifting to the invention of money back around 3,000 BC. Our money evolved from clay tablets, shells and cows to metal tokens, gold, silver, today's paper money and electronic currencies that are blips on millions of financial trading screens. As we expanded worldwide with the advent of the Industrial Revolution in Europe 300 years ago, our need to trade and exchange grew exponentially. This required expanding our money systems of exchange. Gold, which backed most currencies in growing international trade, became too constricting - there just wasn't enough of if. Many traders turned to silver and other precious metals. Soon, the lack of gold led governments to issue paper \"fiat\" currencies backed only by promises and a fraction of actual gold. Some countries shut their \"gold windows,\" including the USA in 1971, and restricted their citizens from owning gold. Our current financial crises go beyond those earlier contractions, panics and recessions caused by the lack of gold or sufficient supplies of credible paper money. Central bankers have learned the lessons of the Great Depression. **The money supply must keep up with, not surpass, the expansion of production and trading as a country grows and its real economy progresses. Today, the interlinking of all countries' economies due to the globalization of finance and technology caused money-creation to go wild, leading to a credit bubble and mountains of debt.** Computerization of finance and markets speeded up trading to seconds; satellite inter-linkage of round-the-clock stock and commodity exchanges led to the explosion of derivatives contracts, ever more exotic \"securitization\" of packages of mortgages, student loans and credit card debts. Risk-analysis was relegated to ivory-tower mathematicians' algorithms which ignored real-world conditions. All this multiplied the creation of money and credit exponentially. **Reckless, poorly regulated financial firms on Wall Street sold their dubious, toxic \"securities\" to gullible investors and pension funds (which should have known better) around the world. For example, the bets on who might default, called credit default swaps, grew unregulated to now comprise $683 trillion of contracts (Bank for International", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global.txt:1:4aa6ff32308d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8916, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__080314_financial_reform_global", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of mortgages, student loans and credit card debts.

For example, the bets on who might default, called credit default swaps, grew unregulated to now comprise $683 trillion of contracts (Bank for International Settlements December 2008) - while real global production measures only the $62 trillion of global GDP (IMF October 2008).** **The resulting crises were predicted by me and others over the past decades. All that money and debt creation led to illusory gains and today's inevitable losses and \"de-leveraging.\" ** The bubble in finance and money itself has popped. Central bankers and financiers, schooled in the world's leading business schools and economics departments focus on money and global monetary circuitry. They were rarely taught that money was simply one form of information - now deeply devalued as all the new forms of money-creation went wild. **Today, we see central bankers printing money on TV. No amount of ink and paper can print enough new money to close the hole between that $683 trillion of false promises and the world's real GDP of $62 trillion. The only issue is who will take the hit. Up to now, the political influence of financial sectors has forced taxpayers to bail out financiers. The blatant unfairness and stupidity of this has caused huge outcries from outraged citizens.** Those billions given to irresponsible bankers could have financed universal healthcare and college education. This is the end of finance based only on money and fiat currencies. We now know it's about priorities and values. Enter the new financiers: those high-level information and knowledge brokers who understand our Information Age and the great transition from the fossil-fueled Industrial Age to our new Solar Age. Overloaded money-circuits have broken down and the huge new volume of transactions in the past decade have migrated to the internet. Pure information-based exchange and sharing has led to the new hybrid economic model described by experts, including Lawrence Lessig's Remix (2008), Yoichi Benkler's The Wealth of Networks (2007), Don Tapscott's Wikinomics (2008), Verna Allee's Knowledge Evolution (1997) and my own work ([www.ethicalmarkets.com](http://www.ethicalmarkets.com)). **This hybrid economy is half the old money-based competition and half information-based sharing, cooperation and exchange. ** From electronic stock exchanges, Instinet, Archipelago, NASDAQ, Knight and Entrex to Google, e-Bay, Craigslist, Amazon, Facebook and Wikipedia, we are seeing how money-obsessed financiers are trailing behind.

Money may return to its honest base, reflecting real world values of Main Street productivity, but may never again be the dominant medium of exchange. Just as gold remains valuable but can no longer support the new volume of human transactions. Money will be superseded by all the new digital currencies already circulating from local exchange trading systems (LETS) and complementary currencies like \"Berkshares\" and \"Wirs\" in Switzerland to Freecycle and many other barter sites, cell phone networks and radio shows. Incumbent money-circuit players will try to get regulators to shut down these upstart, disruptive technologies and competitors. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, shut down the website Prosper.com which boomed by facilitating local residents and businesses in lending to each other. The new financiers are operating these new digital trading platforms in many countries. Many designs for global digital currencies are on the way. They will complement the IMF's Special Drawing Rights, another pure information-based currency for international development which is still conceptually tied to gold. **The new financiers will show why the old financiers and central bankers can no longer have a monopoly on money and its creation. Information-based currencies and trading platforms will operate wherever necessary for evolving human communities so as to match needs with resources and create jobs - from local and regional to national and international exchange.** **Today's financial \"crisis\" is facilitating the evolutionary jump to the next stage of human development - shifting from faulty, money-measured GDP growth to the cleaner, greener, sustainable economies.** Governments are realizing that they must now also correct those money-based indicators and GDP national accounts to adopt the new Quality of Life Indicators. Pension funds have realized their errors in chasing only short-term money returns and are demanding that companies report their performance beyond the old single bottom line of money to the triple bottom line, including progress on social, environmental and governance performance.

[Matt Taibbi's recent article](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411) in *Rolling Stone* exposing major corruption among top bankers related to the banking bailout is just such an article. The Federal Reserve and top bankers [fought long and hard](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-federal-reserve-seeks-protect-us-bailout-secrets) to keep secret any records on what they did with taxpayer-financed bailout money. But a recent [U.S. Supreme Court ruling](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fed-release-bank-loan-data-after-supreme-court-rejects-appeal) forced the banks to open their records to what was done with the trillions of dollars of bailout money. The astonishing results are published in this revealing article. The revelations contained in these newly released records are simply stunning. Taibbi puts the spotlight on hundreds of millions of dollars in risk-free loans given to wives of Morgan Stanley executives who were behind an offshore company making strange investments. **He also asks how Libya's Muammar Qaddafi received over 70 loans from Federal Reserve bailout money.** Read the slightly edited article below to understand just how corrupt this system has become.

The official budget is public record and hotly debated: Money comes in as taxes and goes out as jet fighters, DEA agents, wheat subsidies and Medicare, plus pensions and bennies for that great untamed socialist menace called a unionized public-sector workforce. According to popular legend, we're broke and in so much debt that 40 years from now our granddaughters will still be hooking on weekends to pay the medical bills of this year's retirees from the IRS, the SEC and the Department of Energy.

What they don't know is that **there is another budget of roughly equal heft, traditionally maintained in complete secrecy. After the financial crash of 2008, it grew to monstrous dimensions,** as the government attempted to unfreeze the credit markets by handing out trillions to banks and hedge funds. And thanks to a whole galaxy of obscure, acronym-laden bailout programs, it eventually rivaled the \"official\" budget in size - a huge roaring river of cash flowing out of the Federal Reserve to destinations neither chosen by the president nor reviewed by Congress, but instead handed out by fiat by unelected Fed officials using a seemingly nonsensical and apparently unknowable methodology. **Now, following an act of Congress that has forced the Fed to open its books from the bailout era, this unofficial budget is for the first time becoming at least partially a matter of public record.** Staffers in the Senate and the House, whose queries about Fed spending have been rebuffed for nearly a century, are now poring over 21,000 transactions and discovering a host of outrages and lunacies in the \"other\" budget. It is as though someone sat down and made a list of every individual on earth who actually did not need emergency financial assistance from the United States government, and then handed them the keys to the public treasure. The Fed sent billions in bailout aid to banks in places like Mexico, Bahrain and Bavaria, billions more to a spate of Japanese car companies, more than $2 trillion in loans each to Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, and billions more to a string of lesser millionaires and billionaires with Cayman Islands addresses. \"Our jaws are literally dropping as we're reading this,\" says Warren Gunnels, an aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \"Every one of these transactions is outrageous.\" [Wall Street's Big Win](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/wall-streets-big-win-20100804) **If you want to get a true sense of what the \"shadow budget\" is all about, all you have to do is look closely at the taxpayer money handed over to a single company that goes by a seemingly innocuous name: Waterfall TALF Opportunity.** At first glance, Waterfall's haul doesn't seem all that huge - just nine loans totaling some $220 million, made through a Fed bailout program. That doesn't seem like a whole lot, considering that Goldman Sachs alone received roughly $800 billion in loans from the Fed. But upon closer inspection, **Waterfall TALF Opportunity boasts a couple of interesting names among its chief investors: Christy Mack and Susan Karches.** **Christy is the wife of John Mack, the chairman of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt:1:35a8d340f150", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8921, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Waterfall TALF Opportunity.** At first glance, Waterfall's haul doesn't seem all that huge - just nine loans totaling some $220 million, made through a Fed bailout program. That doesn't seem like a whole lot, considering that Goldman Sachs alone received roughly $800 billion in loans from the Fed. But upon closer inspection, **Waterfall TALF Opportunity boasts a couple of interesting names among its chief investors: Christy Mack and Susan Karches.** **Christy is the wife of John Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley. Susan is the widow of Peter Karches, a close friend of the Macks who served as president of Morgan Stanley's investment-banking division. Neither woman appears to have any serious history in business, apart from a few philanthropic experiences. Yet the Federal Reserve handed them both low-interest loans of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars through a complicated bailout program that virtually guaranteed them millions in risk-free income.** The technical name of the program that Mack and Karches took advantage of is TALF, short for Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. But the federal aid they received actually falls under a broader category of bailout initiatives, designed and perfected by Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, called \"giving already stinking rich people gobs of money for no ... reason at all.\" If you want to learn how the shadow budget works, follow along. This is what welfare for the rich looks like. In August 2009, John Mack, at the time still the CEO of Morgan Stanley, made an interesting life decision. Despite the fact that he was earning the comparatively low salary of just $800,000, and had refused to give himself a bonus in the midst of the financial crisis, Mack decided to buy himself a gorgeous piece of property - a 107-year-old limestone carriage house on the Upper East Side of New York, complete with an indoor 12-car garage, that had just been sold by the prestigious Mellon family for $13.5 million. Either Mack had plenty of cash on hand to close the deal, or he got some help from his wife, Christy, who apparently bought the house with him. The Macks make for an interesting couple. John, a Lebanese-American nicknamed \"Mack the Knife\" for his legendary passion for firing people, has one of the most recognizable faces on Wall Street, physically resembling a crumpled, half-burned baked potato with a pair of overturned furry horseshoes for eyebrows. Christy is thin, blond and rich - a sort of still-awake Sunny von Bulow with hobbies. Her major philanthropic passion is endowments for alternative medicine, and she has attained the level of master at Reiki, the Japanese practice of \"palm healing.\" The only other notable fact on her public résumé is that her sister was married to Charlie Rose. **It's hard to imagine a pair of people you would less want to hand a giant welfare check", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt:2:727bc50c3f52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8922, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "horseshoes for eyebrows.

Neither seems to have any experience whatsoever in finance, beyond Susan's penchant for dabbling in thoroughbred racehorses. But with an upfront investment of $15 million, they quickly received $220 million in cash from the Fed, most of which they used to purchase student loans and commercial mortgages. **The loans were set up so that Christy and Susan would keep 100 percent of any gains on the deals, while the Fed and the Treasury (read: the taxpayer) would eat 90 percent of the losses.** Given out as part of a bailout program ostensibly designed to help ordinary people by kick-starting consumer lending, the deals were a classic heads-I-win, tails-you-lose investment. So how did the government come to address a financial crisis caused by the collapse of a residential-mortgage bubble by giving the wives of a couple of Morgan Stanley bigwigs free money to make essentially risk-free investments in student loans and commercial real estate? The answer is: by degrees. The history of the bailout era reads like one of those awful stories about what happens when a long-dormant criminal compulsion goes unchecked. The Peeping Tom next door stares through a few bathroom windows, doesn't get caught, and decides to break in and steal a pair of panties. Next thing you know, he's upgraded to homemade dungeons, tri-state serial rampages and throwing cheerleaders into a panel truck. It was the same with the bailouts. They started out small, with the government throwing a few hundred billion in public money to prop up genuinely insolvent firms like Bear Stearns and AIG. Then came TARP and a few other programs that were designed to stave off bank failures and dispose of the toxic mortgage-backed securities that were a root cause of the financial crisis. But before long, the Fed began buying up every distressed investment on Wall Street, even those that were in no danger of widespread defaults: commercial real estate loans, credit- card loans, auto loans, student loans, even loans backed by the Small Business Administration. What started off as a targeted effort to stop the bleeding in a few specific trouble spots became a gigantic feeding frenzy. It was \"free money for sh**,\" says Barry Ritholtz, author of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt:3:1751b35d96fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8923, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "of the financial crisis.

What started off as a targeted effort to stop the bleeding in a few specific trouble spots became a gigantic feeding frenzy. It was \"free money for sh**,\" says Barry Ritholtz, author of Bailout Nation. \"It turned into 'Give us your crap that you can't get rid of otherwise.' \" The impetus for this sudden manic expansion of the bailouts was a masterful bluff by Wall Street executives. **Once the money started flowing from the Federal Reserve, the executives began moaning to their buddies at the Fed, claiming that they were suddenly afraid of investing in anything - student loans, car notes, you name it - unless their profits were guaranteed by the state.** \"You ever watch soccer, where the guy rolls six times to get a yellow card?\" says William Black, a former federal bank regulator who teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri. \"That's what this is. If you have power and connections, they will give you a freebie deal - if you're good at whining.\" This is where TALF fits into the bailout picture. Created just after Barack Obama's election in November 2008, the program's ostensible justification was to spur more consumer lending, which had dried up in the midst of the financial crisis. **But instead of lending directly to car buyers and credit-card holders and students - that would have been socialism! - the Fed handed out a trillion dollars to banks and hedge funds, almost interest-free. In other words, the government lent taxpayer money to the same [criminals] who caused the crisis, so that they could then lend that money back out on the market virtually risk-free, at an enormous profit.** Cue your Billy Mays voice, because wait, there's more! A key aspect of TALF is that the Fed doles out the money through what are known as non-recourse loans. Essentially, this means that if you don't pay the Fed back, it's no big deal. The mechanism works like this: Hedge Fund Goon borrows, say, $100 million from the Fed to buy crappy loans, which are then transferred to the Fed as collateral. If Hedge Fund Goon decides not to repay that $100 million, the Fed simply keeps its pile of crappy securities and calls everything even. This is the deal of a lifetime. Think about it: You borrow millions, buy a bunch of crap securities and stash them on the Fed's books. **If the securities lose money, you leave them on the Fed's lap and the public eats the loss.

But if they make money, you take them back, cash them in and repay the funds you borrowed from the Fed.** \"Remember that crazy guy in the commercials who ran around covered in dollar bills shouting, 'The government is giving out free money!' \" says Black. \"As crazy as he was, this is making it real.\" This whole setup - in which millionaires and billionaires gambled on mountains of dangerous securities, with taxpayers providing the stake and assuming almost all of the risk - is the reason that it's insanely premature for Wall Street to claim that the bailouts have actually made money for the government. We simply can't make that determination until the final bill comes in on all the dicey securities we financed during the bailout feeding frenzy. **In the case of Waterfall TALF Opportunity, here's what we know: The company was founded in June 2009 with $14.87 million of investment capital, money that likely came from Christy Mack and Susan Karches. The two Wall Street wives then used the $220 million they got from the Fed to buy up a bunch of securities, including a large pool of commercial mortgages managed by Credit Suisse, a company John Mack once headed. ** **Those securities were valued at $253.6 million, though the Fed refuses to explain how it arrived at that estimate. And here's the kicker: Of the $220 million the two wives got from the Fed, roughly $150 million had not been paid back as of last fall - meaning that you and I are still on the hook for most of whatever the Wall Street spouses bought on their government-funded shopping spree.** **The public has no way of knowing how much Christy Mack and Susan Karches earned on these transactions, because the Fed has repeatedly declined to provide any information about how it priced the individual securities bought as part of programs like TALF.** In the Waterfall deal, for instance, we know the Fed pledged some $14 million against a block of securities called \"Credit Suisse Commercial Mortgage Trust Series 2007-C2\" - but that data is meaningless without knowing how many units were bought. It's like saying the Fed gave Waterfall $14 million to buy cars. Did Waterfall pay $5,000 per car, or $500,000? We have no idea. \"There's no way of validating or invalidating the Fed's process in TALF without this pricing information,\" says Gary Aguirre, a former SEC official who was fired years ago after he tried to interview John", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt:5:219a5c5a31ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8925, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__bankers_wives_profit", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "securities called \"Credit Suisse Commercial Mortgage Trust Series 2007-C2\" - but that data is meaningless without knowing how many units were bought.

We have no idea. \"There's no way of validating or invalidating the Fed's process in TALF without this pricing information,\" says Gary Aguirre, a former SEC official who was fired years ago after he tried to interview John Mack in an insider-trading case. In early April, in an attempt to learn exactly how much Mack and Karches made on the TALF deals, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote a letter to Waterfall asking 21 detailed questions about the transactions. In addition, Sen. Sanders has personally asked Fed chief Bernanke to provide more complete information on the TALF loans given not only to Christy Mack but to gazillionaires like former Miami Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga and hedge-fund shark John Paulson. But Bernanke bluntly refused to provide the information - and the Fed has similarly stonewalled other oversight agencies, including the General Accounting Office and TARP's special inspector general. Christy Mack and Susan Karches did not respond to requests for comments for this story. But even without more information about the loans they got from the Fed, we know that TALF wasn't the only risk-free money being handed over to Wall Street. During the financial crisis, the Fed routinely made billions of dollars in \"emergency\" loans to big banks at near-zero interest. Many of the banks then turned around and used the money to buy Treasury bonds at higher interest rates - essentially loaning the money back to the government at an inflated rate. \"People talk about how these were loans that were paid back,\" says a congressional aide who has studied the transactions. **\"But when the state is lending money at zero percent and the banks are turning around and lending that money back to the state at three percent, how is that different from just handing rich people money?\"** Those kinds of deals were the essence of the bailout - and the vast mountains of near-zero government cash turned companies facing bankruptcy into monstrous profit machines. In 2008 and 2009, while Christy Mack was busy getting her little TALF loans for $220 million, her husband's bank hauled in $2 trillion in emergency Fed loans. During the same period, Goldman borrowed nearly $800 billion. Shortly afterward, the two banks reported a combined annual profit of $14.5 billion. As crazy as it is to lend to banks at near zero percent and borrow back from them at three percent, one could at least argue that the policy may have aided American companies by providing banks more cash to lend.** But how do you explain the host of other bailout transactions now being examined by Congress?

Or the nearly $5 billion in cheap credit the Fed extended to Toyota and Mitsubishi? ** Sure, those companies have factories and dealerships in the U.S. - but** does it really make sense to give them free cash at the same time taxpayers were being asked to bail out Chrysler and GM?** Seems a little crazy to fund the competition of the very automakers you're trying to rescue. And then there are the bailout deals that make no sense at all. [Some get] mad over spending on health care and school for Mexican illegals. So why aren't they flipping out over the $9.6 billion in loans the Fed made to the Central Bank of Mexico? How do we explain the $2.2 billion in loans that went to the Korea Development Bank, the biggest state bank of South Korea, whose sole purpose is to promote development in South Korea? **And at a time when America is borrowing from the Middle East at interest rates of three percent, why did the Fed extend $35 billion in loans to the Arab Banking Corporation of Bahrain at interest rates as low as 1/4 of one point?** **Even more disturbing, the major stakeholder in the Bahrain bank is none other than the Central Bank of Libya, which owns 59 percent of the operation.** In fact, the Bahrain bank just received a special exemption from the U.S. Treasury to prevent its assets from being frozen in accord with economic sanctions. That's right: **Muammar Qaddafi received more than 70 loans from the Federal Reserve, along with the Real Housewives of Wall Street.** Perhaps the most irritating facet of all of these transactions is the fact that **hundreds of millions of Fed dollars were given out to hedge funds and other investors with addresses in the Cayman Islands.** **Many of those addresses belong to companies with American affiliations - including prominent Wall Street names like Pimco, Blackstone and . . .

As America girds itself for another round of lunatic political infighting over which barely-respirating social program or urgently necessary federal agency must have their budgets permanently sacrificed to the cause of billionaires being able to keep their third boats in the water, it's important to point out just how scarce money isn't in certain corners of the public-spending universe. In the coming months, when you watch Republican congressional stooges play out the desperate comedy of solving America's deficit problems by making fewer photocopies of proposed bills, or by taking an ax to budgetary shrubberies like NPR or the SEC, remember Christy Mack and her fancy new carriage house. There is no belt-tightening on the other side of the tracks. Just a free lunch that never ends. **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this crucial information.

Striking examples can be found and verified in our [news archive on privacy and mass surveillance](https://www.wanttoknow.info/privacynewsstories). **Instead of having essential conversations about how our taxdollars are used that could bring us all together, we are succumbing to the fearmonging and distorted narratives so common in the media today.** The Treasury access that DOGE has been granted is [read-only](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/treasury-says-elon-musk-doge-has-read-only-access-to-payment-systems/), so public records can't be altered.

Before USAID became a polarizing topic in the news this year, it had already made headlines for years due to serious scandals. While its contributions to disaster relief and global aid are undeniable, it's just as important to consider what gets left out of the narrative. For example, *New York Times* reported in 2014 that USAID was used as a [front for CIA regime change operations](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/15/when-is-foreign-aid-meddling/secret-programs-hurt-foreign-aid-efforts) all over the world, including a USAID police training program that trained torturers.

Written by [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) news editor Mark Bailey, [*Free Mind Gazette*](https://freemindgazette.substack.com/) In my experience, there are three main things that attract people to crypto. First is the money. Second is the tech. And third is the freedom. Personally, I earn a little income from the sector and love playing around with the tech, but what keeps me coming back to crypto is its promise of a more free future ...

The highly centralized legacy system could experience shocks that interfere with or take down financial infrastructure. Decentralized crypto networks are resilient to even severe disruption. **Whole countries could go offline and every major blockchain would continue operating without interruption.** The political situation is dynamic and even volatile in many parts of the world, including the US.

And though most research for this article was done in 2010, the facts and principles uncovered are still very much in effect today. **CAFR: US agencies have billions, trillions in investments while crying budget deficits By Carl Herman **(edited for brevity and clarity) [Gerald Klatt](http://www.cafrman.com) and [Walter Burien](http://cafr1.com/) are are pioneering researchers who have revealed how government agencies quietly conceal American taxpayers' money in surplus accounts that collectively total literally trillions of taxpayers' dollars. The data is found and can be verified in publicly available documents for each governmental entity called [Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports](http://www.ofm.wa.gov/cafr/) (CAFRs). What CAFRs reveal is a little-known, yet deceptive policy whereby taxpayers collectively surrender enormous assets to the government, which then invests the trillions that swell in these accounts. As this money is secreted away, taxpayers are warned of debilitating budget deficits to either squeeze more taxes from them and/or cut public services. To add insult to injury, the state commits a gross lie of omission by never informing citizens of their withheld trillions as they eliminate jobs, reduce education, and attack the quality of our lives. The American Constitution is a contract of limited government whereby the public informs and is informed by our representatives. CAFRs are damning public documents that expose political leadership from both left and right as exactly what leading economic voices have said: a corrupt and self-serving oligarchy. Let's look at the economic data revealed in CAFRs for 2009. (More recent reports [available here](https://www.sco.ca.gov/ard_state_cafr.html)) Take California, for example, which had a 2009 budget deficit of about [$20 billion](https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052735/http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/fact-sheet/14147/). **The combined investments reported in 2009 CAFRs for the [state of California](http://www.sco.ca.gov/Files-ARD/CAFR/cafr09web.pdf), [Los Angeles County](http://file.lacounty.gov/lac/cms1_141548.pdf), and the [City of Los Angeles](http://ens.lacity.org/ctr/financial/ctrfinancial18265184_02262010.pdf) was over $450 billion!

That's over 22 times the amount of the budget shortfall!!! **Click on the links for verification. These governments claim they need this money mainly for public employee retirement benefits. Let's check that story. The CAFR data shows current member contributions pay for all retiree benefits except for $1.8 billion (net cost). If just these three state agencies paid off their budget deficits and paid the $1.8 billion in retirement benefits, the amount still remaining would be enough for each taxpayer in California (population 36 million, taxpayers less than 2/3 of this number) to receive well over $15,000. Why has political leadership and corporate media not informed American taxpayers of this intriguing option? And why isn't this data publicly submitted for professional and independent economist cost-benefit analysis to consider other options which benefit both government and the people? As we all know,[http://www.examiner.com/x-18425-LA-County-Nonpartisan-Examiner~y2010m4d29-Open-proposal-to-US-higher-education-End-unlawful-war-through-breakthrough-civic-education-2-of-4](http://www.examiner.com/x-18425-LA-County-Nonpartisan-Examiner~y2010m4d29-Open-proposal-to-US-higher-education-End-unlawful-war-through-breakthrough-civic-education-2-of-4) money talks and power corrupts. So far, we've only considered three CAFRs in the state of California. The comprehensive reality is far more dramatic. Looking at all of California's roughly 10,000 cities, counties, towns, and other government agencies,** the combined total assets reported in CAFR's for California alone is likely in the trillions of dollars.** Add in the other 49 states and we are talking astronomical figures. Obviously, we need independent auditing and economic cost-benefit analyses of all state and local CAFRs around the US in order to make clear choices on how the public benefit might best be served. In California, oppressed under a $20 billion dollar budget deficit that cuts education, child welfare, and other essential public services, the failure to redirect some of these vast sums of money to pay off the deficit and support social programs is a travesty. To put this into an analogy: This is like a teenager claiming to everyone that he needs money badly because the front pockets of his pants are empty, which he dutifully shows (budget debt). What he's not telling you is that his back pockets are stuffed with over 100 times the money he says he \"needs\" (shown in various places of the CAFRs). Whenever someone by chance sees the wads of money stuffed in his back pockets and asks him about it, he says, \"Oh, that money is being saved for when I need it much later. I can't touch that.\" So far, the silence of major media and political leadership from left and right on these vast CAFR funds is deafening. Of course, the politicians' claim of \"I can't touch that\" is a lie of omission, because it can be touched the moment policy changes. So the real issue is the heart", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__cafr_comprehensive_annual_financial_reports.txt:1:a2deb77816d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8935, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__cafr_comprehensive_annual_financial_reports.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__cafr_comprehensive_annual_financial_reports", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in his back pockets and asks him about it, he says, \"Oh, that money is being saved for when I need it much later.

Of course, the politicians' claim of \"I can't touch that\" is a lie of omission, because it can be touched the moment policy changes. So the real issue is the heart of economics: **what are the costs and benefits of different choices? ** **Here's the specific data and documentation:** Using the example of the [2009 California CAFR](http://www.sco.ca.gov/Files-ARD/CAFR/cafr09web.pdf), state pension and \"other\" trusts investments total $367 billion. Net pension benefits payable from that $367 billion in 2009 was $1.8 billion (retiree payouts minus current member contributions). Subtracting other liabilities ($48 billion in securities lending obligations - page 212), the state of California is holding onto over $300 billion of the public's money that could be used for other purposes (pages 48, 49). The misleading information on pages 154-155 of the California report suggests retirement funds are not fully funded. However, the fact is that over $300 billion is being held in investments for $1.8 billion paid out in net benefits. 1% interest on that $300 billion would fully cover those benefits with $1.2 billion to spare without even drawing down on the principal. $143 billion of the California CAFR surplus is invested in \"equity securities\" (stocks) and $92 billion in debt securities (page 83-84). $72 billion is dependent upon foreign markets (page 88). This means that the government quietly \"invests\" public moneys in Wall Street, big banks, government debts (which may not even be necessary given the existence of CAFR funds), and foreign corporations, likely gaining a return rate far in excess of 1% over the long run. The UC system, California's top network of universities, had a 2009-10 budget deficit of $0.65 billion. The [policy response](https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135342/https://www.tuftsdaily.com/budget-cuts-fee-increases-draw-anger-of-university-of-california-students-1.2175778) was to deny 2,300 students enrollment, lay off 2,000 faculty and staff, cut salaries 10%, and raise tuition 32%. For less than 1/3 of one percent of the investment total of California CAFR funds, UC could have been fully funded and those reductions eliminated. California's [20,000 laid-off teachers](https://web.archive.org/web/20101202080122/https://www.cta.org/About-CTA/News-Room/Press-Releases/2010/03/20100311_1.aspx) could be rehired at $70,000/year for $3.4 billion; less than 1% of these three CAFR \"investments\" total. [Los Angeles County](http://file.lacounty.gov/lac/cms1_141548.pdf) has $52 billion in investments (pages 61-63), the [City of Los Angeles](http://ens.lacity.org/ctr/financial/ctrfinancial18265184_02262010.pdf) has $36 billion (page 80).

According to the [most recent report](http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/dq311.pdf) from the U.S. government's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the total value of derivatives has increased approximately 1000% since 1996, and 250% since 2006 (see graph on page 12 of the OCC report). Derivatives continued their rapid climb even in the midst of the global recession that started in 2008. **Most disturbing is the fact that 95% of all U.S. derivatives are monopolized by just five megabanks and their holding companies.** The below verbatim excerpts from major media and government reports speak for themselves. What they don't mention is one simple measure which could greatly decrease the risk of the derivatives bubble bursting. A simple tax of 0.25% (1/4 of 1%) on each speculative financial transaction would change the whole risky game. European citizens pay a value added tax (VAT) of [15% or more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax#European_Union) and most U.S. citizens pay a state sales tax of [up to 13%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax#United_States) on purchased goods. So why not add just a small tax on all speculative transactions? This would also net hundreds of billions of dollars in tax receipts, easing the growing world debt. Thankfully, politicians are slowly becoming aware of the huge risk of the derivatives bubble and are [taking steps in the right direction](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/eu-derivatives-idUSL5E8D969P20120209), but there is a long way still to go. And the [financial speculation tax](http://www.cepr.net/index.php/issues/fst/) has yet to gain traction.

They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential.** Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk. In theory, this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrillion-dollar market. In practice, it also defends the dominance of the big banks.** The banks in this group ... have fought to block other banks from entering the market, and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available.** Banks' influence over this market, and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises, has costly implications for businesses large and small. The size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments. States and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs. Airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices. Food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef. **Note:** To explore highly revealing news articles on the powerful secret societies which without doubt back these top bankers, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles). **OCC's Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities: Third Quarter 2011** **December 2011, OCC (U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Administrator of National Banks)** [http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivativ...](http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/dq311.pdf) The OCC's quarterly report on trading revenues and bank derivatives activities is based on Call Report information provided by all insured U.S. commercial banks and trust companies, reports filed by U.S. financial holding companies, and other published data. The notional amount of derivatives held by insured U.S. commercial banks decreased $1.4 trillion, or 0.6%, from the second quarter of 2011 to $248 trillion.

Derivative contracts total about three-quarters of a quadrillion dollars in \"notional\" amounts, according to the Bank for International Settlements. These contracts are tallied in notional values because no one really can say how much they are worth. But valuing them correctly is exactly what we should be doing because these comprise the viral disease that has infected the financial markets and the economies of the world. Try as we might to salvage the residential real estate market, it's at best worth $23 trillion in the U.S. We're struggling to save the stock market, but that's valued at less than $15 trillion. And we hope to keep the entire U.S. economy from collapsing, yet gross domestic product stands at $14.2 trillion. Compare any of these to the derivatives market and you can easily see that we are just closing the windows as a tsunami crashes to shore. The total value of all the stock markets in the world amounts to less than $50 trillion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. To be sure, the derivatives market is international. But **much of the trouble we're in began with contracts \"derived\" from the values associated with U.S. residential real estate market. These contracts were engineered based on the various assumptions tied to those values. Few know what derivatives are worth.** I spoke with one derivatives trader who manages billions of dollars and she said she couldn't even value her portfolio because \"no one knows anymore who is on the other side of the trade.\" **Note:** The GDP of the entire world is estimated at [around $60 trillion](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&tdim=true&dl=en&hl=en&q=%22global+gdp%22).

The derivatives market has exploded in recent years, with investment banks selling billions of dollars worth of these investments to clients as a way to off-load or manage market risk. But **Mr Buffett argues that such highly complex financial instruments are time bombs and \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" that could harm not only their buyers and sellers, but the whole economic system.** Derivatives are financial instruments that allow investors to speculate on the future price of, for example, commodities or shares - without buying the underlying investment. Outstanding derivatives contracts - excluding those traded on exchanges such as the International Petroleum Exchange - are worth close to $85 trillion, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. Some derivatives contracts, Mr Buffett says, appear to have been devised by \"madmen\". He warns that derivatives can push companies onto a \"spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown\", like the demise of the notorious hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. **Note: **Investor Warren Buffett was ranked the [world's richest man](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Warren-Buffett_C0R3.html) by *Forbes* magazine in 2008.

Either way, they put their institutions at risk.\" And have yet to be held accountable. Commissioner Brooksley Born can enjoy a certain sense of vindication. Not only had \"over-the-counter derivatives contributed significantly to this crisis,\" ... but the enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban their regulation \"was a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis.\" As head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the 1990s, Born was aware of the damage the largely unregulated instruments had already caused. Born suggested some more regulation. [She] was squashed like a bug by Clinton administration heavyweights, including Lawrence Summers and Robert Rubin, [and] Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. One of the results:** The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 eliminated government oversight of the OTC market. As the report documents, the use of such derivatives ... helped bring the entire financial system to its knees.** Born hasn't seen much change in terms of accountability. One thing the report makes clear ... is just how preposterous were the \"Who knew?\" and \"Who could have predicted?\" statements offered up by chief executives and top government officials. **Note:** So the 10 biggest banks now control 63% of total U.S. bank assets.

Tett is a respected business journalist at the *Financial Times*. **Tett successfully pieces together the colorful backstory of the bank's work to win acceptance in the market for its brainchild, turning credit derivatives \"from a cottage industry into a mass-production business.\"** With the benefit of hindsight, we know that while these inventions were intended to control risk, they amplified it instead. This novel idea turned noxious when applied broadly to residential mortgages, a game that the rest of Wall Street later entered into with gusto. We learn in deep detail about not only how collateralized debt obligations are assembled but also their many iterations. Perhaps it's noteworthy that **Tett's book begins when JPMorgan had the face-value equivalent of $1.7 trillion in derivatives on its books. Today that number has jumped to a mind-boggling $87 trillion.** Part of that portfolio includes almost $8.4 trillion in credit derivatives, more than Bank of America's (BAC), Citi's, and Goldman Sachs' (GS) holdings combined. **Note:** So JP Morgan has $87 trillion in derivatives, a mass market it helped to create.

At the end of 2006, food prices across the world started to rise, suddenly and stratospherically. Within a year, the price of wheat had shot up by 80 per cent, maize by 90 per cent, rice by 320 per cent. In a global jolt of hunger, 200 million people - mostly children - couldn't afford to get food any more, and sank into malnutrition or starvation. There were riots in more than 30 countries, and at least one government was violently overthrown. Then, in spring 2008, prices just as mysteriously fell back to their previous level. Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, calls it \"a silent mass murder\", entirely due to \"man-made actions.\" **Through the 1990s, Goldman Sachs and others lobbied hard and the regulations [controlling agricultural futures contracts] were abolished. Suddenly, these contracts were turned into \"derivatives\" that could be bought and sold among traders who had nothing to do with agriculture.

As a replacement for oil, the elite and their [secret societies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) are increasingly targeting control of the world's food supply through [terminator crops](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-ministers-back-terminator-gm-crops) which produce no seed, and through the [patenting of seeds](http://www.no-patents-on-seeds.org/en/information/background/future-seeds-and-food). **Stock market time bomb?** **May 10, 2010, *Washington Times*** [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/10/stock-market-time-bomb/?page=all](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/10/stock-market-time-bomb/?page=all) Even the world's most savvy stock-market giants (e.g., Warren E. Buffett) have warned over the past decade that derivatives are the fiscal equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction. And the consequences of such an explosion would make the recent global financial and economic crisis seem like penny ante. But **generously lubricated lobbyists for the unrestricted, unsupervised derivatives markets tell congressional committees and government regulators to butt out. While banks all over the world were imploding and some $50 trillion vanished in global stock markets, the derivatives market grew by an estimated 65 percent**, according the Bank for International Settlements. BIS convenes the world's 57 most powerful central bankers in Basel, Switzerland, for periodic secret meetings. Occasionally, they issue a cry of alarm. This time, derivatives had soared from $414.8 trillion at the end of 2006 to $683.7 trillion in mid-2008 - 18 months' time. The derivatives market is now estimated at $700 trillion. What's so difficult to understand about derivatives? Essentially, they are bets for or against the house - red or black at the roulette wheel. Or betting for or against the weather in situations in which the weather is critical (e.g., vineyards). Forwards, futures, options and swaps form the panoply of derivatives. Credit derivatives are based on loans, bonds or other forms of credit. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are contracts that are traded and privately negotiated directly between two parties, outside of a regular exchange. All of this is unregulated. **Note:** This incisive article lays bare severe market manipulations that greatly endanger our world. The entire article is highly recommended.

Derivatives are financial instruments used to hedge risks or for speculation. They're derived from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific events such as changes in the weather or interest rates. Keeping such deals separate from FDIC-insured savings has been a cornerstone of U.S. regulation for decades, including last year's Dodd-Frank overhaul of Wall Street regulation. Three years after taxpayers rescued some of the biggest U.S. lenders, regulators are grappling with how to protect FDIC-insured bank accounts from risks generated by investment-banking operations. \"The concern is that there is always an enormous temptation to dump the losers on the insured institution,\" said William Black, professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a former bank regulator. \"We should have fairly tight restrictions on that.\" **Bank of America's holding company -- the parent of both the retail bank and the Merrill Lynch securities unit -- held almost $75 trillion of derivatives at the end of June. That compares with JPMorgan's deposit-taking entity, JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, which contained 99 percent of the New York-based firm's $79 trillion of notional derivatives.** **Note:** Remember that the GDP of the entire world is estimated at [around $60 trillion](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&tdim=true&dl=en&hl=en&q=%22global+gdp%22), less than JPMorgan or BofA own in derivatives.

The story is told in much more detail in *[All the Devils are Here](http://www.amazon.com/All-Devils-Are-Here-Financial/dp/159184438X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1331700285&sr=8-1)*, the latest, but eminently worthwhile, book on the roots of the crisis, by Bethany McLean and ... Joe Nocera. It makes for dispiriting, even appalling, reading. Responding to growing evidence of manipulation and fraud in unregulated derivatives trading - \"the hippopotamus under the rug,\" as Born and others referred to it - Born suggested the commission should perhaps be given some sort of oversight. She had a 33-page policy paper drawn up, full of questions and suggestions, like, for example, whether establishing a public exchange for derivatives might not be a bad idea. Responding to the policy paper, Summers, \"screaming at her,\" according to the book, told Born the bankers sitting in his office \"threatened to move their derivatives business to London,\" if she didn't stop. **Interview: Brooksley Born** **August 28, 2009, PBS Frontline** [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/interviews/born.html](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/interviews/born.html) As head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC], Brooksley Born became alarmed by the lack of oversight of the secretive, multitrillion-dollar over-the-counter derivatives market. **Her attempts to regulate derivatives ran into fierce resistance from then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and then-Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who prevailed upon Congress to stop Born and limit future regulation. **PBS: Let's start with September 2008 as we all sat there and watched the economy melting down. Born: It was like my worst nightmare coming true. I had had enormous concerns about the over-the-counter derivatives [OTC] market ... for a number of years. The market was totally opaque. Nobody really knew what was going on. And then it became obvious as Lehman Brothers failed, as AIG suddenly appeared to be on the brink of tremendous defaults and turned out [to have been a major derivatives] dealer. PBS: How did it happen? Born: It happened because there was no oversight of a very, very big, dynamic, growing market. I would never say derivatives should be banned or forbidden. The problem is that they can be extremely misused. Traditionally, government has had to protect the public interest by overseeing the marketplace and keeping the extreme behavior under some check.

This is the little-understood institution which prints and regulates all U.S. money. As inspector general, the Federal Reserve [website states](http://www.federalreserve.gov/oig/oig_bio.htm) Elizabeth Coleman is \"responsible for preventing and detecting waste, fraud, and abuse.\" Yet in eye-opening, videotaped Congressional testimony, Fed Inspector General Coleman acknowledged that she can't account for many trillions - yes *trillions* - of dollars of taxpayers' money. Do you know how much one trillion dollars is? It's over $3,000 for every man, woman, and child in the U.S. If you only count taxpayers, it's equivalent to $7,000 for every taxpayer. Yet Coleman acknowledges the Fed is not missing just $1 trillion, but many trillions of taxpayers' dollars. In the video clip she says she knows nothing about nine trillion dollars ($9,000,000,000,000) that is claimed to be unaccounted for. **That's $63,000 for each taxpayer. It's also three times the amount of the entire [annual federal budget](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN05297656) of the United States missing in action!** These numbers are simply staggering, yet they are getting amazingly little media coverage. There are many other problems with the Federal Reserve, which by the way, is not really federal nor a true reserve. Members of the Fed's board of governors are appointed by the president, yet during their 14-year terms the U.S. president and Congress have no power over them. **Even more revealing is the fact that the Fed is actually owned by the largest banks in the U.S.** Take a look and see you if can find who owns the Fed on [their website](http://www.federalreserve.gov). They avoid talking about this. Nor does the Fed have a full reserve as most people would expect.

A financial genius of the highest order, she moved up the ranks rapidly first on Wall Street and then in the U.S. government, becoming the Assistant Secretary of HUD (Housing and Urban Development) under George H.W. Bush in 1989. Yet Fitts has always been a woman of very high ethics and standards. **After revealing huge amounts of corruption worth literally trillions of dollars and trying to stanch this egregious loss of taxpayers' money, she was sacked from her government position and later attacked in a variety of ways. Though [the evidence is undeniable](https://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary), very powerful groups don't want the public to know about this massive, ongoing corruption. ** Houses are by far the largest purchase many people ever make. By manipulating mortgages and creating bubbles and the ensuing crashes, the powerful elites behind these manipulations gain many billions in profits as home owners lose their homes and hard-earned money to foreclosure. The huge manipulations of mortgages and the housing markets is a big part of what Fitts worked to uncover. Yet her personal story reveals so much more of what's happening behind the scenes. Below is an incisive summary of a much longer autobiographical essay written by Fitts describing her harrowing journey from growing up in a modest, multi-racial West Philadelphia neighborhood to being partner and managing director of a major Wall Street firm, and then on to the highest levels of government, where she was eventually attacked for exposing major corruption. Ever since leaving government, Fitts has been a tireless crusader not only revealing the depths of depravity of certain very powerful elite groups, but also presenting practical solutions for how to build a better world. **If you want to understand some of the key hidden forces which shape our world, this essay is a must read.** Please spread the word, so that we might help to make a real change for the better.

An excellent [82-minute video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0mimIp8mr8) by Fitts also covers similar topics. **Missing Money: A Personal History**** By Catherine Austin Fitts April 7, 2019** My mother's body was found on the roof of our home in February 1976. I knew my father agreed with me that it was an assassination. It fell to me to ... take charge of the family and funeral arrangements. I believed that if I handled matters discreetly, I could protect my father from a similar fate. However, he died four years later under suspicious circumstances. The lies surrounding their deaths became part of the accumulated lies that eventually destroyed what remained of our family. In the meantime, the machinery that harvests people and neighborhoods with a lethal combination of drugs, media, mortgage fraud, and enforcement kept getting more powerful. I wanted to know why. One of the things I learned growing up was that the fastest way for me to understand reality was to identify the actual transactions that were happening and estimate the allocation of time and resources, or, \"how the money worked.\" I was told as a young child that I tested as a math genius. Converting the gruesome or incomprehensible side of life into a mathematical flow seemed to my childlike mind a practical way of unpacking the mysteries of adult behavior. I got a better understanding of what was happening by following transactions than if I relied on people's description of what was happening or depended on the local and national news media. What people said they were doing and what they were actually doing were distinctly different things. I attended Wharton - the business school at the University of Pennsylvania - from 1976-78, receiving my MBA in the spring of 1978. Still trying to understand \"how the money worked,\" I joined Goldman Sachs as an intern for the summer of 1977 and then, after graduation, headed to New York and a job in investment banking on Wall Street at Dillon Read & Co., Inc. I was going to learn how the money worked and do something about it. Investment banking suited me. I developed a reputation for taking on the transactions that others thought could not be done - typically, transactions that involved many different constituencies and financial flows. I liked sorting out highly complicated public-private financial flows. I liked working with people from scores of different industries, places, and worlds. **I became a managing director and member of the board of directors in eight years - a record time. I could not imagine that I would ever have a career other than as an equity owner of Dillon", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:banking_finance__trillions-missing-catherine-austin-fitts.txt:1:951bf0f5df18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8953, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "banking_finance__trillions-missing-catherine-austin-fitts.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "banking_finance__trillions-missing-catherine-austin-fitts", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the transactions that others thought could not be done - typically, transactions that involved many different constituencies and financial flows.

I liked working with people from scores of different industries, places, and worlds. **I became a managing director and member of the board of directors in eight years - a record time. I could not imagine that I would ever have a career other than as an equity owner of Dillon Read.** I did not love everything and everyone in the environment, but I loved my investment banking work. There were several reasons why I [eventually went] to work in the federal government. I had become convinced after eleven years on Wall Street - with exposure to many different parts of the economy and financial markets - that the U.S. economy was engineered through Washington by monetary policy engineered by the Federal Reserve and fiscal policy engineered by Congress and the Executive branch. To understand how the money in one neighborhood in West Philadelphia worked - let alone figure out how to get it to work well - I needed to understand federal finances. Another reason was that I was confident that entering government service would ensure that the business I had built would stay at Dillon Read. Keeping this promise to [Dillon Read chairman Nick] Brady and the firm was very important to me. My loyalty was not reciprocated. I went to work at HUD despite the fact that Nick Brady, now Secretary of the Treasury in President George H.W. Bush's administration, blackballed me with the Bush transition team. I now believe that Brady did so for reasons relating to my parents' deaths, although it took me many years to come to that conclusion. A member of the transition team insisted that [incoming Secretary of HUD, Jack] Kemp and Brady loathed each other, which is how I got the interview with Kemp. Kemp had a HUD scandal on his hands and wanted someone clean with strong financial credentials. **As Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, I was responsible for the operations of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which was the largest mortgage insurance fund in the world.** FHA at that time had annual originations of $50-100 billion of mortgage insurance and an outstanding official portfolio of $320 billion of mortgage insurance, mortgages and properties. (Note: Today, it is officially $1.1 trillion.) Leading the FHA necessitated significant understanding of how homes are built, how mortgages finance thousands of communities throughout America and how investors finance the process by buying securities in pools of mortgages. My responsibilities included the ... management of an organization of 7,000 employees in 80 offices nationwide; and development of network information systems and tools. In addition, I served as advisor to the Secretary of HUD on financial markets regulatory responsibilities.

My responsibilities included the ... management of an organization of 7,000 employees in 80 offices nationwide; and development of network information systems and tools. In addition, I served as advisor to the Secretary of HUD on financial markets regulatory responsibilities. Shortly after arriving at HUD in April 1989, I began to learn about the FHA Coinsurance program. Since 1984, HUD/FHA had allowed private mortgage bankers to issue federal credit to guarantee multi-family apartment projects. **After issuing $9 billion in mortgage guarantees, HUD/FHA was to lose something approaching 50% of the value of the portfolio - a level of losses hard to explain with mortal logic. ** **When my staff approached me with a proposal to bail out a mortgage company so they could continue to lose money for us, I asked why we should spend money to lose more money in a way that would harm communities, not to mention the transaction they were proposing was illegal. After a long silence during which 30 staff members intently studied their feet, one brave soul explained to me that the mortgage bank was owned and run by a major Republican donor.** Shocked, I said, \"I am a major Republican donor,\" and pointing to my presidential cuff links that were adorning my French cuffs, \"I got a pair of cuff links. You get cuff links [for a big donation]. You don't get $400 million of federal credit to throw down the drain.\" My staff looked at me like I was so naive and clueless that there was no point in trying to communicate with me - better to let me learn the hard way. **Within minutes, a screaming [HUD Secretary] Jack Kemp, furious that I had not provided illegal subsidy to keep the mortgage banking company going (despite his orders to stop anything corrupt or illegal), called me on the carpet. The problems were compounded by the opinion of HUD General Counsel Frank Keating, who had joined from DOJ, that we did not have to honor our contracts. Rather we could abrogate contracts and ignore the law. If those who had been harmed sued us, Frank said, by the time they won \"we will be gone.\" ** **There are as many ways to steal money from HUD and the federal government as there are recipes in the *Joy of Cooking* cookbook.** As long as the federal government can collect taxes and sell Treasury securities and the Federal Reserve banks operate a fiat currency system supported by a global military, both without real audits or lawful disclosure by agency and Congressional district, there are always more assets and money that can go missing.

I never intended to spend 30 years of my life trying to prevent U.S. federal financial fraud [and] warning my fellow citizens and investors about it. I never expected to spend countless hours, year after year for three decades, reading complex, purposefully obtuse federal financial audits. **I never expected to deal with physical harassment, poisonings, house break-ins, trolls, disinformation shills, limited modified hangout experts, hackers, and the endless, mind-numbing parade of swamp critters that protect the monies rolling out of the back doors of the U.S. government. ** Those were never on my list of life goals. I did it because the federal finances are at the heart of the matter - a door that every American citizen has to walk through if we are going to be able to survive, let alone be healthy and free. When I started [Hamilton](https://www.dunwalke.com/gideon/about/index.html) [after leaving my government position], I wanted to build an investment bank that would create real wealth - that would take new technology and apply it in practical ways that would help individuals, families, businesses, and communities be more productive. Indeed, our prototyping at Hamilton indicated that the wealth potential was explosive. That is how we end poverty - by creating wealth. Those hopes ended with the failure of the Clinton administration and Congress to reach a budget deal and with the U.S. federal government shutdown at the end of 1995. As the president of CalPERS, the largest pension fund in the country, explained to me in the spring of 1997, \"They have given up on the country. They are moving all the money out starting in the fall.\" The financial coup d'état had begun. Among many other things, that meant bubbling the housing market in a manner that would generate significant funds and doing so with a significant round of new mortgage fraud. This was a coordinated effort by the leading member banks of the New York Federal Reserve and the federal agencies involved in housing and finance, including Treasury, the DOJ, and HUD.

I deferred my response and asked them the same question in return. **The staff member looked me dead in the eye and said, \"HUD is being run as a criminal enterprise.\"** HUD's matrix structure means that the majority of its operations are run by large defense contractors, New York Fed member banks, the U.S. Treasury, and the Department of Justice - and those parties indeed were intentionally running HUD as a criminal enterprise. As the propagandists love to say, on September 11, 2001, \"the world changed.\" Suddenly, money could pour out of both the front and back doors of the U.S. government into the military-industrial complex with abandon. America was going to war, and money was no object. DOD won an immediate $48 billion increase in appropriations. Suddenly, no one cared that there was [$3.3 trillion missing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary) from DOD and HUD. The spigot was open for fresh new cash. A great deal happened that day to make sure the trail on the money missing from DOD and HUD went cold, including bombing the offices of the largest mortgage and government securities dealers in the country, SEC and FBI offices in New York with ongoing investigations of Wall Street firms involved in the mortgage and securities fraud, as well as Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) offices at the Pentagon that were investigating the missing money. **Slowly, as the pieces fit together, we shared a horrifying epiphany: the banks, corporations, and investors acting in each global region were the exact same players. They were a relatively small group that reappeared again and again in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Asia accompanied by the same well-known accounting firms and law firms. Clearly, there was a global financial coup d'état underway.** The general theory ... is that the U.S. and other global militaries are dealing with unusual and dangerous phenomena. Consequently, the proponents of this premise call for secrecy, making it essential to centralize control over all aspects of the government and economy, with no expense spared and no questions asked. However, they never offer any explanation for why this has to come with trillions of dollars of waste and destructive corruption by insiders. Allowed to grow for decades, secrecy misused accumulates significant legal liabilities while generating huge and hideous profits. This is why I often say that secrecy has become a financial addiction.

This total commitment was almost double the entire economic output of the United States. If there were ever a single number that demonstrated the panic felt by the regulators during the financial crisis, it was that $23.7 trillion.\" ~ Neil Barofsky, Special Inspector General to the TARP Program, U.S. Department of Treasury** In April, 2006, I published [*Dillon Read & Co. Inc. & the Aristocracy of Stock Profits*](https://dillonreadandco.com/). The response to the book was quite gratifying. However, every time I tried to publish it in hard copy, the headwinds would begin. I interpreted the third and final threat as one that threatened a family member. I decided not to publish it in book form but to keep it online. Feelings were still too raw. Among other things, I had to make a choice between my pathway and my family. If I was going to continue on this path, I had to do it alone and put more space between myself and my family. My first job helping individuals and families was helping people navigate the financial crisis. Wall Street had started to quietly bet against the subprime mortgage market in 2006, with the market collapsing in 2007. Events blossomed into the financial crisis in 2008. The leadership who runs the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve brought it up - and then they brought it down. **When it comes to missing money, it's a global world in which things are never what they seem. But for as long as I have lived, the more money that goes missing, the more money is available to lobby, legislate, enforce, and fund more secrecy.** \"The two candidates that we have just had offered to us in [the 2016] election, both of them made comments and one of them had a profession that dictated this ... that they were going to continue to play by that playbook.

And they will continue to recover as long as [Trump] remains somewhat conciliatory and doesn't look like he is going to throw the playbook out. Just imagine if he suddenly decided that he would - and it might be beneficial to the country that he did. Then you see what I am talking about now because the markets will go all over the place again. Because the markets are part of this state. **The markets are part of waging war. They are part of the [warfare state](https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket). Our entire financial system now is geared to this warfare state.** That's how it survives. That's how it makes a lot of its profits. Not for nothing was HSBC found out for laundering drugs. You know where a lot of those drugs were coming from? ...Afghanistan. This is a vicious many-headed animal that we have allowed to grow up - as Eisenhower predicted - and if we are not careful it is going to eat all of our lunches before it is through with us.\" ~ Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson If it's not a problem for $21 trillion to go missing from DOD and HUD and it is possible to come up with more than $20+ trillion to give or loan to the banks when there is no legal obligation to do so, and when we can transfer trillions of the most valuable technology in the world to private corporations at zero cost to them and great cost to the taxpayers, I assure you that fixing whatever pension fund problem there is, is not difficult. However, the political will must exist. **If we can print money to give $20+ trillion to the banks and let [$21 trillion go missing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/b/missing-trillions) from the federal government, why is it a problem to print $5 trillion to fund the pension funds?** I would add that this also holds true for addressing the fraudulent inducement of American students with $1 trillion of student loan debt or the bankrupting of millions of Americans with an overly expensive health care system and suppression of economic health care treatments, among other items.

The missing money issue came to a head in October 2018. DOD was struggling to complete an audit. Before they finalized the process - as they could not complete an audit - the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) issued its Statement 56 with adoption by the GAO and OMB - essentially authorizing secret books with the approval of both the Trump administration in the White House and the Republican and Democratic leadership in the House and Senate. **In a nutshell, Statement 56, in combination with other classification and black budget laws, gives government agencies and private corporations the ability to make their financial information secret, resulting in financial statements that are misleading, provided that they do so based on an argument that the information they are leaving out or doctoring is related to a national security concern. DOD exercised the use of FASAB 56 before finalizing the audit process. What that meant is that the financial report DOD published at the completion of its non-audit was essentially meaningless.** **No one noticed the adoption of FASAB 56 on October 4, 2018 to end federal financial reporting - essentially shredding the Constitution.** Two days earlier, Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist for the *Washington Post* ... was assassinated at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In addition, Congress was in the middle of the Kavanaugh nomination hearings and related allegations over the sexual practices of teenagers. Whether murder or sex, the shriek-o-meter made sure the most important story of the year was not mentioned or noticed, let alone understood. The adoption of FASAB 56 in October 2018 has dramatic implications that most Americans and global investors are struggling to fathom. In frustration, I sent the following description to Matt Taibbi as he was writing [a piece on FASAB 56](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/secret-government-spending-779959/) for *Rolling Stone*: **\"The story is simple. [It's] about secret financing for secret armies.** **The U.S. government just officially changed its governance model from a constitutional republic to fascism through an obscure accounting policy.** **The U.S. Treasury is free to tax and then borrow from our pension funds and global and domestic investors and then transfer the money and assets ... to private corporations and investors without compensation or oversight**. Think of this as the extension of the bailouts to a permanent open bailout structure.

Every mercenary on the planet is now generating proposed schemes to create business for themselves that pumps up U.S. corporate profits and campaign contributions. Why do you think Mattis is suddenly out and ads are suddenly running that 'Blackwater is Coming'? My advice? Ask now former DOD Secretary Mattis - who opposed mercenary armies - how he feels about using his credibility to arrange significant increases in DOD appropriations and then getting the boot as soon as the mechanism to finance secret private armies goes into place.\" In December [2018], the ascension of the Bush team and neocons continued. William Barr, Attorney General during the George H.W. Bush administration, was nominated for Attorney General in the Trump administration. Barr served in the office of legal counsel at the CIA in 1976 when George H.W. Bush was confirmed as Director of Central Intelligence as a result of support from Dick Cheney, the Chief of Staff, and Donald Rumsfeld, then Secretary of Defense. Barr's job included helping Bush shut down the [Church Committee hearings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee). As his confirmation hearings proceeded, I wondered, did he see the lists of Americans scheduled for assassination to shut the Church Committee hearings down? Did he see my mother's name on the list? It's amazing how events keep coming back around to a few simple things. Perhaps time is circular. **Note:** The much longer original essay, available on [this webpage](https://hudmissingmoney.solari.com/2019/04/07/missing-money-a-personal-history-1989-to-2019) of her website [solari.com](https://solari.com), is quite riveting.

Very few college graduates have been taught about the role of money and banking in the development of civilization or even in our current world. This online lesson teaches basic monetary history and inspires us to build a better world through transforming our relationship with money. **Transforming Our Relationship with Money ** [https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/18a_money_matters](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/18a_money_matters) **Banking Corruption Facts and Information Subtopics ** ***Confessions of an Economic Hit Man* by John Perkins **- A seven-page summary [https://www.WantToKnow.info/johnperkinseconomichitman](https://www.WantToKnow.info/johnperkinseconomichitman) ***A Brief History of Banking* by Nick Sandberg **- An excellent five-page summary [https://www.WantToKnow.info/totalcontrol#one](https://www.WantToKnow.info/totalcontrol#one) ***A History of Banking and Money* by Carroll Quigley **- A ten-page summary [https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history) **What You Can Do About the Banking Corruption ** We have no doubt that by working together we can and will build a brighter future.

However, by deliberately curving the local spacetime (e.g., as in Bohren's experiment and in the negative resonance absorption of the medium), the divergence of the curl is not zero, and additional energy is freely collected from the neglected Heaviside component. Bohren's straightforward experiment yields COP = 18. The simple funding of a few doctoral theses and post-doctoral physics projects in this area for three years or so would very quickly solve the energy crisis forever, very cheaply. *All EM power systems already exhibit COP >>1.0, if their arbitrarily discarded Heaviside energy flow component is accounted* *and if it were deliberately used as an extra huge environmental energy reservoir from which copious extra EM energy were freely extracted.* E.g., if a present coal-burning plant were modified with a Bohren-process so that it \"amplified\" the heat input of the combustion process by a factor of 10, then only 10% of the present coal would have to be burned in that modified plant to produce its same electrical power output. The beneficial impact on the environment would be incalculable, and with less coal burned, additional pollution-reducing methods could be afforded and applied. No one in DoE, any other federal agency, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation, DARPA, the national laboratories, or our universities has even considered it-or apparently even thought of it.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:beardenmeg.txt:16:19eac19b91fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8983, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Behind the Scenes Behind the Scenes Summary Dr. Peter Beter ** \"To most people war is a supreme evil to be avoided if at all possible.

At that time Dr. Beter was in great demand to appear on talk shows nationwide, which he did in most cases by long-distance telephone hookup from his residence in suburban Washington, D.C. After many years as a highly successful Washington attorney, government official and international legal and financial consultant, Dr. Beter had become famous in 1973 as the author of a best-selling book, *The Conspiracy Against the Dollar*. **In his talk shows Dr. Beter had a habit of saying things which sounded preposterous at the time, but which were proven correct later on.** Early in 1973 he declared that Vice President Spiro Agnew would be swept up in a sudden scandal beginning in late summer that would lead quickly to his resignation. At the time Agnew was flying high, and it sounded like an unlikely turn of events. But it happened, right on schedule. In the spring of 1974, Dr. Beter described a sequence of events by which the Watergate Scandal would make Richard Nixon the first U.S. President in history to resign. At the time, Watergate seemed to be running out of steam, and Nixon appeared to be \"toughing it out.\" Even less believably, **Dr. Beter described a secret agreement which he said existed by which then-Vice President Gerald Ford would nominate Nelson Rockefeller to be his new Vice President after Nixon resigned. **In the spring of 1974 those things sounded hard to believe indeed.

But they took place. Dr. Beter claimed that events like these, while shocking to the public, were planned far in advance. He said that they were known within certain intelligence and even business circles here in America and abroad. **Drawing upon his extensive contacts with these circles, Dr. Beter was making public what the privileged few already knew.** Having begun as skeptical listeners to Dr. Beter's radio appearances, a small group of private citizens became increasingly concerned as they saw Dr. Beter's revelations proven correct, time after time. They decided to investigate further, and finally contacted him. In September, 1974, Audio Books, Inc., was founded by these supporters of Dr. Beter to provide an avenue by which Dr. Beter could make his reports public without censorship or cutoff by those who controlled the radio waves. After several individual AUDIO BOOK tapes, the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series began in 1975. **About Dr. Beter** (Born June 21, 1921; died March 14, 1987) Professional credentials: The things made public by Dr. Beter are extraordinary - but so is the professional background which preceded his public visibility. He practiced general law in Washington, D.C., from 1951 to 1961, qualifying to present cases to the U.S. Court of Military Appeals in 1952 and the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. Many of his cases were against the federal government, all of which he won - including one case in which he caught none other than the U.S. Department of Justice burning records in an attempt to defeat him. The resulting decision - Farley vs. U.S., 131 C. Cls. 776 (1955), 127 F Supp. 562 - made new law. **In 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed Dr. Peter Beter Counsel to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the largest government-owned bank in the Western world, where he served until 1967.** After leaving the Ex-Im Bank, Dr. Beter became an international financial and legal consultant, as well as one of the chief developers of private international business in the Republic of Zaire. He was a member of the Judicature Society, the Bankers' Club of America, the Royal Commonwealth Society of London, and the United States Naval Institute. He is listed in biographical reference works such as Who's Who in the East, the Blue Book of London, and 2000 Men of Achievement (London). Dr. Peter Beter (yes, it rhymes) first came to widespread popular attention in 1973, through his best-selling nonfiction book, [*The Conspiracy Against the Dollar*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080760710X/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&seller=).

It was a gripping tale of international economic intrigue and monetary manipulation, carried out by the coordinated action of multinational corporations grown more powerful than many of their host countries. **The objective: to deliberately undermine and ultimately destroy the United States dollar, as a major tool of political and economic conquest under the banner of a \"new imperialism.\"** A crescendo of unhappy consequences were to be expected: an accelerating economic \"stagflation\" (a now-popular word coined years ago by Dr. Beter), deteriorating financial status of municipal and state governments, deepening social unrest, increasing tensions over the Panama Canal, and more. Events during the past decade have followed to an astonishing degree the blueprint which Dr. Beter revealed in his book. In September 1974 Dr. Beter acquired a new distinction as \"the man who opened Fort Knox.\" The previous April **Dr. Beter had charged in congressional testimony that the legendary U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox had been looted of America's monetary gold hoard allegedly stored there. **He stood ready to present evidence and witnesses to substantiate his charges. But neither a grand jury nor a congressional inquiry into the matter materialized ... so Dr. Beter then took his case directly to the public. Through lectures, radio talk shows, and publication of his charges in a tabloid newspaper (National Tattler), he was able to put such intense pressure on the federal government that a completely unprecedented step was taken in order to still the public outcry. The U.S. Treasury Department arranged a so-called \"gold inspection\" visit for a few Congressmen and 100 invited newsmen on September 23, 1974. Significantly, however, Dr. Beter himself was not among those invited ... nor was any other outside expert on gold. The celebrated Fort Knox visit and the so-called \"gold audit\" which followed contained many irregularities which the Treasury Department has never explained. In AUDIO LETTER tapes #14 and #15 (July and August 1976), Dr. Beter made public intelligence he had been given that the Soviet Union was planting short-range underwater missiles in U.S. territorial waters in preparation for a surprise nuclear attack. In issue #15 he listed navigational coordinates for 64 missiles which he said had been planted worldwide so far ... urged his listeners to pressure the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take counteractive measures ... and in effect dared the government to prove him wrong.

The resulting hue and cry from Dr. Beter's listeners nationwide created shock waves within the U.S. Government which were never reported by the major news media. In mid-September 1976, Dr. Beter and an associate met for over an hour with General George S. Brown, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Gen. Brown's Pentagon office. Only two weeks earlier, a letter over Gen. Brown's signature had been sent to Dr. Beter (with photocopies to concerned citizens nationwide), seeming to say that Dr. Beter's charges about Soviet underwater missiles had been investigated and found untrue. Yet when Dr. Beter then requested a meeting with Gen. Brown to relay to him the locations of a second round of 48 newly-planted missiles, the meeting was granted without delay. The Pentagon confirmed to the press that the meeting had taken place*, but never explained this curious sequence of events. *See, e.g., Norfolk (Va.) Ledger-Star, Sept. 27, 1976, p. E8, article by G. Bradshaw and J. Kestner. Or see Chicago Tribune, Dec. 4, 1977, Section 2, \"Special Report: Undersea Warfare.\" **A Bird's-Eye View of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER** Excerpted from the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER REFERENCE DIGEST, Audio Books Inc., 1983 The 80 cassette tapes which make up the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series contain an enormous amount of information. In this \"Bird's-Eye View\" section, we will try to boil down the broad insights of the series as concisely as possible. We will keep details to a minimum, aside from examples to illustrate particular points. In the long term, it is this broader picture of the basic forces behind current events which is the most important of all to understand. Even though some of the developments discussed have run their course, the forces which brought them about continue to operate today. **Comprehending how those forces led to yesterday's events is the key to seeing through countless new events today and tomorrow.** **Politics: The Three Rival Factions for World Power** Decades ago Franklin D. Roosevelt said: \"Nothing in politics ever happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.\" Decades earlier Benjamin Disraeli, famed as the Victorian-era Prime Minister of Britain, wrote: \"The world is governed by people far different from those imagined by the public.\" Taken together, these two statements illustrate the basic premise which underlies all of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER tape reports. **This premise is that major events in politics, economics and international relations are the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:3:b17fed9f803a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8987, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "said: \"Nothing in politics ever happens by accident.

All of these factions seek to increase their influence over us, the general population of the world. Each one also wishes to increase its own power at the expense of the other power factions.** Thus there is an ongoing power struggle of titanic dimensions which constantly shapes the news, yet which is little understood - indeed unsuspected - by most people. If these forces are not recognized or understood, current events are inherently baffling, no matter how diligently one may follow the news. This leaves even the best-educated and most intelligent of persons vulnerable to manipulation to suit the purposes of those who pull the strings behind the scenes. By contrast, if the largely unseen forces are known and understood, major events become far more understandable and even, to some extent, predictable. Those informed about these things become far less vulnerable and more difficult to fool by manipulated news and news events. To choose just one of the many dramatic examples from the AUDIO LETTER series, consider the Guyana Massacre at Jonestown in November, 1978.** From start to finish, the Guyana story was filled with anomalies, unanswered questions, conflicting government statements, and news reports that did not quite add up.** It began with the slaughter of a U.S. Congressman and accompanying newsmen, yet there was never a subsequent congressional investigation. The victims died of cyanide poisoning, an excruciating death which leaves the face contorted in agony, yet the victims were found arranged in neat, peaceful-looking rows ... face-down. A few days after the massive infusion of American military teams supposedly for clean-up operations, there were sudden huge jumps in body-bag counts. Hurried explanations by Pentagon spokesmen were so incredible that they were withdrawn and replaced by different stories. These and many more oddities about the Guyana episode were never resolved, but simply left to fade away from the public memory with time. For those unaware of the behind-the-scenes forces at work in the world, Guyana will remain forever unexplained ... as if events so bizarre, major and chilling can happen for no reason at all. **The key missing ingredient in all the news reports about Guyana was the existence of a secret Soviet intermediate-range missile base, not far from Jonestown.** Dr. Beter had reported publicly about the base on many occasions for over four years prior to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:4:20d88f4d73b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8988, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "public memory with time.

He had also reported on the collapse of a cooperative arrangement formerly in effect between the true rulers of the United States and those of the Soviet Union. **These were the factors which led directly to the Jonestown tragedy - a mass murder, staged as a cover to enable covert military action against the Russian missile base.** Within days after the Jonestown tragedies, Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER #40 made public exactly what had taken place and why. In that tape Dr. Beter answered in detail questions which otherwise remain unanswered to this day. Over the course of the 80 AUDIO LETTER tape reports, Dr. Beter reveals that three primary power factions are at work in the world today: ** 1. The Rockefeller Cartel 2. The Bolshevik-Zionist Axis 3. The New Kremlin Rulers** These factions as such have existed for the past century or so, and their relationships with one another have been in a constant state of flux. Their roots, however, are much older and can be traced backward in time for many centuries. **The Rockefeller Cartel** The Rockefeller Cartel is the first of the three great power factions to be dealt with extensively in the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER reports, for at least two reasons. First, while its scope is worldwide, it is headquartered in the United States. Second, **it was indisputably the most powerful of the three factions when Dr. Beter began recording his AUDIO LETTER reports in 1975.** This situation changed dramatically later on. The Rockefeller Cartel today embraces several hundred of the world's largest multinational corporations - big oil, big banking and big business. It is a new kind of empire, with economic assets so great as to be beyond effective control by mere governments. Its headquarters are American, but its perspective is global, with allegiance neither to the United States nor to any other country. It is an empire unto itself. What is today the Rockefeller Cartel was started over a century ago by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. By his well-known cutthroat business tactics Rockefeller created the Standard Oil trust and made himself America's first billionaire by the turn of the century. Such blatantly unethical practices led to public opposition which culminated in the Supreme Court decree of 1911 dissolving the Standard Oil trust.

Such blatantly unethical practices led to public opposition which culminated in the Supreme Court decree of 1911 dissolving the Standard Oil trust. By then, however, Rockefeller was becoming more sophisticated, finding ways to hide the true extent of his wealth and power while continuing to expand it. The \"trust-busting\" era had little lasting effect: by the use of nominees and other devices it was possible to retain effective control and coordination of the superficially dismantled Standard Oil empire. Throughout the Twentieth Century, from World War I onward, Rockefeller economic power has translated increasingly into Rockefeller political power. This, in turn, has been used to increase Rockefeller economic power still further. For example, **oil has played a key role in all of America's major wars of this century, with the Rockefeller oil interests profiting handsomely. Yet this role has been generally obscured both in current news accounts during each war and in historical accounts written later on.** The obscuring of key information of this type is a symptom of Rockefeller power expansion into the realms of journalism and teaching. **Power is always most secure when it is not recognized, so every effort is made to keep information about it from becoming public.** In a related vein, Rockefeller-style \"public relations\" has been developed and refined since the turn of the century for similarly deceptive purposes. It began when John D. Rockefeller, Sr., famous primarily for his greed, started changing his image by handing out dimes to people he chanced to meet on the street. At the same time he also began making donations to charitable causes, always with great fanfare and publicity, to curry public favor as an alleged philanthropist. **This led to the creation of tax-exempt foundations: these enabled Rockefeller money to be invested in organizations which looked philanthropic, yet which were actually avenues for further expanding Rockefeller power.** The Rockefeller-controlled major foundations have been used to transform American life and values in directions which make America more susceptible to Rockefeller control. At the same time, the foundations serve an invaluable purpose as a disguised means for interlocking the various business interests which constitute the Rockefeller Cartel. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., founded a true dynasty, passing on his plans and programs to be carried on by succeeding generations. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., carried forward the Rockefeller program of ever-expanding power with particular emphasis upon subverting the Christian faith which, historically, is the foundation of basic American ideals. But it was the Rockefeller \"Third Generation\" who expanded and developed the Rockefeller Cartel to its zenith of power.

But it was the Rockefeller \"Third Generation\" who expanded and developed the Rockefeller Cartel to its zenith of power. Of the six members of the Third Generation, sister Abby and brother Winthrop did not much care for the grand plan (although Winthrop did become Governor of Arkansas). But the other four brothers - John D. 3rd, Nelson, Laurance and David - threw themselves with crafty zest into the project of expanding the Rockefeller empire. They carved up the world into spheres of influence, each concentrating upon his own areas but coordinating his actions with the others. They worked together as a unit, and throughout his AUDIO LETTER tapes Dr. Beter often refers to them simply as \"the four Rockefeller brothers.\" ** From about World War II onward, it was the four Rockefeller brothers who held the reins of what had become the worldwide Rockefeller Empire. It was they who created the modern multinational corporation, and used American taxpayer money under the guise of \"foreign aid\" after World War Il to build up their corporate empire worldwide. ** **World War II had been fought over Saudi Arabian oil, and it gave them an unprecedented financial windfall. The Rockefeller oil companies obtained Saudi oil at a net cost (after charge-backs and various devices) of about 5 cents per barrel for nearly 30 years, until the Arab oil embargo of 1973 finally put a halt to it.** The awesome profits generated by Saudi Arabian oil enabled the Rockefeller brothers to buy up much of the industrial base of the United States, Europe and Japan. At the same time Rockefeller power throughout Latin America, which had been established by Nelson Rockefeller during World War II, was expanded and deepened during the postwar years. John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, masterminded the Rockefeller Cartel economic takeover of much of black Africa: revolutions created black governments which, lacking expertise, had to turn to Rockefeller multinational corporations to \"manage\" their resources. Laurance Rockefeller busied himself with control of America's aerospace and defense industry, major airlines, and massaging the stock market. David, the youngest but most powerful, became the kingpin of the Rockefeller banking empire whose tentacles reach into business circles the world over. He also specialized in intelligence matters, although Nelson also was involved in this area. For decades the four Rockefeller brothers had things pretty much their own way. They made plans, set up timetables, and generally carried them out without a hitch.

But by the time Dr. Beter launched his AUDIO LETTER tape report series, the Rockefeller brothers were beginning to show signs of slippage in their power. They had made mistakes, and some of their timetables were starting to slide. During 1974-75 they were tripped up in certain plans by partial public exposure of massive irregularities surrounding America's monetary gold supply. Next **during 1976-77 their long-standing secret alliance with the Kremlin fell apart, as their former allies - the Bolsheviks - were overthrown by a new ruling group in Russia. ** **The four Rockefeller brothers made the mistake of welcoming expelled Bolsheviks from Russia into positions of power here in the United States. This led by early 1979 to the overthrow of the four Rockefeller brothers by the Bolsheviks here**. First John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, died in an alleged auto \"accident\" in July 1978. Then in late January 1979, Nelson Rockefeller was murdered in the beginning of a full-fledged Bolshevik coup d'etat behind the scenes. Today the Rockefeller Cartel is no longer under the direct control of the Rockefeller family as it was under the four Rockefeller brothers, but it remains a formidable force. As Dr. Beter ended his AUDIO LETTER report series in November 1982, the regrouped Rockefeller Cartel was gradually regaining some of its lost power in a bitter struggle against the Bolsheviks here. **The Bolshevik-Zionist Axis** In 1917, during the height of World War I, two events took place which were destined to shape much of the history of the Twentieth Century. One was the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The other was the Balfour Declaration, by which the government of Britain threw its support behind the concept of creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine. **Both Bolshevism and the political force known as Zionism have common roots which are not widely known. Both were created by the Rothschild interests, whose support was also responsible for the meteoric rise to riches of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., a century ago.** Bolshevism and Zionism also have common historical roots in the so-called \"Kingdom of the Jews\" of a thousand years ago. This kingdom was situated in what is now southern Russia, between the Black and Caspian Seas. It consisted of a people known as the Khazars of a Mongol-Turkic origin whose leader officially adopted Judaism as the state religion. This was done as a political ploy to enable Khazaria to maintain its political independence of two powerful neighbors. These were the super-powers of that day: the Moslem empire of the Caliphs to the South and the Christian empire of Byzantium", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:8:8954106e220f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8992, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ago.

This was done as a political ploy to enable Khazaria to maintain its political independence of two powerful neighbors. These were the super-powers of that day: the Moslem empire of the Caliphs to the South and the Christian empire of Byzantium to the west. Prior to the official adoption of Judaism, the Khazars were a brutal and warlike people. This did not change when they took upon themselves the politically inspired title of \"Jews.\" The Khazar empire extended far northward into what, under Christian Prince Vladimir, became known as Russia. The Khazar empire even included the ancient Russian city of Kiev, where Vladimir ruled. Khazar rule was brutal and oppressive, without any of the compensating advantages offered by other empires, such as protection against outside powers or improved civilization. Finally the Christian forces of Prince Vladimir's Russia and Byzantium combined to attack the Khazar \"Kingdom of the Jews\", so-called, and utterly destroy it. The Khazar \"Jews\" were driven out of their homeland between the seas, many of them into eastern Europe. There they mingled to some extent with Jews of the diaspora from Palestine, but they carried with them a peculiar heritage. It was a heritage of bitter hatred for Christianity in general and for Russian Christians in particular. **Down through the centuries, the \"Khazar Jew\" dream of regaining their lost empire has been passed down from generation to generation. This dream has developed into two branches. One branch emphasizes restoration of power over Russia, and crystallized into Bolshevism. The other branch, emphasizing the old, falsely religious \"Kingdom of the Jews\" concept, emerged as the political force known as Zionism. ** Both are aimed at world power. Both are equally ruthless, devoid of regard for human life. They differ only in geographic emphasis and in some tactics. With their common roots and common basic objectives, the Bolsheviks and Zionists work together hand in glove. **When Bolshevism was injected into Christian Russia in 1917, it was done with the help of the Rockefeller Cartel. From that time onward there was a covert alliance between those who controlled American policies behind the scenes (the Rockefeller Cartel) and those who ran the Soviet Union (the Bolsheviks).** The Rockefeller Standard Oil interests were given control over marketing of the oil from the giant Russian Baku oil fields in 1926. Over the years, the Rockefeller Cartel saw to it that the Bolshevik regime in Russia was propped up in every way necessary to keep it in power. **While the United States and the Soviet Union pretended to be at odds, they actually were involved in a pincers movement to gobble up the entire world.** **The falsified", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:9:9366e413d637", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8993, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "(the Bolsheviks).** The Rockefeller Standard Oil interests were given control over marketing of the oil from the giant Russian Baku oil fields in 1926.

Meanwhile the long-term goal was - in the words of a secret White House directive - \"to so alter life in the United States that it can be comfortably merged with life in the Soviet Union.\" In this way, an all-powerful \"one world\" government would ultimately be achieved. That was to be the fulfillment of a \"commitment\" established early in the Twentieth Century by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and allied foundations in the Rockefeller orbit. In order to \"merge\" American life into the pattern of Soviet life under the Bolsheviks, it was clear that the quality of American life would have to be lowered a great deal. It required subtle movement of the American political system in the direction of dictatorship. It required weakening of America's financial and monetary system. And to bring about the radical changes desired, it meant wars with the United States carefully maneuvered into a losing position. America's first no-win war was the Korean War. A decade later, America became embroiled in the losing Vietnam War, which was artificially dragged out with all possibilities for military victory vetoed by the White House. The final war was to be a carefully programmed \"Nuclear War I\", fought primarily on American soil, between the United States and the Soviet Union. Plans called for it to erupt in the late 1970's, but developments in Russia changed that. **The Bolsheviks who had run the Kremlin since 1917 were the targets of a decades-long overthrow campaign by a tough sect of native Russian Christians.** Their power had begun to outweigh that of the Bolsheviks in certain areas starting in 1953, when Stalin died. This was the reason for Nikita Khruschev's famous \"de-Stalinization\" campaign afterward. In the mid-1970's this anti-Bolshevik sect finally reached such a level of power that they completely overthrew and expelled the remaining Bolsheviks in the Kremlin.

There followed a heavy wave of expulsions of Bolsheviks from positions of power in Russia, which was depicted in the Western press as emigration. As the Bolsheviks were losing their grip on Russia, so-called detente fell on hard times. The Rockefeller-Soviet alliance had been based on Bolshevik control on the Soviet side, and when that was terminated, so was the secret alliance. The alliance was fractured by the still-secret Underwater Missile Crisis of 1976; a year later it was broken completely by the equally secret Battle of the Harvest Moon in space. At that point **the four Rockefeller brothers made a fatal mistake. Since their former secret allies in the Soviet Union had been the Bolsheviks, they welcomed the expelled Bolsheviks from Russia into positions of power here in the United States. **They reasoned that the expelled Bolsheviks would know the weak spots of the upstart new group who had taken over the Kremlin and could help the Rockefeller Cartel deal with them. What the Rockefeller brothers forgot is that the Bolsheviks are incapable of sharing power with anyone. Worse yet, the Bolsheviks are state socialists, who seek to concentrate all power into the hands of a few (themselves) by way of government. The Rockefeller Cartel, by contrast, represents corporate socialism - the concentration of power into the hands of a few by way of corporations, with minimum governmental interference. Both seek the same goal, but by means which are diametrically opposed. They cannot coexist within the same society. **The Bolsheviks no sooner acquired positions of power here in the United States than they began using it to topple the four Rockefeller brothers.** By mid-1978, Bolshevik influence within the Pentagon was causing a radical shift of American strategic policy onto a first-strike nuclear posture. Meanwhile in July 1978, the death of John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, took place, weakening what had been the four-brother unit. In November 1978 the Guyana Massacre took place, as part of a military operation masterminded by the Pentagon Bolsheviks and with crucial participation by Israeli commandoes. Then in January 1979, the all-out Bolshevik grab for power began with the murder of Nelson Rockefeller. During the first few months of 1979, Rockefeller power over the United States Government was shattered by the Bolsheviks here. However, **the Bolsheviks were stopped short of complete success in their takeover bid by the intervention of Russia's KGB.

A fierce power struggle is underway within the United States Government between the now entrenched Bolsheviks and the Rockefeller Cartel, which is trying to take back its former power. In addition, a limited new quid pro quo against the Bolsheviks was established by the Rockefeller Cartel and the New Kremlin early in 1982. The Cartel and the Kremlin still have some accounts to settle with each other, but both are deadly enemies of the Bolsheviks. To destroy them, they have agreed to work together in certain ways. ** The Bolsheviks here in the United States have as a major goal a deliberate nuclear war by which to smash the Russia which overthrew them. As an avenue toward that war, the Middle East is critical. In that area, the Bolsheviks here are relying upon their close allies, the Zionists, to pave the way for war.** ** Just as most Americans are unaware of the Bolshevized nature of their government, most Israeli citizens are unaware of the true goals of their Zionist government. Americans and Israelis alike scratch their heads with worry and puzzlement over actions of their respective governments. While constantly talking peace, both are systematically increasing the dangers of war.** The radical Zionist regime in power in Israel from 1977 onward is headed by men who were terrorists in the 1940's. Today, as heads of the world's third most powerful military power, they continue to practice terrorism but on a grander scale. Theirs is a doctrine of military terrorism, designed to lead deliberately to new and wider conflicts as the map of Israel grows steadily. The country which calls itself \"Israel\" today bears little resemblance to the promises of the small but vocal Zionist minority who brought about the Balfour Declaration in 1917. The peaceful, tranquil haven for oppressed Jews does not exist. Instead, the dire warnings published in 1919 by a galaxy of prominent anti-Zionist American Jews have been fulfilled in the bloody history of Zionist Israel. **The New Kremlin Rulers** Dr. Beter first revealed in late 1977 that a new, non-Bolshevik ruling group had taken the reins of top power in the Soviet Union.

In the autumn of 1978, he devoted a complete AUDIO LETTER tape (#38) to a special report on Russia and her new rulers. To those who depend upon pronouncements of the United States Government for their image of Russia, Dr. Beter's reports about the New Kremlin tend to come as a distinct shock. **Unlike the atheistic Bolsheviks recently overthrown, Russia's new top rulers are members of a sect of native Russian Christians. **This sect is at least two centuries old, and at times had considerable influence with the Czars. Dr. Beter cautions his listeners not to assume that the New Kremlin rulers look at everything in the same way as Western Christians might. For one thing, he points out that it required a patient, arduous campaign of six decades for them to oust the Bolsheviks from top power in Russia. That experience has left them with very definite, vivid opinions about what does and does not work when dealing with people like the Bolsheviks and Zionists. They also know that rapid, radical change of any type opens the door for revolution - and where there is revolution, Bolshevik-Zionist agents will be there to exploit it. They are introducing liberalizing changes in Russia gradually, one step at a time. Having come this far, they are trying not to move too fast and thereby risk allowing it all to be undone. Even so, visible changes are occurring. Early in 1979 the first legal shipment of Bibles into Russia since the Bolshevik Revolution took place. That Easter, Handel's Messiah was performed in Russia for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution - and not in some out-of-the-way place, but at the Moscow Conservatory. Churches are reopening, one by one, all over the Soviet Union - and they are packed, as Dr. Billy Graham told the world upon returning from a Moscow religious conference in May 1982. For saying what he did about what he had seen of religion in Russia, Dr. Graham ran into a hostile reception here in the United States. The Bolsheviks who now dominate the United States Government are doing everything in their power to paint Russia as an enemy worthy of hate. Anything which interferes with that image is suppressed. Because someday, the Bolsheviks here want America to go to war against Russia. **Economics: Manmade Causes of Worldwide Economic Disaster** Centuries ago Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild Dynasty, said: \"Give me the power to issue a nation's money, and I care not who writes the laws.\" Money is a necessary ingredient in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:13:42a3d89d5628", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8997, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "United States Government are doing everything in their power to paint Russia as an enemy worthy of hate.

Because someday, the Bolsheviks here want America to go to war against Russia. **Economics: Manmade Causes of Worldwide Economic Disaster** Centuries ago Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild Dynasty, said: \"Give me the power to issue a nation's money, and I care not who writes the laws.\" Money is a necessary ingredient in the advancement of civilization itself. As a store of value and a medium of exchange, money is vastly more convenient and flexible than any system of barter, which is the only alternative. Money facilitates division of labor, specialization by individuals according to their talents, and organization of human activity into complex patterns necessary for advancement in virtually all realms of endeavor. It even helps to make possible economies of scale and other efficiencies which raise human productivity far beyond the levels required for mere survival. This makes it possible for a society to support artistic and other cultural advancements by which a civilization becomes more refined and rich. In short, money is the economic glue which holds a society together. **If it is honest, stable and unmanipulated, money plays a neutral role which is equally beneficial to all members of society.** By working hard, for example, a person may earn more than is needed immediately to pay for whatever he buys from others. The excess can be saved, then spent whenever desired to meet an extraordinary expense, buy something special, or retire from work and live off the fruits of past labor. Money earned reflects work which is valued by society and for which one is paid. ** It is this role of money as the economic common denominator of society that makes it such a tool of immense power in the wrong hands. He who issues a nation's money can create out of thin air what all the rest of us have to earn by honest labor. The issuer of money thus acquires unparalleled power over other individuals, since at the stroke of a pen he can make others wealthy who cooperate in advancing his fraudulent schemes. ** In any society there are always more than enough individuals available who are eager to be comfortably corrupted in this way, and it is they who are helped into positions of governmental power. That is what Rothschild meant when he said, \"I care not who writes the laws.\" The power to issue money is the power to shape government to one's own ends. If one has the power to issue a nation's money, then he also has the power to change its value. This changes the yardstick by which every single economic transaction in a society is measured, and is a way to steal from an entire society at once.

This changes the yardstick by which every single economic transaction in a society is measured, and is a way to steal from an entire society at once. He who sets aside the excess fruits of his labor in the form of money is robbed if, when he is ready to use it later, it is no longer worth the same amount. That is happening today in the United States, of course; it is called inflation. **By the time of the American Revolution, Rothschild financial power in Europe, and especially in Britain, was great.** The Stamp Tax and other oppressive measures which helped trigger the Revolution bore the signature of King George, but they originated in the House of Rothschild. The Revolution broke the former colonies free of Rothschild money control. **The framers of the United States Constitution well understood the evils of corrupt, privately issued money. Therefore they refused to countenance the creation of any type of privately owned central bank. Instead, they gave the United States Congress the constitutional duty to issue and regulate the nation's money**. The theory was that since Congress represents all the people, congressional control of our money should be the fairest and most equitable system possible. From then until the early Twentieth Century, there were repeated attempts by the Rothschild interests to re-establish their lost money power here, either directly or indirectly. One example was the Bank of the United States, whose charter was cancelled by President Andrew Jackson in 1832. Likewise the Civil War involved, not just questions of slavery and states' rights, but also a strong component of struggle over the issuance of money. But once again the attempt failed, thanks partly to intervention by the Russian Navy at a critical tide in the war to prevent Britain and France from dismembering the war-torn United States. For doing that, Russia was slated for destruction by the Rothschild interests. **It was also decided that the best way to regain control over America's money was from within. To that end the Rothschilds lent support to several promising groups within the United States, spawning the era of the \"robber barons.\" Out of that group, the Rockefellers soon rose to the top. ** **In 1913 the Rothschilds finally saw the creation of what they had sought here in the United States: a privately owned central banking system, called the Federal Reserve System.** It was a joint venture involving very heavy participation - in fact a lead role - by the increasingly powerful Rockefeller interests.

But at least the Rothschilds at last had their foot back in the door for control of America's currency. In 1917 the Rothschilds accomplished their other goal, the destruction of Christian Russia, by way of the Bolshevik Revolution. As in the case of the Federal Reserve System, the basic concept was Rothschild-inspired ... but it was Rockefeller muscle that made the plan a success. Having started out as Rothschild proteges, the Rockefeller Cartel had risen already to the status of partners. And during the decades that followed - especially after World War II - the Rockefellers pulled ahead and eclipsed Rothschild power on the world stage. That situation continued until the end of the 1970's. Now, with the collapse of the family Rockefeller Dynasty, the balance between the Rockefeller and Rothschild factions is in a state of flux, with both struggling for renewed supremacy. ** The Federal Reserve System was sold to the public as a prescription for improved economic stability. But the record shows that the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression were brought about in large part by deliberate Federal Reserve actions. ** The Great Bull Market of the 1920's was set in motion and sustained for most of a decade by means of easy credit. By 1929 the towering stock market was resting upon a huge, wobbly foundation of credit - that is, debt. The Federal Reserve Board then destroyed that foundation over a matter of mere months by severely contracting credit. The excuse given was designed to sound good, namely a crackdown on harmful speculation. But the real and predictable effect was to cause masses of investors to be suddenly unable to cover their \"margin\" stock-market purchases, forcing them to sell stock to raise cash. The sell-off thus triggered fed upon itself, while the Federal Reserve Board did nothing to halt the plunge. The stock market crashed. Having set economic disaster in motion, the Federal Reserve Board soon thereafter made sure that it would mushroom into an all-out depression. This was brought about, not by the stock market crash itself, but by the failure of the American banking system afterward. A key purpose of the Federal Reserve System is supposed to be the preservation of banking stability, by stepping in as the lender of last resort (among other things) to prevent a localized banking problem from spreading. **But in the early 1930's, a then-major bank - the United States Bank of New", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:16:7b698645359e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9000, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "it would mushroom into an all-out depression.

This created a chain reaction which pulled down additional banks**, which dragged down still others, and so on. The Federal Reserve System, far from stopping this process, had set it in motion and did not intervene as it progressed. This plunged America and then the entire world into the Great Depression of the 1930's. To most people a depression is an unmitigated disaster. It is hard to imagine that anyone could benefit from it, much less bring it about deliberately. But** for the money controllers and their wealthy allies, the Great Depression provided enormous opportunities for increased wealth and power.** Knowing what was coming, they were able to avoid the crushing financial losses which befell everyone else. Then during the depths of the Depression, they were in a position to buy up companies, real estate and other assets at a penny on the dollar. When the economy revived later on, these assets regained their value, producing vast profits for their new owners. Ironically, by using their money control to plunge the American economy into disaster, the moneychangers set the stage for still greater expansion of their authority over America's monetary system. **When President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, he launched a series of sweeping moves that began with the declaration of a bank holiday. The United States was taken off the gold standard. Americans were required to turn in all of their gold coins. Title to America's gold was then handed over - as a gift! - to the Federal Reserve System.** However, the Federal Reserve System was relieved of any need to spend time and money to take care of the gold which it now owned, as the U.S. Treasury Department was made physical custodian of the gold. The Federal Reserve System became freer than ever to tinker with America's economy by printing paper and controlling credit. The freedom grew steadily over the years as gold backing for the dollar was decreased. In 1968 President Johnson signed into law an act removing the final 25% gold backing requirement from the dollar. In 1971 President Nixon closed the international gold window, discontinuing settlement of international debts in gold. This left the United States dollar purely a piece of paper, totally divorced from gold or anything else of intrinsic value.

This left the United States dollar purely a piece of paper, totally divorced from gold or anything else of intrinsic value. This is an ideal situation for the money controllers, made to order for manipulation to enrich themselves at everyone else's expense. Since the dollar has been a worldwide reserve currency since 1944, this means that everyone on earth is victimized by the dollar manipulation now underway in the U.S. From 1971 onward, inflation has been an ever-increasing problem in the United States and therefore worldwide. Each time it is damped down temporarily, it is slowed at the expense of rising unemployment and slumping economic activity. When the economy revives, inflation soon takes off again to new and higher levels. The Federal Reserve Board, claiming (as in 1929) to be looking out for our best interests, responds with crushing new interest rates that reach new historical highs. Again unemployment shoots up, without ever having quite recovered from the previous cycle. Cycle after cycle, inflation and economic stagnation both keep getting worse. The balance between the two conditions keeps shifting back and forth, but both inflation and stagnation are with us continually and simultaneously. We are caught in the \"stagflation\" era foreseen by Dr. Beter in his 1973 book, *The Conspiracy Against the Dollar*. The crumbling of the once powerful United States economy is a direct consequence, and an intended one, of the destruction of the dollar itself which is underway. The time will come when the dollar will collapse altogether, and with it the economy of the United States and much of the world as we know it. At that point the same thing will have to be done that has always been done when other currencies have collapsed. There will have to be a new currency - a new dollar - with something behind it to restore confidence. The one commodity which has been a reliable, universally accepted basis for monetary confidence for thousands of years is gold. And so, gold will have to be used in setting up a new system of stable international currencies, including a new dollar. Meanwhile **there will come a period of international monetary turbulence during which only gold or strongly gold-backed currencies will be trusted.** During that period of time, assets measured in dollars will shrivel - as they are already doing now, at a less frantic pace. Those who have cornered the world's gold supply will be in a perfect position to vastly expand their own holdings and power.

Those who have cornered the world's gold supply will be in a perfect position to vastly expand their own holdings and power. And so, contrary to the official books of the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System, America's monetary gold hoard has been largely spirited away. It began in 1961 under the London Gold Pool Agreement: for seven years enormous loads of American monetary gold were hemorrhaged out of Fort Knox and other depositories and sent overseas. In addition there have been secret shipments of gold which are not reflected in official records at all. Through their control and manipulation of money - specifically the United States dollar - the moneychangers are stealing vast amounts of what countless millions have worked hard to produce. And just as they did in 1929 and afterward, they are again positioning themselves to set off economic disaster worldwide. **Military: The Secret Plans and Weapons for Armageddon** To most people war is a supreme evil among human events, to be avoided if at all possible ... and yet, we go right on having wars. To those who rule nations, war is a tool of power which is used deliberately. War can be used for external reasons, such as to increase the geographical extent of a nation's power. More importantly, **war provides the perfect excuse for a government to impose increased controls on its own people. By citing \"national security\" the government can persuade the people that even highly dictatorial controls are for their own good.** These principles are among those laid out centuries ago by Machiavelli, who recommended to all rulers that they use wars regularly as a tool of power. But early in the Twentieth Century, the Carnegie, Rockefeller and allied interests of the day dreamed of a world in which their power would be absolute, and permanently assured. It would be a world at \"peace\" - the peace of a world inescapably within their grip. They formed a \"commitment\" to establish an eventual \"one world\" government. A leading institution which was created to coordinate this one-world \"commitment\" was a tax-exempt foundation: the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In order to bring about the envisioned \"peace\" of a one-world government, it was clear that vast changes would have to be wrought in the lives of Americans, as well as of the other peoples of the world. Several years before World War I the trustees spent an entire year debating the question: \"Is there any means known to man that is more effective than war in changing the life of an", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:19:55552f52b7a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9003, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "tax-exempt foundation: the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Several years before World War I the trustees spent an entire year debating the question: \"Is there any means known to man that is more effective than war in changing the life of an entire nation?\" They concluded that the answer was: \"No.\" And so, to start bringing about the changes needed under the long-range commitment for a one-world government, somehow America had to be gotten into war. The trustees debated how this could be done and concluded that it would be necessary to control the foreign policy machinery of the United States. That implied, in turn, that control had to be established over the State Department. Within a few years the fruits of these deliberations began to be seen in U.S. actions. **President Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on the theme, \"He kept us out of war\", and then promptly took the United States into World War I. **On at least one occasion the trustees of the Carnegie Endowment sent a telegram to Wilson urging him not to let American involvement in the war end too soon. The changes in American life which they desired were beginning to take place. World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War all were orchestrated in ways designed to serve the purposes of the long-range one-world commitment. But during the decades beginning with World War II, a factor unforeseen by the initiators of the one-world commitment grew steadily in importance. This factor was the ever-accelerating advancement of weapons technology. **Starting with the atomic bomb, weaponry has advanced in ways not dreamed of in the early years of the Twentieth Century. And these new technological capabilities have played a role in the progressive collapse of the one-world commitment as originally envisioned.** In 1960 American scientists invented the laser - a device which produces an intense, narrow beam of light. Early lasers were crude and not very powerful, yet it was clear from theoretical studies that someday laser beam weapons would be possible. Other types of beam weapons were also foreseen which were potentially even more devastating than lasers. Suddenly there was a fatal flaw in the \"one world\" commitment. The flaw was that it envisioned only one world - the Earth - as the entire arena of human activity. That was beginning to change ... because mankind was beginning the conquest of space. In 1957, three years before the invention of the laser, the world's first manmade earth satellite had been orbited by the Soviet Union - Sputnik I.

The honor of being the first nation in history to do this had been handed to the Soviet Union, even though the United States had been technically capable of doing it first. The Soviet space program was far ahead of that of the United States when, in 1960, the invention of the laser suddenly added an urgent new dimension to the space race. The beam from a laser or other beam weapon can travel through space at the speed of light to strike a target a million miles away within a matter of seconds. **Suddenly the moon had become a prize piece of military real estate: whoever controlled the moon could someday use it as a base for beam weapons to control the Earth.** In 1961 the four Rockefeller brothers inaugurated an elaborate, two-pronged program for world domination, with seizure of the moon as its centerpiece. On one hand, the United States would embark on a program of supposed disarmament, whittling back the power of America's visible military forces. But on the other hand, there would be increased emphasis upon development of advanced new secret weapons, unknown to the public and largely unknown even to Congress. And under the guise of a great adventure, **the moon would be seized for unadmitted military purposes by way of the Apollo Project.** The four Rockefeller brothers had in mind an eventual double-cross of their secret ally, the Soviet Union, in the programmed nuclear war to come. By seizing control of the moon and installing devastating beam weapons there, they expected to emerge as the final, absolute rulers of the entire world. In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced that the United States would land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. Thus began a crash program ten times bigger than the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. It was too big to hide, so instead its military nature was disguised by a constant glare of publicity to portray it all as a lark to pick up some moon rocks. And it succeeded. When Neil Armstrong planted man's first footprints on the moon in July 1969, it was a sensational event the world over. Little more than three years later, however, it was becoming routine enough in the public eye for America's manned moon program to be removed from public view.

The final publicly admitted moon flight was Apollo 17 in December 1972. Thereafter, as the American public became increasingly absorbed in the Watergate Scandal and other matters, the U.S. moon program continued secretly from a new base: the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Different launch techniques were used there, involving the Skylab space station as a way station to the moon. While all of this was going on, unexpected developments were brewing in the Soviet Union: a progressive overthrow of the Bolsheviks was steadily accelerating. By the mid-1960's the emerging new Kremlin rulers had learned about the planned Rockefeller double-cross in a programmed nuclear war to come. They redoubled their efforts to complete their overthrow of the Bolsheviks. They also began preparing to beat the Rockefeller brothers to the punch with their own double-cross. By the mid-1970's, present-day trustees of the major Rockefeller tax-exempt foundations were growing increasingly worried. Signs were multiplying that the one-world commitment formed two generations earlier had jumped the tracks. They were right. In the summer of 1976 Dr. Beter reported on a major crisis which, to this day, has never been made public officially. This was the Underwater Missile Crisis, in which the Soviet Navy was planting small underwater-launch, short-range missiles with nuclear warheads inside American territorial waters. These were planted close to their targets, able to be fired at a moment's notice by satellite command. If fired, they would destroy coastal target areas with essentially zero warning time - the perfect \"first strike.\" They were planted by means of small sonar-absorbing, super-quiet minisubmarines, designed to move in and out of American territorial waters without being detected by coastal sonar defense nets. ** The limited exposure of this crisis by way of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER reports enabled the late General George S. Brown, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to take action. Over protests by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, General Brown persuaded President Gerald Ford to give him the go-ahead to order the U.S. Navy to remove the missiles. ** In September 1976 Dr. Beter and an associate met with General Brown in his Pentagon office to discuss the crisis. In that meeting, Dr. Beter provided General Brown with the locations of a second round of Soviet underwater missiles. This was information General Brown did not have, thanks to an \"intelligence gap\" created by Kissinger in context with the former Rockefeller-Soviet alliance.

This was information General Brown did not have, thanks to an \"intelligence gap\" created by Kissinger in context with the former Rockefeller-Soviet alliance. Exposure of the Soviet missile-planting program took away the crucial element of surprise and helped to avert war at that time. Even so, General Brown was soon neutralized as part of a hopeless Rockefeller attempt to restore the former Rockefeller-Soviet alliance, and many Soviet missiles were never removed from American waters. As the immediate crisis over the Soviet underwater missiles died down, Dr. Beter learned that other missiles also were planted under the sea. These had been planted earlier and were not Soviet, but American. In violation of international treaties, the United States had planted mammoth multi-warhead missiles on the ocean floor in the Atlantic and Pacific, targeted on the Soviet Union. The new Kremlin rulers bided their time, allowing the four Rockefeller brothers to convince themselves that they were succeeding in patching up the former alliance. But they were routing the Bolsheviks out of the Kremlin and out of many other high-level positions of power in Russia. At the same time they were finalizing preparations for a surprise many times more decisive than that of the Underwater Missile Crisis. ** As the autumn of 1977 approached, American beam weapons were nearing operational status at a secret military base nestled in Copernicus Crater on the moon. But on the night of the Harvest Moon, September 27, 1977, the base was attacked and put out of action by the Soviet Union. ** For ten years the Russians had been involved in a crash program to develop a family of particle beam weapons, which fire subatomic particles at a target at virtually the speed of light. A neutron beam weapon, fired from an orbiting, manned satellite, killed all the astronauts at the American moon base. (The Russian satellite was partially disabled during the encounter. This was the nuclear-powered satellite, Cosmos 954, which four months later created a worldwide sensation by coming to earth in northern Canada. It was not a crash, but an emergency landing.) **The silencing of the secret U.S. moon base was the beginning of a lightning military takeover of space by the Soviet Union.** During the final months of 1977, the Soviet Union deployed a secret program of manned strategic weapons, to which the United States has no counterpart. First came the \"cosmos interceptor\" killer satellites, which use particle beam weapons to blast other satellites out of existence. These started hunting down and destroying American spy and early-warning satellites, one by one.

First came the \"cosmos interceptor\" killer satellites, which use particle beam weapons to blast other satellites out of existence. These started hunting down and destroying American spy and early-warning satellites, one by one. Within about six months - by the spring of 1978 - they completed the job. Meanwhile Russia's new rulers were demanding that the United States begin laying down its arms by way of SALT II or risk unspecified dire consequences. These circumstances led to a desperate intelligence mission in April 1978, in which a Korean airliner flew into the most sensitive military airspace in the Soviet Union. Russian jet fighters forced the airliner down, but only after special equipment mounted in the plane radioed vital data on the Soviet military alert status to CIA receivers. In addition to spy satellites, a Russian cosmos interceptor also destroyed the Skylab space station in mid-October, 1977, in order to block any American attempt to return to the moon. Skylab died in a giant fireball seen over much of the United States on October 18, 1977. NASA waited a week or so for all the puzzled questions over the mystery giant fireball to die away and then began a lengthy coverup project, saying Skylab was sinking unexpectedly from orbit. This hoax was followed from start to finish in the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER report series. It is not practical to review all of the developments reported by Dr. Beter in this \"Bird's-Eye View\" section. Instead, the basic situation can be illustrated by considering just two weapons programs: the MX missile and the \"stealth\" aircraft program. The official justifications for these programs are always couched in terms of Russian weapons which everyone knows about - primarily Russia's large missiles. These explanations never quite add up, because they are not the truth. As a result controversy and questions keep swirling around these programs. As old rationales fray and fall apart, new ones are devised which also don't quite add up. Only when the truth about Russia's secret programs is known do the American weapons programs make sense. Not pleasant sense, but sense. In June, 1980, Dr. Beter described in detail what the MX program is all about. The big MX missile itself is actually of little importance - but the MX program is being used as an umbrella under which another, completely secret, missile system is being financed and deployed. Dr. Beter reported that the controversy then raging over proposals for a \"racetrack\" mobile basing system for the MX was only a lightning rod to draw attention away from deployment of America's real mobile missile. This is a much smaller missile,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:24:94701786e92a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9008, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "the MX program is all about. The big MX missile itself is actually of little importance - but the MX program is being used as an umbrella under which another, completely secret, missile system is being financed and deployed. Dr. Beter reported that the controversy then raging over proposals for a \"racetrack\" mobile basing system for the MX was only a lightning rod to draw attention away from deployment of America's real mobile missile. This is a much smaller missile, called the Minuteman TX. It was developed virtually from off-the-shelf hardware, and is deployed on America's railroads aboard special rail cars. Dr. Beter described these unique rail cars, and later several listeners spotted them and took photographs which were published in a special bulletin for AUDIO LETTER listeners. In October, 1981, President Reagan shocked a lot of people by announcing that the MX missile would not be made mobile after all. The ridiculous \"racetrack\" scheme had served its purpose, which was deception, and was dropped. The controversy has continued, but the MX program has remained alive through it all. Early in 1983, after the termination of the AUDIO LETTER report series, the concept of a smaller mobile missile was the key new ingredient in the public recommendations of the Scowcroft Commission on strategic nuclear forces. Supposedly such a small mobile missile, nicknamed \"Midgetman\", could not be deployed until the early 1990's. But in actuality, that type of missile is deployed already ... the Minuteman TX. Its biggest advantage has nothing to do with the alleged first-strike threat of Russian ICBM's. Instead, the deployment of large numbers of small Minuteman TX missiles is intended to make it impossible for Russia's cosmosphere fleet to keep tabs on them all. And as Dr. Beter detailed over the course of several AUDIO LETTER reports, the mobile fleet of Minuteman TX missiles are not designed merely to survive a Soviet nuclear first strike. Instead, the Pentagon Bolsheviks intend to use them as the key to an eventual U.S. first strike against Russia. ** The other example to consider is the \"stealth\" program. This is a multi-faceted program, which actually involves not only aircraft but also a highly secret category of naval warships with their own special bases. Shortly after Dr. Beter reported on the existence of these special bases in the spring of 1982, they spawned naval warfare in the Southern Hemisphere. The visible portion of that conflict was the Falklands War.** Restricting attention to the stealth aircraft program, the most radical and promising development is that of the \"phantom warplane.\" First revealed by Dr. Beter in the spring of 1982, the phantom warplane is as radical an advance in this computer age as the atomic bomb was in an age of adding machines and slide rules.

By using powerful computer techniques, Einstein's semi-finished Unified Field Theory has been used to design superconducting electromagnetic field equipment which can bend light waves. Built into an aircraft, this equipment creates a zone around the aircraft which light cannot penetrate: instead, it flows around and onward, like water around a boulder in a stream. The result is that at a distance the airplane is invisible, not only to radar, but even to the eye. Public comments about the stealth program refer only to radar evasion, not to the far more startling capability of optical invisibility. Once again, this is done in order to limit discussion to a range of weaponry capabilities which will not raise too many public eyebrows. If the full capabilities of the phantom warplane were known, it would raise the question: why is something so radical needed? The answer lies with Russia's still-secret beam weapons. The most important fact about the invisibility field of a phantom warplane is not the invisibility itself, but the protection which the same field provides against all types of beam weapons. **The Bolsheviks who now control the United States Pentagon want to use all these weapons to crush the Soviet Union from which they have been overthrown and expelled.** They have devised elaborate plans, detailed in the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER reports, to set off a nuclear first strike by the United States against Russia. Nuclear \"false alarms\", so-called, have been staged in order to test their ability to trigger what will look afterward like accidental nuclear war. American nuclear forces will be led to believe that they are retaliating, instead of striking first. The United States remains locked out of any large-scale, sustained military presence in space. Even so, a few key reconnaissance and other military tasks must be carried out in space in order to prepare for war. For that purpose the Space Shuttle is being used in ways hidden from public view. The NASA Space Shuttle program is nominally civilian, but after the first Space Shuttle launch the civilian director of the program was eased out. Today the Shuttle director is Air Force General James Abrahamson. ** It is often said that the world today lives under the threat of a Battle of Armageddon which, for the first time in history, could conceivably live up its apocalyptic description in the Bible.

What is less well known is that certain evil forces are actively planning for such a conflict and trying to bring it about. And they are harnessing the ingenuity of man to create Armageddon-style weapons about which the public is never informed.** **Summary** In surveying the 80 cassette tapes of the AUDIO LETTER report series, a single gigantic picture emerges. The most striking thing about this picture is that **countless seemingly unrelated, chaotic-appearing news events turn out not to be chaotic after all. Instead they are all tied together by a limited number of forces at work behind the scenes. Once one knows these forces, one becomes far better able to sort out the true meaning of events.** ** Three major power groups are struggling today for worldwide influence and power. Like icebergs, they are partially visible but mostly hidden. These groups are (1) the Rockefeller Cartel of big oil, big banking and big business; (2) the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis; and (3) the New Kremlin rulers of Russia.** The relationships among these groups have shifted radically over the past decade or so. The Bolsheviks used to control the Soviet Union, and while they did there was a secret alliance between them and the Rockefeller Cartel. But they have been overthrown and expelled from top levels of power in Russia by the New Kremlin rulers, who are anti-Bolshevik and are, in fact, a secret sect of native Russian Christians. During 1976 and 1977 Russia's new rulers unilaterally terminated the long-time Rockefeller-Soviet alliance, together with its plans for programmed nuclear war on the way to a \"one world\" government. The four Rockefeller brothers, then in control of the Rockefeller Cartel, welcomed the expelled Bolsheviks from Russia into positions of power here in the United States. That was a fatal mistake, which led to the overthrow of the four Rockefeller brothers at Bolshevik hands from mid-1978 to early 1979. Since that time there has been a steadily intensifying power struggle between the Bolsheviks here and the regrouped Rockefeller Cartel for control over the U.S. Government. Generally speaking, the Bolsheviks have been getting their way in military affairs, while the Rockefeller Cartel has greater power in the economic realm. Since early 1982, there has been a limited quid pro quo between the Rockefeller Cartel and the New Kremlin against their common bitter enemy, the Bolsheviks. Meanwhile the strong links between the American Bolsheviks and the Zionist rulers of Israel have been forged into a secret joint military junta - the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis - bent on war. ** Politics, economics, and international", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:behindthescenes.txt:27:95e4c27d0c82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9011, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "behindthescenes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "behindthescenes", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "been getting their way in military affairs, while the Rockefeller Cartel has greater power in the economic realm.

Meanwhile the strong links between the American Bolsheviks and the Zionist rulers of Israel have been forged into a secret joint military junta - the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis - bent on war. ** Politics, economics, and international relations (including war) are constantly used by these world power factions as they struggle with one another. Economic manipulations, covert intelligence maneuvers and a proliferating array of secret weapons are features of this struggle. But as made clear in many of Dr. Beter's tapes, the basic struggle is a spiritual one.** Dr. Beter terminated his AUDIO LETTER report series in November 1982 due to declining health. Events which have taken place since then are beyond the scope of this REFERENCE DIGEST. Even so, peppered throughout the tapes are many discussions of plans and events still in gestation, and knowing those plans can help provide many clues to the meaning of events still to come. Beyond that, the past is always prologue to the future. By studying the many events which ran their course during the seven-odd years of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series, one can learn a great deal about the underlying forces still at work in our world. ** Important Comment Repeated From the Beginning of This Essay:** Though this material was compiled in 1983 and some of Dr. Beter's predictions did not come to pass, many of his key predictions did come true, and the principles and political factions discussed continue to play a key role. You may find some of this information to be quite unbelievable and difficult to verify. Even so, we invite you to consider that the underlying concepts can greatly assist in understanding current developments deep behind the scenes in world politics. **Final Note:** To read or listen to Dr. Beter's audio tapes, see [http://www.peterdavidbeter.com](http://www.peterdavidbeter.com).
