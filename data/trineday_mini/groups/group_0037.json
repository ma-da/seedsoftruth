those effects threaten hives Healthy bees in a frame used for research Credit Judy Wu Smart Wu Smart for her part knows where she stands Death is not an appropriate end point for honeybees she said Environmental Disaster in Nebraska She s seen enough death In 2016 in Mead Neb not far from her lab Wu Smart set up hives with a student in the doctoral program to find out if trees would provide a barrier for bees in specially designed pollinator habitats from potentially toxic dust that was produced by an ethanol plant The plant owned by a now bankrupt company called AltEn converted surplus crop seeds into ethanol The seeds had been treated with pesticides including neonicotinoids The neonicotinoid levels in the vicinity were extremely high recorded at thousands of times the levels considered safe by the EPA In a story by U S Right to Know in 2021 Carey Gillam wrote that the environmental catastrophe attracted nationwide attention and raised questions about why regulators were unable or unwilling to rein in years of questionable activities by the company In another story Gillam wrote that the plant had been contaminating the area for years at unsafe levels In the midst of that disaster during her experiment Wu Smart found that trees did not protect the bees that were nested nearby After repeatedly finding piles of dead bees Wu Smart s team checked the vegetation in the area the liquids and the dust from dust traps The closer to the plant they tested the higher the levels of pesticides I think the dust was immediately causing deaths of the bees that were foraging she said After witnessing such massive losses between two million and three million bees Wu Smart has experienced some catharsis in lobbying the Nebraska Legislature on issues that relate to bee health

bee colonies USDA reports Credit Leopictures via Pixabay American beekeepers and honey producers continued to lose hundreds of thousands of bee colonies each quarter in 2023 according to an annual survey released Thursday by the U S Department of Agriculture From January through March respondents to the federal survey reported that they lost nearly 400 000 colonies in a single quarter That number constitutes 15 percent of the estimated 2 7 million honey bee colonies in the United States During the rest of the year respondents reported that they lost between 250 000 and 380 000 colonies each quarter It s so hard to keep them alive said Chris Hiatt president of the American Honey Producers Association We just expect we re going to lose 40 to 50 percent Despite the substantial losses the estimated number of honey bee colonies remained stable from 2022 to 2023 with the total number of colonies estimated at 2 71 million The totals have remained the same because beekeepers added or renovated colonies throughout the year Hiatt said that because demand for pollination is increasing the number of hives should have increased as well but that beekeeping operations are struggling to maintain the hives they have Financially everyone should have increased their hive numbers by 10 to 20 percent he said Hive numbers should go up On the positive side the reports of symptoms of colony collapse disorder CCD decreased in the first quarter of 2024 Last year in the first quarter that number spiked at more than 107 000 colonies In the first quarter of 2024 by comparison that number fell to 70 650 The disorder is characterized in part by the rapid loss of the adult bee population even if the colony has a queen To qualify as colony collapse disorder the loss of bees cannot be explained by the presence of mites or fungus The dramatic onset of CCD in recent decades spurred headlines and public awareness about the risks to honey bees For the annual honey bee colony survey the National Agricultural Statistical Service surveyed 3 300 beekeeping operations that managed five or more colonies on a quarterly basis The agency did not release data on sampling error In a separate report issued by the Bee Informed Partnership a now defunct nonprofit organization beekeepers reported that they lost 50 percent of their colonies over the course of an entire year from April 2022 to April 2023 The 12 year loss rate reported by the organization which surveyed more than 10 percent of beekeepers nationwide was 40 percent In the USDA survey during January through June the hardest months

They reported that pesticides qualified as stressors in about 10 percent of colonies That means that during those months Varroa mites and other pests may have affected as many as 1 7 million colonies and pesticides may have affected 270 000 colonies according to respondents Beekeepers also reported that they lost nearly 14 percent of colonies during those months because of other factors such as weather starvation insufficient forage queen death and hive damage The numbers from the USDA showed a flurry of activity to keep bee operations going with operators adding hundreds of thousands of colonies 404 000 in the first quarter of 2023 followed by 617 000 in the second quarter 618 000 in the third quarter and 119 000 in the fourth quarter On top of that operators renovated colonies In those cases they added a queen or additional bees to an existing colony Beekeepers reported renovating 216 000 colonies in the first quarter 522 000 colonies in the second quarter 486 000 colonies in the third quarter and 119 000 in the fourth quarter The process is costly Hiatt said with an incredible amount of expensive queens and you re taking away from your strong hives Luckily with bees within a season you can have a strong hive The survey s estimate of 2 7 million colonies in the United States differs substantially from the estimate produced by a separate USDA survey a five year agricultural census In that report the agency estimated that the U S had 3 8 million bee colonies a record number The two federal surveys polled different populations For the one year survey

million colonies from July through March in the last decade We believe this to be an underestimate of these losses Downey said Source USDA As of January 2024 beekeepers maintained 2 7 million honey bee colonies nationwide according to survey data of operations with five or more colonies from the U S Department of Agriculture Preliminary sampling of live and dead bees has failed to show a cause and a team of at least 16 scientists from universities and the USDA are looking for answers The survey from Project Apis m covered whether the bees were stored indoors or outdoors over winter whether queens had been replaced in lost colonies whether beekeepers had supplemented their nutrition and how many colonies were afflicted by Varroa mites For each of these variables Downey said no clear pattern emerged In the next few months government and university researchers will analyze samples for pathogens pesticide residues microbiome and host pathogen interactions as well as metagenomic

for bees and other pollinators While the scientists who were interviewed for this story said that they felt no influence from corporate interests in the selection of papers that were presented at the ESA meeting they were surprised to hear that neonicotinoid research barely made a showing I ve never had a problem getting a neonic paper in a symposium said Vera Krischik a tenure track associate professor at the University of Minnesota who has conducted extensive research into the effects of neonicotinoids on pollinators I m not going to deny that there is an uninterest or a bias to not talk about pesticides and bees she said I don t think it s at the level of the ESA According to the results of a session by session review of the conference s presentations conducted by U S Right to Know the few papers and posters that were dedicated to the effects of neonicotinoids on bees were presented by students not by scholars Only four papers and posters that examined the topic made it into the conference out of nearly 100 papers posters and symposia on bee science In some instances according to attendees scholars engaged in general discussions of neonicotinoids and pollinators on panels that were not dedicated to the presentation of specific papers Top findings of U S Right to Know s review of the papers posters symposia and workshops at the ESA meeting Out of nearly 100 papers and posters presented on bee science in 2023 four specifically related to the role of neonicotinoids in the declining health of bees All four were presented by students By comparison in 2013 scholars presented at least 19 papers on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees at the ESA meeting In 2023 26 percent of the symposia workshops and science policy sessions were organized by employees from the corporate sector in most cases those organizers were employed by agrochemical companies Also in 2023 16 percent of panelists in symposia workshops and science policy discussions were employed by corporations Chris Stelzig the executive director of the ESA did not dispute these findings but in a written response to questions from U S Right to Know he pointed out that in a search on the term

such as resistance to the insecticides among bed bugs and the Colorado potato beetle effects of pesticides on burying beetles and effects of pesticides on restoration prairie plants Stelzig s response noted that the ESA doesn t prescribe specific topics for coverage in its conference program nor do we track the trends in conference presentation subjects in detail For any given subject within entomology what is covered in ESA conference programs reflects the ebb and flow of interest in it among the community and the focus of research being conducted in the field Several entomologists who organized panels in bee science for the conference said that they were surprised to hear that research about the effects of neonicotinoids on bees had all but vanished from the program While many of these scientists said that they believe neonicotinoids should be banned to protect bees they also said that the field has shifted to an approach that accounts for multiple stressors on individual bees and hives rather than studies of individual factors and that the research presented at the conference reflects that way of thinking That approach to research tracks with the point of view of agrochemical companies which have posited for years that the collapse of bee colonies has occurred as a result of multiple factors not just neonicotinoids despite the extensive body of research that shows the harm caused by the products in isolation Bayer has even produced a children s book called Toby and the Bees in which the perils of mites figure prominently without a word about neonicotinoids Here is an excerpt from a fact sheet on bee health and neonicotinoids by Bayer Source Bayer Two hundred thousand square feet dedicated to science The ESA meeting in 2023 brought in more

approximately 3 to 3 5 percent of the society s total annual revenue Based on total revenue for 2023 the society took in between 200 000 and 235 000 through the corporate partnership program that year That funding Stelzig added supports a variety of programs not just the meetings Throughout ESA membership programs and publications the statement said we seek a diversity of scientific expertise professional backgrounds and personal perspectives That diversity ensures a healthy and productive mix of ideas to advance ESA s mission and strengthen entomology as a scientific field and profession The partnership approach which the society adopted in 2017 mostly replaced the traditional sponsorship model in which companies paid for specific receptions and events at meetings This reduced the number of elements of the meeting that were linked to individual sponsors and instead allowed us to recognize groups of partners collectively Stelzig s statement said It also said that ESA s Corporate

on the effects of individual pesticides on pollinators without factoring in the cumulative effects of a range of chemicals After she spoke she said five people from the audience stepped up and fired off highly technical questions such as whether she had completed indexes of cumulative effects Questions came in with Have you done indexes about toxicity They were just getting very technical in

healthy constructive debate is a natural aspect of the exchange of ideas and it is an important part of the scientific process his statement said At ESA conferences our code of conduct fosters civil discourse and prohibits behavior that is threatening or harassing May said that she had expected to face an audience that drew from industry because her talk involved pesticide regulation I knew that it was likely to have an industry audience that it was likely to have pushback she said So I didn t exactly go in unprepared I knew that what I was saying was not palatable to some parts of the audience Even so it s not an experience that she is eager to repeat I really don t enjoy being in that scenario personally I will have to work my nerve back up again to do it again May said She also said that it was easier to get papers on any topic into the conference when she was a graduate student She was not surprised to hear that neonicotinoid research was exclusively presented by students at the 2023 conference On the grad student side of things there s a whole different mix of types of research being presented May said I don t think there s any direction on that side of things I remember when I was in grad school I could submit a talk on anything and participate in the grad student sessions It s a very diverse set of topics Scientists who organize panels and present papers differ over whether research is marginalized when it is presented by students rather than full scholars It should be that way Krischik said You get a grant you put a student under grant and they have to present papers because they need a job So absolutely it should be the students doing the papers On the other hand some researchers view scholarly presentations as carrying more weight In general

ESA symposium selection can be very competitive she said Chakrabarti Basu who is also is also an assistant professor of pollinator health and apiculture at Mississippi State University described the system like this The entomological society develops themes Then based on those themes organizers of symposia and workshops come up with ideas for panels They submit applications and if selected invite scientists to speak at a symposium or panel Specific topics and papers can be selected on several criteria Whether they track with the theme whether they satisfy diversity interests which can include the diversity of both the scientists and their career stages and whether the topic is relevant to the changing world Chakrabarti Basu has never felt that corporate sponsors influenced her work for ESA A lot of these decisions are made higher up she said I ve organized a number of symposia I ve organized a number of workshops Sponsorship had no effect on what I organized She and other scientists noted that the current state of the research into bee colony collapse examines multiple stressors As a result bee science is becoming more interdisciplinary than ever If you look at a bee in the landscape she said that bee is not only facing stress from climate change It is also facing a mite or a disease stress Or pesticides Or poor nutrition So it is actually a lot of different things that

always say There has to be something unique and interesting It can t just be What if they disrupt something because they definitely do They disrupt so many different processes in bees For a lot of us bee scientists she said we already have a verdict They re doing harm and if we care about conserving bee populations we should do what s been done in the UK and other countries where they stopped using them The topics at the 2023 ESA meeting reflect that focus on multiple stressors contributing to the decline of bee colonies In nearly 100 papers posters and symposia on bee science presented by scholars the top topics were Bees thermal tolerance in a warming world with more than 20 panels and papers on the subject Habitats that improve pollinators survival with 19 panels and papers Bee genetics with 14 papers posters and symposia Other general areas of research included foraging social behavior the effects of varroa mites which harm bees development and effective beekeeping practices Globally neonic research and citation rates are increasing While some researchers and symposium organizers at the ESA may be experiencing research fatigue with neonicotinoid studies a recent

to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp According to the company s annual report Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously in the suit brought by beekeepers in Canada Linda J Visser a partner in Siskinds LLP a law firm that is representing beekeepers in Ontario in the case said that the class covers at least 500 beekeepers in Québec and 15 000 beekeepers in Ontario The suit if not settled could go to trial in two to three years There s a lot of research out there thousands of studies supporting the link between neonics and harms to bees Visser said Neonics were introduced in Canada around 2006 she said And shortly thereafter is when honeybee keepers started experiencing larger than normal bee die offs And we saw that in other jurisdictions as well France is probably an early good example where once neonics got introduced in the 1990s and shortly thereafter they experienced large scale bee die offs When Bayer officials discuss the claims against the company and research that s critical of any of its products they use words like misrepresentation and anti neonic attack to describe those claims For example in his message in the 2023 annual report for Bayer CEO Bill Anderson reported that the company will continue to advance its message about the safety of glyphosate The scientific and regulatory facts are on our side as was demonstrated again last year when the safety of glyphosate was confirmed by its reapproval in the European Union We will make every effort to ensure that the plaintiff attorneys are not allowed to misrepresent these facts in court After all we want to invest our resources in innovation not in the US litigation industry Creating carefully crafted messaging around the company s

The rusty patched bumble bee was once common in New York state but has disappeared Photo credit Xerces Society Rich Hatfield Rusty patched bumble bees They re on posters They re on stickers They ve

Empire State Native Pollinator Survey found that not only had the rusty patched bumble bees disappeared but that as many as 60 percent of the state s native pollinators were in danger of vanishing from New York completely Using the most conservative criteria 38 percent of the species that were studied were at risk of disappearing from the state I think it is a really sobering finding and it really matches some of the other literature and studies on insect declines said Matthew Schlesinger chief zoologist for the New York Natural Heritage Program which conducted the survey All insects to some degree are threatened by pesticide use and habitat loss and climate change he said That doesn t mean they re all going to disappear tomorrow Some of them are just rare and have always been rare But it s true that rarity is one of the factors that can lead to extinction Schlesinger and a team of academic scientists citizen scientists and other experts from universities museums and nonprofit groups collected data on more than 400 species of four types of pollinators beetles bees flies and moths from 2017 to 2020 They compared contemporary field observations with records of insect

insecticides have also been banned for outdoor use in Québec and the European Union New York Assembly Member Deborah J Glick who sponsored the Birds and Bees Act said that the news about the dangers facing pollinators in the state along with extensive scientific literature linking those losses to the use of neonicotinoid insecticides informed the legislation In my humble opinion there was overwhelming evidence that it was an effect not just on honeybees but on all native species said Glick a Democrat who represents parts of lower Manhattan She credited a compilation of studies as factors in the legislation I am very grateful to all of the scientists who do the laborious work that provides data One of those studies released in 2020 by researchers at Cornell University found that neonicotinoid treated seeds increased risks to pollinators while not increasing net income for the state s corn and soybean producers Two hundred citizen scientists For the state Natural Heritage Project s large scale study on pollinators more than 200 citizen scientists participated in field studies In all more than 34 000 individual specimens were identified to the species level during three

vice versa So that s what the trend is based on The academic team created digital maps with layers that showed several variables Whether a species had been recorded in an area before 1999 whether it had been recorded after 2000 and whether it had been identified during the recent survey period The maps also included data by ecoregions such as the Great Lakes and the North Atlantic Coast as well as county level distributions The distribution data combined with reviews of scientific literature and expert assessments of threats to the insects contributed to the determination of the conservation status of each species Each received a rank on a 6 point scale that ranged from apparently secure to presumed extirpated which meant that the insects had not been located despite intensive searches with virtually no likelihood that it will be rediscovered In a few cases they found good news Eight species of bees that had been targeted for conservation were added to the list of known species in the state The Bombus terricola or yellow banded bumblebee is a candidate for the federal endangered list These bumble bees were more common in New York than the team expected them to be They re doing OK in New York Schlesinger said and that was comforting The team found other bees such as the golden northern bumble bee in places where they did not expect to find them New York City of all things was a hot spot Schlesinger said He credits the increases in some species to public awareness and a desire to make the world better for pollinators The movement to not have a sterile green lawn has really picked up steam he said and a lot of people have much more pollinator friendly lawns and are reducing their pesticide use So it s more habitat and fewer toxins and I think those are really

that their products harm bees Beekeeping advocates question the tally from the 2022 bee colony census because it differs from their own totals of bee colonies Also they suspect bias in the estimate because of the high nonresponse rate to the five year agricultural census from the U S Department of Agriculture a rate that has increased substantially since the last census in 2017 That 3 8 million

still providing the most comprehensive and impartial ag data in the industry For the five year census of agriculture the USDA surveys farm owners and managers by postal mail online questionnaires and

response rate from farm owners and managers was 61 percent Five years before in 2017 the response rate to the agricultural survey was 71 percent For the five year census the USDA does not publish specific response rates for farms with bee colonies Further complicating the issue the USDA releases two distinct numbers for bee colonies An annual survey of honey producers has consistently reported about 2 9 million honey producing colonies in the United States Respondents who report fewer than five colonies are excluded from those results In that survey the response rate from honey producers is 55 5 percent The five year survey which produced the estimate of 3 8 million colonies drew on responses from farm producers All operations with known colonies are reported in the results of that survey It counts all plots of land both rural and urban if 1 000 worth of products were raised and sold there or could have been sold there during the survey year The USDA did not release the number of operators with bee colonies that responded to the survey but in a statement noted that based on the reported data there were nearly 74 000 farms with bee colonies in the United States in 2022 In a

denials of the interviews In one case a public relations specialist declined an interview after the scientist said that he was happy to arrange a time to speak with you in an email exchange with a reporter In the other case officials denied a request after the scientist submitted it to the communications department for approval In all U S Right to Know requested interviews with seven USDA scientists on the matter which did not relate to the scientists work for the federal government Several scientists did not respond to the inquiry Jeff Ruch Pacific director of the nonprofit group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said that the First Amendment rights of government scientists are under attack The ability of scientists to speak and write on matters of public concern whether in their field or not right now is up in the air he said The topic of the interviews proposed by U S Right to Know dealt with a component of the researchers citizenship activities in the scientific community and fell outside their duties for the federal government Before the first denial for an interview with the scientist who was willing to speak on the topic Public Relations Specialist Jessica Ryan asked for a detailed list of questions by email and asked if U S Right to Know granted pre publication review After receiving a list of questions along with an explanation of the organization s policy to not submit articles for review before publication the official said that the scientist won t be available to answer questions for this story Ryan did not respond to repeated requests for a reason for the denial In the second case Ryan responded by recommending that the reporter call an outside organization instead of the USDA In this case she also did not respond to repeated requests for an explanation for the denial of the interview The USDA oversees important public health matters including recalls of meat and poultry as well as monitoring of bird flu The agency also bears partial oversight in communication about nutrition labeling along with the Centers for Disease Control and Health and Human Services Among press advocacy groups this type of silencing of federal employees is known as censorship by PIO or public information officer In recent reports the Society of Professional Journalists has found a relatively rapid trend toward

Vogus deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation a nonprofit group that protects and defends public interest journalism You re not the only journalist who thinks this is a problem The problem is magnified she said when the sources who are silenced are scientists The American people rely on journalists to translate very complicated pieces of science for them including science being done by our government Vogus said Because scientific issues are complicated she said I think it s all the more important that journalists are able to talk to the scientists directly when they re trying to report on these issues Ruch said that PEER has represented more than 50 federal scientists in the last 30 years who work in about a dozen federal agencies Most faced official restraints on their speaking or writing about their research This is about control of information Ruch said In the past he said the USDA silenced scientists by applying a regulation that governs scientific integrity The policy is designed to ensure that government employees only disseminate high quality consistent scientific information to the public Ruch said agency officials have employed provisions of the policy to shut down public communication from scientists that included conference presentations and peer reviews of articles in scientific journals The operative clause he said was that USDA scientists should refrain from making or publishing statements that could be construed as being judgments of or recommendations on USDA or any other Federal Government policy The inquiry by U S Right to Know did not delve into federal policy but into work outside the agency Also the scientific integrity policy stipulates that when communicating with the media or the public in their personal capacities USDA scientists may express their personal views and opinions Personal or private activities may not violate Federal ethics rules Ruch pointed out that policies to silence the speech of scientists are spreading to other agencies that oversee critical public health functions including the Centers for Disease Control New rules for several federal agencies including the Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health and Human Services are as restrictive as those that have been imposed on USDA scientists He was not surprised to hear that several scientists having seen their peers silenced declined to respond It seems to me they would be prudently deterred from speaking on any topic he said", "chunk_id":

and subsidies for industrial agriculture in Africa are harming food security in one of the world s hungriest regions according to a network of African groups asking donors to switch their funding to

International Development and other donors to stop financing the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA The billion dollar effort has unequivocally failed in its mission and harmed broader

Biodiversity and Biosafety Association of Kenya Her group and hundreds of others are boycotting the UN Summit because they say it has been captured by corporations and donors who are pushing technological solutions for hunger while ignoring systemic changes necessary to address hunger and poverty That AGRA s president Agnes Kalibata is leading the UN food summit is a conflict of interest critics said because AGRA is also fundraising for its own programs Failing green revolution Hunger has worsened considerably since the Gates and Rockefeller foundations led a high profile effort to bring the green revolution to Africa in 2006 AGRA s main focus is transitioning farmers away from traditional seeds and crops to commercial seeds synthetic fertilizer and other inputs to grow

had little if any positive impact on Africa s small scale farmers Reports published in 2020 by the Tufts Global Development and Environment Institute and African and German groups found slow productivity growth for staple crops and no evidence of rising incomes for small scale farmers The evidence also suggests that farmers are abandoning more nutritious climate resilient crops such as millet to grow maize AGRA views AGRA disagreed with the research but has not produced comprehensive reporting of its results over 15 years The lofty 2020 goals were removed from AGRA s website

methods they say can provide more abundant nutritious foods protect the environment and create a more equitable sustainable food system Leading experts in food security and nutrition have also called for a paradigm shift away from chemical dependent industrial agriculture and toward agroecology and policies that address social issues and inequality However donors such as the Gates Foundation the leading private donor to agricultural development in Africa are holding back investments in agroecological research according to a 2020 report from sustainable food system experts For some of the top donors agroecology does not fit within existing investment modalities the researchers said Like many philanthropic givers the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation looks for quick tangible returns on investment and thus favors targeted technological solutions As many as 85 of Gates Foundation research grants supported industrial agriculture the report notes while merely 3 contained elements of agroecology Kenyan research centers also spent heavily on industrial agriculture In Kenya low awareness of alternatives to the new Green Revolution model emerged as the greatest barrier to supporting

and farmers to make decisions for themselves Steiner said he is particularly proud of the hundreds of soil scientists and plant breeders with significant representation of women developing crops suited for the African environment that are building African self reliance As evidence of AGRA s progress he pointed to AGRA s most recent impact report a report on its seed system program and an impact report by an AGRA partner the One Acre Fund As AGRA moves forward Steiner said I have no doubt that it will continue to embrace more regenerative circular agricultural approaches and we look forward to partnering with them in also adopting renewable energy into their programs Seed laws and the 800 pound gorilla African groups were not impressed by AGRA s reporting methods and said they

transformation as a process by which farmers shift from highly diversified subsistence oriented production towards more specialized production oriented towards the market or other systems of exchange involving a greater reliance on input and output delivery systems and increased integration of agriculture with other sectors of the domestic and international economies Several groups have analyzed the foundation s agricultural development funding The following themes emerge from that research The Gates Foundation is primarily supporting Researchers and groups in Northern wealthy countries not farmers or groups in Africa A June 2021 analysis of 1 130 Gates Foundation grants for agriculture since 2003 found the grants are heavily skewed to technologies developed by research centres and corporations in the North for poor farmers in the South completely ignoring the knowledge technologies and biodiversity that these farmers already possess according to the GRAIN research group Many of the grants were given to groups that lobby on behalf of industrial farming and undermine alternatives GRAIN wrote Pushing i ndustrial agriculture As many as 85 of Gates Foundation funded agricultural

for commercial seeds and fertilizer The second largest single recipient of Gates grant funding for agriculture is the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA with 638 million in grants to date AGRA s primary focus is increasing farmers access to commercial seeds and fertilizers that AGRA said would boost yields and lift small farmers out of poverty This green revolution technology package of commercial seeds and agrichemicals is further supported by about 1 billion per year in subsidies from African governments but evidence shows these interventions have not delivered the promised

first major evaluation of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation s controversial efforts to expand capital intensive high input agriculture in Africa found that the 15 year effort has failed to achieve its goals of improving food security The Gates led Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA aimed to transform agriculture in Africa by increasing incomes and food security for millions of smallholder farmers But an independent evaluation by the consulting firm Mathematica provides no evidence of progress toward these goals The evaluation posted Feb 28 2022 was funded by the Gates Foundation on behalf of AGRA s lead donors including the Rockefeller Foundation and government agencies in the U S U K and Germany It is the only macro level performance review of AGRA released to the public since the effort launched in 2006 Still the review of AGRA s core strategy the Partnership Inclusive Agricultural Transformation in Africa PIATA is far from comprehensive covering just five years leaving out many of AGRA s target countries and offering few details on key metrics including specifics on yields and incomes Although AGRA operates in 11 countries the analysis reports only on select countries for each outcome it measured Among the details that were reported Yields for maize the most heavily subsidized crop increased in just three countries Ethiopia Ghana and Nigeria but not in Tanzania Burkina Faso or Kenya as a result of PIATA Only one country Burkina Faso shows evidence of increased farmer incomes related to PIATA Few details are provided about the size or scope of these impacts The mixed results for farmer outcomes the report notes likely reflect remaining farmer constraints in access to affordable inputs and output markets as well as low per farmer investment levels These findings suggest that AGRA did not meet its headline goal of increased incomes and food security for 9 million smallholders despite reaching over 10 million smallholders an expected outcome AGRA response In a formal published response AGRA said that finding is an expected outcome and a true reflection of the realities that farmers AGRA and other institutions that support farmers today live with daily The admission is a major departure from AGRA s earlier rhetoric the group has raised over 1 billion two thirds of that from the Gates Foundation on promises it would double

sector It notes for example that over 700 village based advisors are using digital platforms to register farmers and broadcast information on weather seeds and fertilizer to over 30 000 farmers

financial means to buy fertilizers If we can help poor farmers raise their crop yields they ll earn more money and have more to eat and millions of people in some of the world s poorest countries will

post Why we re tracking Bill Gates plans to remake the food system Ramping up greenhouse gas emissions Gates is not shy about his passion for synthetic fertilizer as he explains in this blog about his visit to the Yara fertilizer distribution plant in Dar es Salaam Tanzania The new plant is the largest of its kind in East Africa Fertilizer is a magical invention that can help lift millions of people out of poverty Gates writes Watching workers fill bags with the tiny white pellets containing nitrogen phosphorous and other plant nutrients was a powerful reminder of how every ounce of fertilizer has the potential to transform lives in Africa Corp Watch describes Yara Europe s biggest industrial buyer of natural gas as the fertilizer giant causing climate catastrophe Yara actively lobbies for fracking and is a top producer of synthetic fertilizers that scientists say are responsible for worrying increases in emissions of nitrous oxide The greenhouse gas is 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the planet According to a recent Nature paper nitrous oxide emissions driven largely by agriculture are rising in an increasing feedback loop that is putting us on a worst case trajectory for climate change Gates acknowledges that synthetic fertilizers harm the climate As a solution Gates hopes for technological inventions on the horizon including an experimental project to genetically engineer microbes to fix nitrogen to soil If these approaches work Gates writes they ll dramatically reduce the need for fertilizer and all the emissions it s responsible for In the meantime the key focus of Gates green revolution efforts for Africa is expanding the use of synthetic fertilizer with the aim of boosting yields even though there isn t any evidence to show that 14 years of these efforts have helped small farmers or the poor or produced significant yield gains Expanding climate harming monocultures The Gates Foundation has spent over 5 billion since 2006 to help drive agricultural transformation in Africa The bulk of the funding goes to technical research and efforts to transition African farmers to industrial agricultural methods

a model of industrial monoculture farming and food processing that is not sustaining our people a group of faith leaders from Africa wrote in a letter to the foundation raising concerns that the foundation s support for the expansion of intensive industrial agriculture is deepening the humanitarian crisis The foundation they noted encourages African farmers to adopt a high input high output approach that is based on a business model developed in a Western setting and puts pressure on farmers to grow just one or a few crops based on commercial high yielding or genetically modified GM seeds Gates flagship agricultural program the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA steers farmers toward maize and other staple crops with the aim of boosting yields According to AGRA s operational plan for Uganda emphasis theirs Agricultural transformation is defined as a process by which farmers shift from highly diversified subsistence oriented production towards more specialized production oriented towards the market or other systems of exchange involving a greater reliance on input and output delivery systems and increased integration of agriculture with other sectors of the domestic and international economies AGRA s primary focus is programs to increase farmers access to commercial seeds and fertilizers to grow maize and a few other crops This green revolution technology package is further supported by 1 billion a year in subsidies from African governments according to research published last year by the Tufts Global Development and Environment Institute and report by African and German groups The researchers found no sign of a productivity boom the data show modest yield gains of 18 for staple crops in AGRA s target countries while incomes stagnated and food security worsened with the number of hungry and undernourished people up 30 AGRA disputed the research but has not provided detailed reporting of its results over 15 years An AGRA

Jomo Kwame Sundaram former UN assistant secretary general for economic development wrote in an article describing the research The AGRA package he notes was imposed with a heavy hand in Rwanda with the government reportedly banning cultivation of some other staple crops in some areas Diverting resources from agroecology If global food systems are to become sustainable input intensive crop monocultures and industrial scale feedlots must become obsolete the African faith leaders wrote in their appeal to the Gates Foundation Indeed many experts say a paradigm shift is necessary away from uniform monoculture cropping systems toward diversified agroecological approaches that can address the problems and limitations of industrial agriculture including inequalities increased poverty malnutrition and ecosystem degradation The 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC warns against the damaging effects of monocropping and highlights the importance of agroecology which the panel said could improve the sustainability and resilience of agricultural systems by buffering climate extremes reducing degradation of soils and reversing unsustainable use of resources and consequently increase yield without damaging biodiversity Rupa Marya MD associate professor of medicine at UCSF discusses agroecology at the 2021 EcoFarm conference A UN Food and Agriculture Organization expert panel report on agroecology clearly calls for a shift away from the green revolution industrial agriculture model and toward agroecological practices that have been shown to increase the diversity of food crops reduce costs and build climate resilience But programs to scale up agroecology are starving for funding as billions in aid and subsidies go to prop up industrial agriculture models Key barriers holding back investments in agroecology include donor preferences for profitability scalability and short term results according to a 2020 report from the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems IPES Food As many as 85 of Gates Foundation funded agricultural development research projects for Africa in recent years were limited to supporting industrial agriculture and or increasing its efficiency via targeted approaches such as improved pesticide practices livestock vaccines or reductions in post harvest losses the report said

systemic and rights based approaches but a proposed restructuring plan to create One CGIAR with a single board and new agenda setting powers is raising concerns According to IPES food the restructuring proposal threatens to reduce the autonomy of regional research agendas and reinforce the grip of the most powerful donors such as the Gates Foundation who are reluctant to diverge from the Green Revolution pathway The restructuring process led by a Gates Foundation representative and former leader of the Syngenta Foundation appears to have been driven forward in a coercive manner IPES said with little buy in from the supposed beneficiaries in the global South with insufficient diversity among the inner circle of reformers and without due consideration of the urgently needed paradigm shift in food systems Meanwhile the Gates Foundation has kicked in another 310 million to CGIAR to help 300 million smallholder farmers adapt to climate change Inventing new uses for GMO

years the chemical industry promised GMO crops would boost yields reduce pesticides and feed the world sustainably but it hasn t turned out that way As Danny Hakim reported in the New York Times GMO crops did not produce better yields The GMO crops also drove up the use of herbicides especially glyphosate which is linked to cancer among other health and environmental problems As weeds became resistant the industry developed seeds with new chemical tolerances Bayer for example is forging ahead with GMO crops engineered to survive five herbicides Mexico recently announced plans to ban GMO

could possibly go wrong Systemic risk One of the world s foremost experts on probability and uncertainty Nassim Taleb considered that question What could go wrong with GMOs for a 2014 paper he wrote with colleagues at the New York University School of Engineering The authors analyzed GMOs in the context of what they called a non naive view of the Precautionary Principle They concluded GMOs represent a public risk of global harm and should be subject to severe limits The Precautionary Principle states that if an action has a suspected risk of causing severe harm to the public domain the action should not be taken in the absence of scientific near certainty about its safety The authors believe it should be evoked only in extreme situations when the potential harm is systemic and the consequences widespread and irreversible they said GMOs fall squarely within this criteria Among the systemic risks they cited GMOs have the propensity to spread uncontrollably with irreversible system wide effects and unknown downsides The ecological impacts are not tested empirically and therefore not understood before the technologies are released The researchers noted two factors that contribute to systemic risk the engineered genetic modifications and the monocultures in which they grow Instead of a long history of evolutionary selection these modifications rely not just on naive engineering strategies that do not appropriately consider risk in complex environments but also explicitly reductionist approaches that ignore unintended consequences the researchers said Labeling the GMO approach scientific betrays a verypoor indeed warped understanding of probabilisticpayoffs and risk management Taleb summed up their conclusions in a 2015 New York Times op ed The GMO experiment

development of capacities for analysis showing the return on agricultural research for development and to equitable policy formulation and implementation ie policies for enforcing property rights

philanthropists and agribusiness companies to implement policies in Africa that criminalize seed saving This past summer the global trade regime finalized details for a revolution in African agriculture Based on draft laws written more than three decades ago in Geneva by Western seed companies the new generation of agricultural reforms seeks to institute legal and financial penalties throughout the African Union for farmers who fail to adopt foreign engineered seeds protected by patents including genetically modified versions of native seeds The resulting seed economy would transform African farming into a bonanza for global agribusiness promote export oriented monocultures and undermine resilience during a time of deepening climate disruption The most direct beneficiaries of this plan Zaitchik wrote are four company oligopoly that controls half the global seed market and 75 percent of the global agrichemicals market Bayer formerly Monsanto Corteva formerly DowDuPont BASF and Syngenta a subsidiary of ChemChina The article provides important historical context about the Gates Foundation s role in the new seed economy Why is the Gates Foundation

the Covid 19 pandemic according to a sobering United Nations report released Monday The report is the first comprehensive assessment of hunger since the pandemic struck and estimates a 25 increase in the number of severely undernourished people across the globe While no region of the world was spared Africa was the hardest hit The report estimates that more than a third of the continent s population is undernourished Nearly 2 37 billion people did not have access to adequate food in 2020 Hunger and malnutrition have been worsening for over a decade the report notes due to conflicts economic recessions and climate extremes But the pandemic continues to expose weaknesses in our food systems UN leaders said warning that we are at a critical juncture to transform food systems They pointed to the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit UNFSS the COP26 on climate change and Nutrition for Growth Summit as crucial events that will shape how food systems develop in the years ahead These events are mired in controversy however For over a year the Food Systems Summit has sparked criticism protests and calls for boycotts from food security experts UN insiders and hundreds of organizations from Africa and other countries A chief concern of the critics is the dominant role of large corporations and private donors including the Gates Foundation which are pushing a narrow set of approaches for profit driven agricultural development African groups described the approach as business as usual quick technofix policy prescriptions of the agribusiness agendas What is needed instead these groups said is a radical shift from fossil fuel based industrial agriculture and corporate monopolies of food and agriculture to food sovereignty and agroecology Sharp criticism of food

Mechanism The High Level Panel of Experts on food security and nutrition which advises the CFS called in 2019 for a paradigm shift away from industrial agricultural and toward agroecological

food system negotiations The 2021 UNFSS was announced alongside a new partnership agreement between the UN and World Economic Forum the first of its kind UN Secretary General António Guterres then appointed Agnes Kalibata president of the Gates funded Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA to lead the food summit These moves sparked outrage from hundreds of groups who called for termination of the WEF agreement and asked for Kalibata s appointment to be revoked over concerns that AGRA promotes ahigh input agricultural model is not sustainable beyond constant subsidy which is drawn from increasingly scarce public resources Although Kalibata vowed the summit would consider all stakeholders interests tensions continue to mount In a new report published last week the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems IPES Food described a problematic new science policy framework and governance structure proposed through the food summit If adopted the plan

works on inequalities and global health policy at the University of Edinburgh Scotland UK dug through funding disclosures from donors on the WHO Foundation website Since its launch the foundation has disclosed donations over 82 million of which more than 62 per cent were anonymous the analysis found Most of these were donations over 100 000 And the proportion of anonymous donations rose over time In 2023 the foundation did not disclose the source of nearly 80 of contributions up from nearly 40 in its first two years Using a scale to judge transparency in donations developed by Open Democracy an independent international media platform the researchers gave the WHO Foundation a D grade This grade is for organizations that only name a minority of funders and not in a systematic way putting it on par with some dark money think tanks the researchers wrote The foundation s grade fell from a B in its first years of operating when it disclosed at least 85 of funders who gave 100 000 or more

priorities don t always match national needs plans and priorities the researchers wrote Where disclosures were made public such as by Meta the donations suggest some strategic alignment with their own priorities rather than giving for charitable means the authors wrote For example Meta gave funding for the WHO department of communication and digital health In both of these areas large social media

poor optics of this kind Lisa Bero professor of medicine and public health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus who specializes in bioethics and conflict of interest says the WHO

second WHO mission to China in January 2021 concluded that the lab accident hypothesis was an extremely unlikely pathway WHO mission head Peter Ben Embarek later said that language was the result of a compromise with Chinese experts who initially pushed to exclude any mention of a lab accident from the report altogether The White House expressed deep concerns about China strong arming its work The

Frieman continued To be sure Fauci may have sought Baric s advice in those early days in part because of his preeminence in coronavirus research In virology circles Baric was the big cheese in coronaviruses Frieman said in a 2015 media article Fauci who recently retired as the head of the National Institutes of Health s infectious diseases division was already meeting frequently with the White House as it formulated a response to the emerging outbreak However other emails lay out the nature of Fauci s most pressing interest in Baric s work in the week prior to their meeting Together the emails suggest Fauci has not disclosed the depth of his concerns about the Wuhan lab and its connection to the research enterprise he steered for decades Fauci was alerted in late January that the

pathogens in animals The quiet start at the Kunming lab could suggest skittishness among Chinese authorities about publicizing it due to the controversy surrounding another BSL 4 lab the Wuhan Institute of Virology It also underscores that international standards for reporting and transparency have lagged behind the proliferation of labs working with pandemic potential pathogens The Kunming National Primate Research Center of High Level Biosafety received accreditation in late 2018 or early 2019 according to a presentation given at a U S China summit The lab works with rhesus monkeys according to the documents Yunzhang Hu a professor at the Institute of Medical Biology told the summit that the lab s aims include developing medical countermeasures and supporting emergency response to emerging infectious diseases While U S institutions like the National Academies were aware of the Kunming lab it was apparently not widely understood that the lab has been making strides toward research on high risk pathogens for years A World Health Organization report in 2017 listed three BSL 4 or ABSL 4 labs in China two in operation in Wuhan and Harbin and a third planned in Beijing The Kunming lab is not mentioned A map of BSL 4 labs assembled by top Western biodefense experts does not report the Kunming lab either While the lab s work appeared in scientific papers in 2020 and 2021 demonstrating it was operational China may not have publicized it in part because of international concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology a BSL 4 lab at the pandemic s epicenter according to Gregory Koblentz director of the biodefense program at George Mason University s Schar School of Policy and Government and co creator of the map Koblentz said he became aware of the lab shortly after

Accreditation from the CNAS is needed before the Ministry of Health can approve a BSL 4 lab according to the scientific journal Efforts to support BSL 4 work in Kunming predate the lab s accreditation U S researchers funded by the U S Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases traveled to Kunming in 2014 to review animal facilities and present information on BSL 4 technical requirements according to a federal grant report Training continued throughout the year The Kunming lab s researchers traveled to a U S maximum biocontainment lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch for further training U S China summit The U S China dialogue was co hosted by the National Academy of Sciences and held in Harbin China in January 2019 The topics centered on the opportunities and risks of gene editing in infectious diseases research The Harbin summit was the fourth in a series on biosafety involving both American and Chinese institutions and came just a year before reports of a novel coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan U S biodefense experts began planning in June for a firth summit slated for October or November 2019 according to other documents obtained by U S Right to Know But Chinese partners suggested a summit under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan rather than under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Kunming the emails indicate The January summit in Harbin included presentations from many experts who have since become central to the COVID 19 origins controversy The summit included two sessions on science and ethics in research with pathogens with pandemic potential and understanding and engineering viral pathogens with pandemic potential The sessions described technical challenges with engineering chimeric viruses as well as the safety

altering a virus receptor binding domain and passaging through mice can sometimes be required to generate more dangerous viruses Baric also noted the ease of synthesizing coronaviruses saying the cost had decreased from 42 000 to 6 000 and the relative ease of using CRISPR technology to create humanized mice Stanford School of Medicine microbiologist David Relman who has recently been critical of virologists who have prematurely declared the origins debate settled gave a presentation on responsibly preventing lab accidents as BSL 4 labs proliferate Relman also raised questions about the feasibility and safety of the Global Virome Project an effort to collect and catalog millions of animal viruses involving EcoHealth Alliance and Shi In an era in which most viruses can be synthesized from a genetic sequence the discovery of new viruses and elucidation of their properties may present both biosafety and biosecurity concerns Relman told the group Chinese experts expressed concerns about these issues too An expert with Tianjin University told the summit that balancing the positive uses and potential for misuse of pandemic potential pathogens made in the lab poses challenges The expert voiced concerns about the potential for rapid changes in science and technology capabilities to outpace ethical and regulatory measures and the need for appropriate governance the summary reads

of coronavirus in doubt science journals investigating 11 9 20 Email communications with Dr Jinping Chen senior author of Liu et al Dr Jinping Chen s emails raise a number of concerns and questions 1 Liu et al 2020 assembled their published pangolin coronavirus genome sequence based on coronaviruses sampled from three pangolins two samples from a smuggled batch in March 2019 and one sample from a different batch intercepted in July 2019 The National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI database where scientists are required to deposit sequence data to ensure independent verification and reproducibility of published results contains the sequence read archive SRA data for the two March 2019 samples but is missing data for the July 2019 sample Upon being asked about this missing sample which Dr Jinping Chen identifies as F9 Dr Jinping Chen stated The raw data of these three samples could be found under NCBI accession number PRJNA573298 and the BioSample ID were SAMN12809952 SAMN12809953 and SAMN12809954 moreover individual F9 from different batch was also positive the raw data can be seen in NCBI SRA SUB 7661929 which will be released soon for we have another MS under review our emphasis It is concerning that Liu et al have not published data corresponding to 1 of the 3 pangolins samples that they used to assemble their pangolin coronavirus genome sequence Dr Jinping Chen also did not share this data upon being asked The norm in science is to publish and or share all data that would allow others to independently verify and reproduce the results How did PLoS Pathogens let Liu et al evade publishing crucial sample data Why is Dr Jinping Chen not sharing data pertaining to this third pangolin sample Why would Liu et al want to release unpublished data pertaining to this third pangolin sample as part of another study that has been submitted to a different journal The concern here is that scientists would misattribute the missing pangolin sample from

CoV 2 origins Newly obtained emails offer glimpses into how a narrative of certainty developed about the natural origins of the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 while key scientific questions remained The internal discussions and an early draft of a scientists letter show experts discussing gaps in knowledge and unanswered questions about lab origin even as some sought to tamp down on fringe theories about the possibility the virus came from a lab Influential scientists and many news outlets have described the evidence as overwhelming that the virus originated in wildlife not from a lab However a year after the first reported cases of SARS CoV 2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan little is known how or where the virus originated Understanding the origins of SARS CoV 2 which causes the disease COVID 19 may be crucial to preventing the next pandemic The emails of coronavirus expert Professor Ralph Baric obtained through a public records request by U S Right to Know show conversations between National Academy of Sciences NAS representatives and experts in biosecurity and infectious diseases from U S universities and the EcoHealth Alliance On Feb 3 the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy OSTP asked the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine NASEM to convene meeting of experts to assess what data information and samples are needed to address the unknowns in order to understand the evolutionary origins of 2019 nCoV and more effectively respond to both the outbreak and any resulting misinformation Baric and other infectious disease experts were involved in drafting the response The emails show the experts internal discussions and an early draft dated Feb 4 The early draft described initial views of the experts that the available genomic data are consistent with natural evolution and that there is currently no evidence that the virus was engineered to spread more quickly among humans This draft sentence posed a question in parentheses ask experts to add specifics re binding sites It also included a footnote in parentheses possibly add brief explanation that this does not preclude an unintentional release from a laboratory studying the evolution of related coronaviruses In one email dated Feb 4 infectious disease expert Trevor Bedford commented I wouldn t mention binding sites here If you start weighing evidence there s a lot to consider for both scenarios By both scenarios Bedford appears to refer to lab origin and natural origin scenarios The question of binding sites is important to the debate about the origins of SARS CoV

natural spillover in the wild or deliberate laboratory recombination of an as yet undisclosed natural ancestor of SARS CoV 2 The final letter published Feb 6 did not mention binding sites or the possibility of a laboratory origin It does make clear that more information is necessary to determine the origins of SARS CoV 2 The letter states The experts informed us that additional genomic sequence data from geographically and temporally diverse viral samples are needed to determine the origin and evolution of the virus Samples collected as early as possible in the outbreak in Wuhan and samples from wildlife would be particularly valuable The emails show some experts discussing the need for clear language to counter what one described as crackpot theories of lab origin Kristian Andersen lead author of an influential Nature Medicine paper asserting a natural origin of SARS CoV 2 said the early draft was great but I do wonder if we need to be more firm on the question of engineering He continued If one of the main purposes of this document is to counter those fringe theories I think it s very important that we do so strongly and in plain language In his response Baric aimed at conveying a scientific basis for SARS CoV 2 s natural origin I do think we need to say that the closest relative to this virus 96 was identified from bats circulating in a cave in Yunnan

CoV 2 Photo credit NIAID The National Institutes of Health should improve how it regulates lab generated viruses that could pose a national security risk according to its biosecurity advisers The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity highlighted wide gaps in the oversight of controversial projects that create enhanced pandemic potential pathogens in preliminary recommendations to the NIH The report comes ahead of a public meeting to finalize recommendations this week Privately funded research that risks causing a pandemic occurs largely in the shadows the group found Meanwhile NIH funded research with pandemic risks is falling through the cracks of the agency s vague internal processes On paper NIH funded projects that could pose a pandemic risk are subject to an extra layer of regulatory review by the enhanced pandemic potential pathogens committee or P3CO In practice the NIH refers few research projects for closer scrutiny the NSABB says echoing the concerns of nonpartisan experts In rare instances where projects are referred for review by the P3CO the deliberation occurs in secret The composition of the P3CO is unknown to anyone outside of the process except for the NSABB and a few members of Congress The biosecurity advisers say that regulation should be expanded beyond a small fraction of the life sciences research enterprise and recommend more transparency to build public trust The group also recommends tougher rules for determining whether safer approaches like pseudotyping or in silico experiments could answer the same scientific questions and evaluating whether the project has a potential payoff for public health The group also recommended broadening the definition of an enhanced pandemic potential pathogen to include any engineered virus with the potential to overwhelm the health care system Though not stated explicitly in its report COVID 19 has demonstrated the capacity of a virus with low virulence but high transmissibility to kill millions and upend hundreds of millions of lives The group also recommended expanding oversight of a related field of research dual use research of concern DURC refers to research with scientific aims but which could also be used to generate a bioweapon NSABB recommended expanding the definition of DURC to include viruses that pose a national security risk if accidentally released not just research that could be intentionally weaponized The group also recommended subjecting foreign labs using U S funds and performing high risk experiments to U S regulations Last August the NIH terminated a subgrant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology a lab at the COVID 19 pandemic s epicenter for failing to meet U S regulations The draft recommendations have been three years in the making The advisory

of the debate In the intervening years COVID 19 has moved pandemics out of the realm of abstract threats The debate about gain of function virology once generated little interest outside the infectious diseases community with virologists concerned about censorship on one side and epidemiologists and microbiologists concerned about lab escape on the other It has since moved into the mainstream Laboratory made viruses have drawn unprecedented public concern But the issue was placed on the backburner as the advisers responded to more urgent public health needs in the pandemic s chaotic early months In 2022 HHS reconvened the NSABB and held public meetings Experts have sought to clarify the conflation of gain of function research and the creation of more dangerous viruses Tweaking flu strains to grow well in eggs in order to generate annual flu vaccines may be considered gain of function research for example But the benefits of creating more dangerous strains of viruses in the lab have not been well articulated The NSABB describes the benefits of enhanced pandemic potential research in terms of what may be possible in the future stating that the existence of these technological capabilities creates a moral obligation to explore its possibilities But the NSABB also underlines the need to consider the risks Government Accountability Office highlights lack of accountability Scientists and members of the public have in particular flagged the gain of function research undertaken in Wuhan under low biosafety standards with SARS like viruses The scientific collaborations undertaken in Wuhan included scientists with a stated interest in polybasic cleavage sites in coronaviruses much like the furin cleavage site found in SARS CoV 2 which some scientists believe could be engineered Those concerns have been met with an often caustic rebuttal by prominent virologists who have cast these worries as fringe and conspiratorial However nonpartisan government watchdogs released a report Wednesday flagging chronic lapses in the oversight of pandemic potential pathogen research Scientists advising the Government Accountability Office confirmed that research on pandemic potential pathogens has gone unregulated in several respects The National Institutes of Health and specifically the NIH s infectious diseases institute the NIAID has underwritten nearly

that they re seeing all of them Though not cited by the report a controversial experiment undertaken at the Wuhan Institute of Virology with a NIAID subgrant has generated concerns about whether controversial projects are slipping the agency s notice or receiving carveouts The experiment generated a SARS like virus with 10 000 times its initial viral load but was not subject to the proper oversight NIH said it was because the result was unexpected The lapse in oversight has been criticized by members of Congress and biosecurity experts NIH requested complete lab notes related to the experiment from the Wuhan Institute of Virology but has been rebuffed Private research on pandemic potential pathogens is unregulated unless it involves a select agent For example a privately funded lab voluntarily informed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would generate a virus unlikely to arise in nature a hybrid virus splicing together the original SARS virus and SARS CoV

Duc drills down on include whether any of the labs were studying coronaviruses that can replicate in culture which may have made them better adapted to infect human cells He also asks whether biological safety cabinets were certified and used whether the lab has a history of disgruntled employees and whether there is controlled access to pathogens He suggests an examination of whether the air handling systems were properly maintained citing the 1979 release of anthrax from a Soviet lab In an earlier email exchange in April 2020 former president of the American Society of Tropical

and virologist Edward C Holmes University of Edinburgh virologist Andrew Rambaut and Scripps Research virologist Kristian G Andersen wrote in Nature in 2018 that the Global Virome Project is unlikely to predict pandemics because animal viruses so rarely cause epidemics in humans Around 250 human viruses have been described and only a small subset of these have caused major epidemics this century they wrote Advocates of prediction also argue that it will be possible to anticipate how likely a virus is to emerge in people on the basis of its sequence and by using knowledge of how it interacts with cells obtained for instance by studying the virus in human cell cultures This is misguided At the time they pointed out that its cost would comprise roughly one fourth the entire budget for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the U S agency that funds most viral research And that is not accounting for the speedy evolution of certain viruses which could quickly make the data collected outdated they wrote More recently Holmes again critiqued the idea of deep surveillance of viruses in wildlife in an editorial even while underscoring the importance of regulating live

The interior of the Galveston National Laboratory is pictured Photo credit UTMB April 20 3 40 p m This story has been updated with comment from UTMB The Wuhan Institute of Virology has the right to ask a partnering lab in the U S to destroy all records of their work according to a legal document obtained by U S Right to Know A memorandum of understanding between the Wuhan lab and the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch states that each lab can ask the other to return or destroy any so called secret files any communications documents data or equipment resulting from their collaboration and ask that they wipe any copies The party is entitled to ask the other to destroy and or return the secret files materials and equipment without any backups it states This right is retained even after the agreement s five year term ends in October 2022 All documents are eligible for destruction under the agreement s broad language All cooperation shall be treated as confidential information by the parties the agreement states The directors of the maximum biocontainment labs in Wuhan and Texas announced a formal cooperative agreement in Science in 2018 The labs are two of just a handful of facilities in the world that do similar cutting edge work on novel coronaviruses The lab in Texas with funding from the National Institutes of Health was doing biosafety training with the lab in Wuhan which operates under the Chinese Academy of Sciences The labs also intended to do joint research projects and share resources according to the agreement The revelation that the Wuhan lab retained the right to call for the destruction of data on U S servers funded by U S taxpayers comes amid a debate about what sort of investigation is necessary to exculpate the city s coronavirus research from suspicions it sparked the COVID 19 pandemic It also raises questions about assurances from Wuhan Institute of Virology senior scientist Zhengli Shi that she would never delete sensitive data The clause also raises a number of legal red flags for the Texas lab experts say The clause is quite frankly explosive said Reuben Guttman a partner at Guttman Buschner Brooks PLLC who specializes in ensuring the integrity of government programs Anytime I see a public entity I would be very concerned about destroying records Guttman said that even private

China stating the labs will exchange the virus resources strictly for the scientific research purposes A number of clunky or unusual provisions in the agreement suggests it may have been drafted at least in part by Chinese partners and translated into English For example it states nothing in the agreement should be construed as establishing a relationship between master and servant unusual

the paper with one peer reviewer noting This is a timely commentary It is perfectly written I suggest to publish it right away In February 2020 EMI published two more commentaries all of which were favorable to the Chinese government s position on the origins of SARS CoV 2 a Feb 4 commentary titled HIV 1 did not contribute to the 2019 nCoV genome by U S based Chinese scientists with affiliations to Chinese universities and a Feb 28 commentary titled Is SARS CoV 2 originated from laboratory A rebuttal to the claim of formation via laboratory recombination by Shanghai based scientists belonging

raise questions about contagion risks for example of shipping of bats and rats infected with dangerous pathogens They also contain other noteworthy items including In February 2017 DoD coordinators of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency s Cooperative Biological Engagement Program announced a new global bat alliance to build and leverage country and regional capabilities to generate an enhanced understanding of bats and their ecology within the context of pathogens of security concern Associated with this the emails show a collaboration between CSU EcoHealth Alliance and the National Institutes of Health s Rocky Mountain Laboratories to build a bat research site at CSU to expand bat infection studies The global bat alliance evolved into a group called Bat One Health Research Network BOHRN By 2018 key BOHRN scientists were working with DARPA on a project called PREEMPT CSU records on PREEMPT show that Rocky Mountain Laboratories CSU and Montana State University are developing scalable vectored vaccines to spread through bat populations to prevent emergence and spillover of potential pandemic viruses from bats to human populations Their goal is to develop self disseminating vaccines which spread contagiously between bats in hopes of eliminating pathogens in their animal reservoirs before spillover into humans This research raises concerns about unintended consequences of releasing genetically engineered self spreading entities into the open and the ecological risks of their unknown evolution virulence and spread Shipping bats and rats infected with dangerous pathogens creates the potential for unintended spillover into humans Tony Schountz wrote to EcoHealth Alliance VP Jonathan Epstein on March 30 2020 RML Rocky Mountain Labs imported the Lassa

investigating By Carey Gillam Since the outbreak of COVID 19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 scientists have searched for clues about what led to the emergence of its causative agent the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 Uncovering the source of SARS CoV 2 could be crucial for preventing future outbreaks A series of four high profile studies published earlier this year provided scientific credence to the hypothesis that SARS CoV 2 originated in bats and then jumped to humans through a type of anteater called a pangolin among the world s most trafficked wild animals While that specific theory involving pangolins has been largely discounted the four studies known as the pangolin papers continue to provide support for the notion that coronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV 2 circulate in the wild meaning the SARS CoV 2 that caused COVID 19 probably comes from a wild animal source The focus on a wild animal source the zoonotic theory has become a critical element in global discussion about the virus directing public attention away from the possibility that the virus may have originated inside a Chinese governmental laboratory the Wuhan Institute of Virology U S Right to Know USRTK has learned however that two of the four papers that make up the foundation for the zoonotic theory appear to be flawed and that the editors at the journals in which the papers were published PLoS Pathogens and Nature are investigating the core data behind the studies and how the data was analyzed The other two similarly appear to suffer flaws The problems with the research papers raise serious questions and concerns about the validity of the zoonotic theory overall according to Dr Sainath Suryanarayanan a biologist and sociologist of science and USRTK staff scientist The studies lack sufficiently reliable data independently verifiable data sets and a transparent peer review and editorial process according to Dr Suryanarayanan See his emails with senior authors of the papers and journal editors and analysis Nature and PLoS Pathogens probe scientific veracity of key studies linking pangolin coronaviruses to origin of SARS CoV 2 Chinese governmental authorities first promoted the idea that the source of the causal agent for COVID 19 in humans came from a wild animal in December Chinese government supported scientists then backed that theory in four separate studies submitted to the journals between February 7 and 18 The World Health Organization s China Joint Mission Team investigating the emergence and spread of COVID 19 in China stated in February Since the COVID 19 virus has a genome identity of 96 to a bat SARS like coronavirus and 86 92 to a pangolin SARS like coronavirus an animal source for COVID 19 is highly likely The Chinese initiated focus on a wild animal source helped chill calls", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:usrtk.org_biohazards_coronavirus-origin-in-doubt.txt:0:f83a094b214c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx":

The two that are currently being investigated by the journal editors are Liu et al and Xiao et al In communications with the authors and journal editors of those two papers USRTK has learned of serious problems with the publication of those studies including the following Liu et al did not publish or share upon being asked raw and or missing data that would allow experts to independently verify their genomic analyses Editors at both Nature and PLoS Pathogens as well as Professor Stanley Perlman the editor of Liu et al have acknowledged in email communications that they are aware of serious issues with these papers and that the journals are investigating them Yet they have made no public disclosure of the potential problems with the papers The silence of the journals regarding their ongoing investigations means that wider communities of scientists policymakers and the public impacted by COVID 19 are unaware of the problems associated with the research papers said Dr Suryanarayanan We believe that these issues are important since they may shape how institutions respond to a catastrophic pandemic that has radically affected lives and livelihoods worldwide he said

Health and Human Services and National Library of Medicine On November 22 2022 USRTK filed a lawsuit against the U S Department of Health and Human Services and the National Library of Medicine for violating the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act It s common practice for researchers to compare potentially new genetic sequences to a database of known sequences using BLAST to determine if their sequence is novel or related to known sequences We sent a FOIA to the NIH to ask if any BLAST query inputs made before the start of the Covid 19 pandemic matched portions of the SARS CoV 2 genome Our request focuses on the RdRp and spike genes since these genes may have a greater chance of being sequenced The RdRp gene is often used to identify the presence of coronaviruses and for many coronaviruses only partial RdRp sequences are known The spike gene is of great research interest due to the role it plays in pathogenesis and viral transmission If someone was looking for a sequence that matches SARS CoV 2 before the pandemic began then that would suggest that a lab may have possessed a progenitor of SARS CoV 2 or a highly similar relative We sent our FOIA on June 1 2022 On June 9th the NLM replied that it has no responsive records On June 15th we appealed and asked some questions We did not receive a response Case 1 22 cv 03555 23 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency On

multimillion dollar bat coronavirus research grant funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH was made public last week revealing that researchers based in Wuhan China had manipulated coronaviruses in ways that led to increased severity of infection employing platforms that tested the ability of bat coronaviruses to use human receptors The grant documents underscore the perils of the collection of and experimentation on potentially pathogenic viruses and shed new light on U S funded coronavirus experiments in Wuhan China for five years prior to the COVID 19 pandemic The new information disclosed in the grant proposal and its interim reports do not establish that the research led to the pandemic But they do suggest that it was possible The NIH funded five year grant was awarded in 2014 to the U S based EcoHealth Alliance with EcoHealth President Peter Daszak as principal investigator in collaboration with several researchers in China including two working at China s Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV A key collaborator on the grant was Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina providing expertise in mouse models for coronavirus infections The grant was renewed in 2019 but then cancelled in 2020 as the pandemic set off panic around the globe A copy of the research plan and interim reports titled Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence was obtained through litigation against the NIH and publicly released by The Intercept The documents show that the NIH grant was for 3 1 million of which 599 000 went to the WIV and to researcher Zhengli Shi who specialized in the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 SARS CoV 1 and similar viruses called SARS related SARSr CoVs Many scientists have posited a possible lab origin of SARS CoV 2 and suggested the WIV as a possible source for the origin of the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 which causes COVID 19 Coronaviruses CoVs emerging from wildlife are a significant threat to global health the grant claims with bats considered a natural reservoir of these viruses With that in mind the authors said that the purpose of their research was to examine the risk of future coronavirus emergence from wildlife using a range of research techniques and to understand what factors increase the risk of the next CoV emerging in people The work involved screening more than 30 species of bats for CoVs and then developing strategies for assessing the potential spillover of coronaviruses from bats to humans according to the grant documents But it is possible that in seeking

close reading of the grant During fieldwork collection and containment of bat SARSr CoV samples people could have been accidentally infected The research involved collecting samples from bats in four Chinese provinces Yunnan Guangdong Guangxi and Fujian The researchers explained their prolific sampling of Chinese bats and identification of new coronaviruses We have identified sequences from 268 novel bat CoVs 140 from China alone they wrote in the grant We have an additional 5000 clinical samples from free ranging bats and rodents from Guangdong province The grantees acknowledged that their work had serious implications writing in the grant documents that some SARSr CoVs currently circulating in bats in southern China are likely able to infect and replicate within people Emphasis in original In fact the most closely related virus to SARS CoV 2 identified to date was found by WIV scientists in a mineshaft in Mojiang Yunnan Province In 2012 2013 six miners experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome after exposure to bat feces in this mineshaft and three died There is evidence of lax bat handling practices and minimal use of personal protective equipment PPE at WIV and Wuhan University where parts of the research were conducted By their own admission the researchers noted this work could be dangerous Fieldwork involves the highest risk of exposure to SARSr related or other bat CoVs while working in caves with high bat density overhead and the potential for fecal dust to be inhaled according to the grant documents The grant documents state that Tyvek suits and HEPA filtered Powered Air Purifying and Supplied Air Respirator Systems PAPRs will additionally be worn in cave systems where there is a higher risk of contact with aerosolized bat feces If any of those bat samples contained a close relative of SARS CoV 2 infectious to humans an accidental infection during the course of fieldwork subsequent lab procedures or containment could have led to a transmissible SARSr CoV with greater similarity to SARS CoV 2 than the currently reported strains In fact analysis of some early strains of SARS CoV 2 shows that they may be more similar to bat

researchers stated in the grant that they developed an in vivo model that is mice genetically engineered to carry human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 hACE 2 the receptor for SARS CoV 1 and SARS CoV 2 The research group also reported that they were successful in generating new SARS like coronaviruses They did this by splicing the RNA sequences of the novel spike proteins they discovered into the viral backbone of known lab strains This kind of novel virus is called a chimera because it consists of genetic elements from different viruses In this way the researchers created three chimeric viruses each with a different spike protein from bats Though the grant does not mention a virus similar enough to SARS CoV 2 to be a direct progenitor it is possible that other chimeric viruses were tested in this model but were not reported in the grant The researchers had access to troves of novel coronaviruses collected during fieldwork including unreported bat viruses It is common for researchers to present some but not all data in interim grant reports The research described in the grant established a platform that could have easily been used to study other chimeric viruses more closely related to SARS CoV 2 than those mentioned in the grant There are indications of this within the grant documents While results from infection of hACE 2 mice with three chimeric viruses were

the scientists explicitly reported on this is not the question but rather was a novel chimeric bat virus engineered that was also transmissible between hACE 2 mice While the grant does not discuss repeated passage of viruses in hACE 2 mice the platform also sets up biosafety concerns about this possibility A weakness in the prominent proximal origin paper Some scientists who have argued against a lab origin for SARS CoV 2 contend that the virus has a signature of it being adapted in an animal host with an intact immune system for which no such appropriate laboratory model has been described One of these arguments against a lab origin of SARS CoV 2 advanced by scientist Kristian Andersen and colleagues and published as an influential correspondence in Nature Medicine was s ubsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans but such work has also not previously been described Emphasis ours However the grant shows this is not correct the experimentation on the hACE 2 mice establish such a model Infection of hACE 2 mice with the novel chimeric bat coronaviruses could have supported new viruses with sequence changes that make them better able to infect human cells These could be more similar in sequence to SARS CoV 2 than the original chimeric virus infecting

explanation for how NIH funded research in China could have led to the COVID 19 pandemic The bottom line In addition to searching for spillover events the research outlined in the grant had the potential to generate a spillover event This could have occurred as an accidental infection during fieldwork and laboratory handling of bat SARSr CoVs during containment or storage of them or during the laboratory engineering of novel chimeric bat coronaviruses or after these novel viruses were used to infect hACE 2 mice leading to a more infectious transmissible and or pathogenic virus that was a precursor to SARS CoV 2 The possibility of a lab leak or lab acquired infection with any of these novel coronaviruses during lab experimentation raises serious biosafety concerns Though the bat coronavirus grant project has concluded it is entirely possible that other studies using this platform were performed or are now being performed including those related to viral transmission It is noteworthy that it took civil litigation to bring these grant documents to light even though the research itself was paid for by U S taxpayers It is also noteworthy that EcoHealth Alliance has received nearly 40 million in multiple grants from the Department of Defense and DOD grant data is often considered classified and withheld from the public And though the 5 year bat coronavirus research grant was only renewed for one additional year a 7 5 million NIH grant titled Understanding Risk of Zoonotic Virus Emergence in EID Hotspots of Southeast Asia was awarded to EHA in 2020 to expand on the platforms established in the 2014 grant This newer grant with Daszak again as principal investigator was also made public last week by the Intercept The new grant is a consortium grant that adds more collaborators and lab sites where the research will be performed including a BSL 4 facility in Boston Funding is approved for the budget cycle of June 17 2020 through May 31 2025 The bottom line is this It is unclear whether the work performed under the 2014 bat coronavirus NIH grant played a role in the COVID 19 pandemic But the EcoHealth Alliance and WIV collection and storage

that SARS CoV 2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin was shared widely in the scientific community By the end of 2020 it had been downloaded 75 000 times and was the third most popular article in

review and accept basically no review the JEO Journal Editorial Office of T F became very suspicious and wanted her boss to check and approve Su replied Thanks for speeding it up bro Frightening to think it may have been engineered An important part of the debate over the origin of SARS CoV 2 is the existence of a furin cleavage site FCS at the junction between the SARS CoV 2 spike protein domains S1 and S2 SARS CoV 2 belongs to a group of viruses known as betacoronaviruses lineage B The FCS however does not appear in any of the other coronaviruses in this group One argument in support of the lab origin hypothesis is that the FCS within the SARS CoV 2 spike protein could be a result of laboratory manipulation The EMI commentary does not address the existence of the FCS even though it is widely considered one of the strongest pieces of evidence of lab engineering Evidence supports the importance of the FCS in the ability of SARS CoV 2 to infect human cells and tissues Engineering FCS within coronaviruses is a well known practice in coronavirus research labs Email exchanges between the co authors show that though their commentary did not address the issue they

researchers have pointed out that it rests upon contradictory observations that require further investigation For further reading on these topics see our reading list What are the origins of SARS CoV 2 What are the risks of gain of function research Some scientists have suggested a different hypothesis of origin they speculate that the SARS CoV 2 is the result of an accidental release of a wild type or lab modified strain of a closely related SARS like virus that had been stored in biosafety facilities conducting coronavirus research in Wuhan such as the WIV or the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Importantly a lab origin scenario does not necessarily exclude the zoonosis hypothesis because SARS CoV 2 could be the outcome of lab modifications conducted on unreported versions of SARS like bat coronaviruses stored in WIV or merely collection and storage of such coronaviruses Critics of lab origin hypotheses have dismissed these ideas as unsubstantiated speculations and conspiracy theories To date there is not sufficient evidence to definitively reject either zoonotic origin or lab origin hypotheses We do know based on published research articles and U S federal grants to the EcoHealth Alliance for funding WIV s coronavirus research that WIV stored hundreds of potentially dangerous SARS like coronaviruses and performed GOF experiments on coronaviruses in

at BSL3 where many more exist and standards are varied Franz wrote back to Le Duc I also mentioned the issue you raise about a focus on 4s both because they tend to be taken more seriously by governments possibly making them safer and more secure than 2s or 3s and also that the 2s and 3s are generally more vulnerable than 4s Biosafety level BSL designations were established in the mid 1970s Biosafety labs are designated BSL 1 to BSL 4 with 4 as the most stringent in practices and containment of potential pathogens In the U S the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the NIH establish BSL designations Pathogen Level P lab 1 to 4 designations are used interchangeably with BSL BSL 2 labs include biosafety cabinets with HEPA filtration where experiments are performed providing lab researchers protection from infectious agents according to the biosafety manuals of the CDC and Boston University Personal protective equipment PPE including lab coats gloves and eye protection as well as decontaminating procedures are standard BSL 3 labs have additional biosafety measures particularly to protect against agents with respiratory transmission routes these include full gowns or Tyvek suits face shields and additional risk based protections such as ventilation devices which may differ depending on the agent being used BSL 3 labs require negative pressure and a specialized anteroom so that agents will be contained within the lab even in the case of an accidental spill or contamination and have more extensive HEPA filtration systems BSL 4 facilities have been a focus of biosafety discussions because the most deadly and dangerous pathogens such as Ebola and Marburg viruses are studied there BSL 4s have more custom designed containment and stricter requirements including mandatory use of positive pressure space suits and dedicated nonrecirculating ventilation systems In EHA led work conducted in Wuhan scientists infected humanized mice with engineered novel bat coronaviruses in a BSL 3 facility according to grant documents EHA submitted to the NIH Some collection and engineering of bat coronaviruses were done in a BSL 2 with less stringent protocols and containment according to multiple sources including a paper in the Journal of Virology I think we need to remember that a lot of the work especially on coronaviruses has been done presumably at BSL3 wrote Le Duc In the NIH funded EHA grant proposal there was ambiguity as to where the humanized mouse infections would be performed While many biosafety details were specified

PFAS are a group of thousands of manufactured chemicals widely used by a range of industries and commonly found in a large number of consumer products One common characteristic of PFAS is that they persist in the environment and can accumulate in humans and animals For this reason they are often referred to as forever chemicals Some PFAS have been linked to cancer birth defects liver disease thyroid disease decreased immunity hormone disruption and a range of other serious health problems Most people in the United States have been exposed to some PFAS according to the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The chemicals have been documented in the blood of people and animals around the world and have been found to be pervasive in the environment particularly in areas where manufacturers or other industrial users are actively handling PFAS In response to a Freedom of Information Act request the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA in 2021 released a spreadsheet of more than 120 000 facilities around the U S that may be handling PFAS Download that spreadsheet here Researchers have identified the following routes of exposure to PFAS Drinking water in public drinking water or tap water systems and private drinking water wells Soil and water at or near waste sites at landfills disposal sites and hazardous waste sites Firefighting foam used in training and emergency response events at airports shipyards military bases firefighting training facilities chemical plants and refineries Manufacturing or chemical production facilities that produce or use PFAS

The New Yorker 5 20 24 Nine Takeaways From Our Investigation Into 3M s Forever Chemicals What you need to know about the inside story of how the company allowed PFOS to seep into all of us while sitting on research that showed the chemical is toxic ProPublica A 2023 review paper in the Annals of Global Health based on previously secret industry documents archived at the UCSF Chemical Industry Documents Library examines strategies of corporate manipulation of science used by manufacturers of PFAS The review shows that companies knew that PFAS was highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested by 1970 forty years before the public health community The research establishes that the industry used several strategies that have been shown common to tobacco pharmaceutical and other industries to influence science and regulation most notably suppressing unfavorable research and distorting public discourse See CBC article Industry knew about risks of PFAS forever chemicals for decades before push to restrict them Long history of warnings about health risks of PFAS Environmental and human health experts and advocates have long been critical of the EPA for a lack of research into and regulation of PFAS Researchers lawyers and environmental and human health advocates have warned about the dangers of PFAS for roughly 20 years and evidence has come to light showing that companies involved in manufacturing PFAS have known even longer about dangers to human health Research has demonstrated that two types of PFAS Perfluorooctanoic Acid PFOA and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate PFOS are very harmful to humans and animals In 2016 the National Toxicology Program NTP concluded that PFOA and PFOS were a specific hazard to immune system function in humans U S manufacturers have been replacing those types of PFAS with other types though concerns persist about the replacements On Nov 16 2021 the EPA said it was sending four draft documents to its Scientific Advisory Board that contain new data and analyses The new information indicates that negative health effects may occur at much lower levels of exposure to PFOA and PFOS than previously understood and

non stick Teflon products C8 was originally manufactured by 3M and then by DuPont until the health hazards of the chemical were made public through a class action lawsuit A replacement chemical called GenX was introduced by DuPont in 2009 as a safer alternative to PFOA but an investigation by The Intercept found that DuPont filed 16 reports with the EPA citing numerous harmful health effects of the chemical on animals sparking concerns about the safety of the substitute A C8 science panel was formed as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit approved in February 2005 by West Virginia Circuit Court That case involved allegations that human health problems were caused by releases of C8 from a DuPont facility in West Virginia The science panel was charged with conducting a community study to help evaluate potential links between C8 exposure and any human disease The research findings are detailed here The litigation and settlement were largely the work of U S lawyer Robert Bilott Bilott has spent the last two decades advocating for strict PFAS regulation and corporate accountability for PFAS pollution His investigation into PFAS including the corporate efforts to cover up harm

enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful PFAS chemicals and 1 billion in funding to address PFAS in drinking water According to the press release Exposure to PFAS has been linked to deadly cancers impacts to the liver and heart and immune and developmental damage to infants and children The final rule will reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people prevent thousands of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious illnesses The final rule announced in April represents the most significant step to protect public health under EPA s PFAS

drinking water standards for two PFAS chemicals and will go back to the drawing board the Guardian reported in August 2024 WHO is conducting an entirely new review of scientific literature and disbanded the panel of scientists who developed the draft guidelines It established a new panel with fewer industry linked scientists and more regulatory officials moves that have not happened in other revisions said Betsy Southerland a former EPA manager in the agency s water division reported Tom Perkins This is unprecedented but the WHO got unprecedented criticism Southerland said Independent scientists charged that the WHO drinking water standards for PFAS were too weak ignored credible research did not fully protect human health and were far above limits set by regulators in

in rats It is a complete carcinogen having both initiating and promoting activities for the development of renal cell tumors In a 1986 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Japanese researchers separated rats into several groups and gave them various doses of potassium bromate for 104 weeks Afterward the animals were autopsied and examined histopathologically The researchers found that the animals given the highest dose had the lowest survival time And the combined incidences of renal adenocarcinomas and adenomas were significantly increased in rats treated in the groups given the three highest doses of the additive They also found that the group treated with the highest dose the combined incidences for follicular adenocarcinomas and adenomas of the thyroid and for mesotheliomas of the peritoneum were shown to be significantly increased In a 1983 study published in the Journal of National Cancer Institute researchers gave groups of rats different concentrations of potassium bromate in drinking water and examined survival rates The group given the highest concentration had the shortest survival time Researchers observed high rates of renal cell tumors in the groups given the highest doses of potassium bromate along with mesotheliomas of the peritoneum in males given the highest dose The tumor incidences in the test groups were significantly higher than those in the control group The researchers concluded When orally administered under the conditions of this experiment potassium bromate was carcinogenic to F344 rats In a 2018 study

animal studies show that the consumption of potassium bromate can induce such an imbalance in the body In a study published in the journal Toxicology in 2006 researchers examined the contribution of oxidative stress in potassium bromate induced cancers The scientists fed rats drinking water with multiple concentrations of potassium bromate for 2 to 100 weeks and then analyzed gene expression on kidney thyroid and mesothelial cell RNA They found families of mRNA transcripts differentially expressed with respect to bromate treatment included multiple cancer cell death ion transport and oxidative stress genes The researchers concluded These results suggest that carcinogenic doses of potassium bromate require attainment of a threshold at which oxidation of tissues occurs and that gene expression profiles may be predictive of these physiological changes in renal homeostasis In a 2019 study published in the journal Toxicology and Industrial Health researchers investigated the effects of perinatal potassium bromate exposure on the development of sensorimotor reflexes and redox status and on the histological architecture of the brain liver and kidney of newborn mice They separated pregnant mice into two groups one of which was given from 5 days gestation to 21 days postnatal water with dissolved potassium bromate The other was the control group and given uncontaminated drinking

Neurobehavioral changes In a 2016 study published in the journal Behavioral and Brain Functions researchers investigated the effects of potassium bromate on the brain function of albino mice by grouping them into three groups a control group a group that was administered a low dose of the oxidizing agent and a third group that was administered a high dose While researchers observed body weight changes in the high dose group they also observed neurobehavioral changes and a reduction of neurotransmitter levels in both the low dose and high dose group Glutathione levels also decreased in both groups The researchers concluded These results show that potassium bromate has serious damaging effects on the central nervous system and therefore its use should be avoided Disrupts

powder that is used as an oxidizing agent lab reagent and food additive As a food additive it is known as E924 and is used to strengthen dough improve texture and enhance the volume and appearance of baked goods It is one of the most inexpensive flour improvers in the baking industry and when used properly in food potassium bromate reduces to the nontoxic byproduct bromide in the baking process Problems arise if baking conditions are incorrect for example the item is baked at a low temperature or too much potassium bromate is added and potassium bromate residues persist in the final baking product In countries where it is still permitted regulations often specify maximum residual limits for potassium bromate in finished baked goods These limits are intended to ensure that the level of residual potassium bromate is within acceptable safety margins The U S FDA currently permits 0 0075 parts potassium bromate for every 100 parts by weight of flour used in food preparation and products As a food additive it appears on ingredient lists as potassium bromate or bromated flour Grandfathered into GRAS Potassium bromate was first patented for use in baking in 1914 and went on the market soon after At the time there were no regulatory agencies in the United States to oversee the safety of food additives in consumer goods When the Food Additive Amendments of 1958 was enacted out of concern for the health risks of chemicals in the food supply this required new additives to be determined as generally recognized as safe or GRAS before going to market But if food additives like potassium bromate were already on the market they were not required to be reassessed and simply grandfathered into the GRAS categorization Journalism Calif Gov Newsom signs first in US toxic food

that the exposure produced mild to moderate changes in the cytoarchitecture of brain tissue in a time dependent manner Furthermore Comet assay revealed the apoptotic DNA fragmentation while PCR SSCP pattern and direct sequencing showed point mutation of Presenilin 1 gene at exon 5 gene linked to inherited forms of Alzheimer s disease The researchers wrote From these findings the present study concluded that TiO2NPs is genotoxic and mutagenic to brain tissue which in turn might lead to Alzheimer s disease incidence For research published in 2022 study in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology scientists examined the genotoxicity and the intracellular reactive oxygen species induction by physiologically relevant concentrations of three different TiO2 nanomaterials in Caco 2 and

Inflammation of the intestines Animal studies have shown that when consumed as a food additive titanium dioxide can induce intestinal inflammation In a 2019 study published in the journal Nanotoxicology researchers recreated the first phase of digestion in mice and fed them titanium dioxide then examined whether accumulation occurred in the organs Researchers wrote Significant accumulation of titanium was observed in the liver and intestine of E171 fed mice in the latter a threefold increase in the number of TiO2 particles was also measured Titanium accumulation in the liver was associated with necroinflammatory foci containing tissue monocytes macrophages Three days after the last dose increased superoxide production and inflammation were observed in the stomach

Chemistry in 2019 sought to examine the effects of titanium dioxide on intestinal inflammation Researchers did this by feeding rats titanium dioxide nanoparticles and found that after the course of two to three months the animals had lower body weights and induced intestinal inflammation The researchers also found the nanoparticles altered gut microbiota composition and aggravated chronic colitis The rats also experienced reduced populations of CD4 T cells which are cells that help organize immune responses by prompting other immune cells to fight infection regulatory T cells and white

inflammation and overproduction of toxic amyloid beta peptides which are key markers of Alzheimer s Disease This study sheds light on how exposure to these particles might increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the need for strategies to mitigate their impact on brain health Scientists analyzed research that examined how titanium dioxide nanoparticles interact with the brain for a 2015 review published in Nanoscale Research Letters The researchers wrote Once the TiO2 NPs are translocated into the central nervous system through certain pathways they may accumulate in the brain regions For their slow elimination rates those NPs could remain in the brain zones for a long period and the Ti contents would gradually increase with repeated exposure After reviewing dozens of studies the scientists concluded Long term or chronic exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles could potentially lead to the gradually increased Ti contents in the brain which may eventually induce impairments on the neurons and glial cells and lead to CNS dysfunction as a consequence For research published in Archives of Toxicology in 2020 scientists fed one group of mice a solution containing titanium dioxide for one month and compared it to those that did not receive the additive They found the richness and evenness of gut microbiota were remarkably decreased and the gut microbial community compositions were significantly changed in the titanium dioxide group when compared with the control group The tests also revealed that the titanium dioxide exposure could cause locomotor dysfunction or mobility issues by elevating the excitement of enteric neurons which might spread to the brain via gut brain communication by vagal pathway The researchers concluded These

obesity related metabolic disorders For a review published in 2023 in the journal Environmental Pollution researchers examined E171 as a possible factor promoting obesity related metabolic disorders Because gut microbiota play an important role in immune function maintenance and development and because titanium dioxide as a food additive has been shown to alter gut microbiota researchers wanted to review the dysregulations along the gut microbiota immune system axis after oral TiO2 exposure compared to those reported in obese or diabetic patients and to highlight potential mechanisms by which foodborne TiO2 nanoparticles may increase the susceptibility to develop obesity related metabolic disorders The study authors discovered recurrent changes in the gut microbiota composition when exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles with an imbalance of intestinal symbiotic microbiota These changes and imbalances were also reported and played a role in the development of obesity the authors wrote This highlights foodborne TiO2 nanoparticles as an endocrine disruptor like chemical promoting obesity related disorders the authors concluded Colorectal tumors and preneoplastic lesions

dioxide and its nanoparticles can impact alter and or damage important protective bacteria in the gut along with the metabolic pathways of gut bacteria The tiniest particles of titanium dioxide can raise blood sugar levels and impair how the body processes glucose among other health harms according to new research in mice published May 2025 in Food and Chemical Toxicology These findings raise important questions about the potential risks of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in food products particularly in relation to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes the researchers say Titanium dioxide nanoparticles appear to interfere with how the gut senses nutrients from food in the body and how it produces and releases key hormones involved in digestion and blood sugar level

titanium dioxide nanoparticles to the bacterial strains Metabolomics analysis showed that TiO2 NPs caused alterations in multiple metabolic pathways of gut bacteria such as tryptophan and arginine metabolism which were demonstrated to play crucial roles in regulating gut and host health The researchers also found that four different neuroprotective metabolites were significantly reduced in

in vivo and affect the spatial distribution of commensal bacteria in vitro by promoting biofilm formation We also found reduced expression of the colonic mucin 2 gene a key component of the intestinal mucus layer and increased expression of the beta defensin gene indicating that titanium dioxide significantly impacts gut homeostasis The changes were then linked to colonic inflammation along with a higher expression of inflammatory cytokines which are signal proteins that help with regulation The researchers concluded that titanium dioxide impairs gut homeostasis which may in turn prime the host for disease development In a small study published in the European Journal of Nutrition in 2020 researchers examined the effects of several food additives including titanium dioxide along with artificial sweeteners and cleaning products by testing the fecal samples of 13 people Titanium dioxide was among the samples that induced significant shifts in microbiome community structure The

research published in 2020 in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology showed that E171 promoted anxiety and induced adenomas or noncancerous tumors in the colon They also found that E171 heightened goblet cells hypertrophy and hyperplasia which is typically seen in asthma patients and triggered by smoking or external pollutants and toxins They also noted mucins overexpression in the mice which can be linked to cancer cell formation Breathing problems in offspring In a study published in 2022 in the journal Particle and Fibre Technology researchers examined the impact of maternal exposure to

underlining the importance of conducting in vivo studies using both male and female animals Second human exposure begins in utero via maternal fetal transfer and continues after birth by breastfeeding Children are then chronically re exposed due to their food preferences To be relevant to the human in vivo situation experimental studies should therefore consider nanoparticle exposure with respect

effects of nanomaterials on human health and the environment In general nanoparticles have been shown to accumulate in the body particularly in organs in the gastrointestinal tract along with the liver spleen and capillaries of the lungs Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are commonly found in a wide range of consumer goods including cosmetics sunscreens paints and colorings ceramics glass textiles construction materials medicine food food packaging and more In Europe cosmetic companies are required to label products that contain nanoparticles In the U S companies are not In 2017 French researchers from the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique INRAE were among the first to examine the effects of E171 nanoparticles on the body They fed rats a dose of 10mg of E171 per kilogram of body weight per day which was similar to human exposure in food The research which was published in Scientific Reports showed that E171 was able to traverse the intestinal barrier pass into the bloodstream and reach other areas of the body in rats Researchers also found a link between immune system disorders and the absorption of titanium dioxide nanoparticles Titanium dioxide nanoparticles have also been found in human placentae and in infant meconium indicating its ability to be transferred from mother to fetus A 2012 study published in the journal Environmental Science Technology noted that children are especially exposed to titanium dioxide because of the food that contains the food additive and is particularly marketed to children including candy and cakes Recent policy

and strengthened methods we could not rule out a concern for genotoxicity and consequently we could not establish a safe level for daily intake of the food additive FDA s response Following the EU s ban on E171 the Food and Drug Administration FDA told the Guardian that based on current evidence titanium dioxide as a food additive is safe The available safety studies do not demonstrate safety concerns connected to the use of titanium dioxide as a color additive Currently titanium dioxide as a food additive is classified as GRAS or generally recognized as safe The FDA has not updated its general guidance on safety assessments since 2007 Within that time there has been a significant increase in research on the confluence of toxicology nanotechnology and human health The EU updates its guidance regularly with new science available to offer proper safety assessments with its most recent update published in 2021 As for titanium dioxide the FDA approved titanium dioxide for use as a food additive in 1966 The last time the agency reviewed the additive s safety according to the Guardian was in 1973 States looking to ban titanium dioxide as a food additive In 2023 California and New York proposed banning several food additives that are banned in Europe but legal in the United States Titanium dioxide was among the five proposed to be banned but in September the additive was removed from the list of additives from the California ban list Australia and New Zealand review of TiO2 In 2022 a year after the EFSA recommended against the use of E171 the Food Standards Australia New Zealand FSANZ conducted its own reassessment of titanium dioxide as a food additive The agency concluded that titanium dioxide was indeed safe to use as a food additive The United Kingdom and

three Chinese labs including the Wuhan Institute of Virology may have violated Texas state law in a new statement to U S Right to Know U S Right to Know revealed earlier this year that Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB signed a legal agreement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology that called for any so called secret files produced under their collaboration to be deleted at the request of either lab Any and all research data resulting from the collaboration could be destroyed under the contract experts said Now UTMB has revealed that the Galveston lab drafted legal agreements with two other labs the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and the Institute of Medical Biology in Kunming containing the same provision empowering each to ask the other party to destroy any files and any backup files The Institute of Medical Biology in Kunming which recently certified its maximum biocontainment lab had apparently not yet signed the agreement All cooperation and exchanges sic documents data details and materials shall be treated as confidential information by the parties the provision reads The party is entitled to ask the other to destroy and or return the secret files materials and equipment without backups Given global interest in whether an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology sparked the COVID 19 pandemic the confidentiality provision prompted concerns that valuable information about China s coronavirus research could have been lost But UTMB said that the Galveston lab has never destroyed records and that its Chinese partners never demanded that records be destroyed UTMB said that its collaborations never resulted in any financial engagement such as grant funding or joint patents and that the labs never conducted joint research on coronaviruses The

Photo credit Unsplash American researchers concealed their intention to conduct high risk coronavirus research in Wuhan under lax safety standards from the Pentagon the year before the COVID 19 pandemic according to documents obtained by U S Right to Know A 2018 grant proposal called Project DEFUSE coauthored by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and American scientists has stoked concern that the pandemic resulted from a lab accident It proposed engineering high risk coronaviruses of the same species as SARS and SARS CoV 2 Most worrying to some scientists The proposal involved synthesizing spike proteins with furin cleavage sites the same feature that supercharged SARS CoV 2 into the most infectious pandemic pathogen in a century Indeed some scientists have likened DEFUSE to a blueprint for generating SARS CoV 2 in the lab New documents obtained by U S Right to Know now show that these experiments were proposed to occur in part in Wuhan with fewer safety precautions than required in the U S apparently to save on costs American scientists at the center of the lab leak theory controversy appear to have concealed this from their desired funder the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in order to evade any national security concerns about doing high level biosecurity work in China The documents call into question the credibility of these scientists assurances that the pandemic could not have sprung out of their collaboration on coronavirus engineering research with the lab in Wuhan U S Right to Know has obtained an early draft of DEFUSE with comments from PD and

Peter Daszak I m planning to use my resume and Ralph s Daszak wrote Linfa Zhengli I realize your resumes are also very impressive but I m trying to downplay the non US focus of this proposal so that DARPA doesn t see this as a negative In addition to the national security risks conducting coronavirus engineering and testing work in Wuhan entailed greater biosafety risks the American researchers privately acknowledged The Wuhan Institute of Virology has conducted research on SARS related coronaviruses like SARS CoV 2 in biosafety level two BSL 2 conditions Biosafety levels range from one BSL 1 to four BSL 4 with BSL 4 being the most stringent BSL 2 labs involve ventilated biosafety cabinets with researchers in surgical masks and lab coats Many scientists say viruses that may be transmitted through the air should at minimum be studied in BSL 3 conditions with ventilation and with researchers in more protective respirators An early draft of DEFUSE acknowledged that the engineering and testing of novel coronaviruses would occur at BSL 2 The proposal advertised this approach to DARPA grantmakers as highly cost effective But BSL 2 was edited to BSL 3 In a comment on the document Baric acknowledged that U S researchers would freak out if they knew the novel coronavirus engineering and testing work would be conducted in a BSL 2 lab In the US these recombinant SARS

plausibly have led to the genetic engineering and accidental release of SARS CoV 2 BSL 2 experiments are more convenient and less expensive than BSL 3 experiments However BSL 2 provides a far lower level of biosafety than BSL 3 does This lower safety level is especially dangerous for experiments involving viruses that can be transmitted by air Kinney said It is very concerning that Daszak and Baric appear to have considered it legitimate to move high risk experiments from BSL 3 to BSL 2 It is also concerning that they appear to have considered doing so in secret instead of disclosing this important change of experimental plans and biosafety precautions in their grant proposal The formal DEFUSE proposal states under risk mitigation that experimental work using bats and of transgenic mice will be conducted at the BSL 3 level in WIV Duke NUS UNC or USGS National Wildlife Health Center without specifying an institution It does not appear to mention the biosafety level in which high risk research in cell lines will be undertaken DARPA rejected the DEFUSE proposal despite the scientists apparently whitewashing the national security and biosecurity dangers The documents obtained by U S Right to Know suggest the gain of function work of concern was not funded before the grant submission in 2018 However questions remain about whether the work was subsequently completed without the DARPA funding Daszak has insisted that the experiments proposed in DEFUSE were never carried out The DARPA proposal was not funded Therefore the work was not done Simple Daszak said last year However Daszak had the ability to push forward with research without funding when a separate National Institutes of Health grant was halted an email obtained by U S Right to Know shows A progress report for

should also be held accountable for those decisions he told MIT Technology Review in 2021 If you study hundreds of different bat viruses at BSL 2 your luck may eventually run out But Baric did not disclose his own foreknowledge and apparent complicity in the Wuhan lab s lax biosafety standards While Shi was included in the email chain and addressed in Daszak s comments on the draft proposal it s not clear whether Baric ever brought up the issue of biosafety levels directly with Shi or anyone else at the Wuhan Institute of Virology I would like to know if Baric had concerns about the risky live virus experiments being redistributed to labs operating at potentially low biosafety once funding was awarded said Alina Chan a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute Seeing as how Baric recently described the pangolin SARS like virus as an optimal model for introducing a furin cleavage site into is he at all worried that his collaborators might have carried out the experiments in DEFUSE independently of him and at lower biosafety Daszak s apparent effort to deceive DARPA fits a pattern of nondisclosure around the DEFUSE proposal Despite its potential relevance to the origins

Kristian Andersen would observe privately in February 2020 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci who had endorsed gain of function research and whose institute had helped underwrite the collaboration between EcoHealth Alliance UNC and the Wuhan Institute of Virology asked in February 2020 whether certain experiments could have led to the evolution of SARS CoV 2 He asked whether a technique called serial passage in which successive infections speed up evolutionary changes had been conducted in mice engineered to express human receptors called ACE2 Baric had shared transgenic mice expressing ACE2 the receptor that both SARS and SARS CoV 2 bind to with the Wuhan Institute of Virology Surely that wouldn t be done in a BSL2 lab asked Francis Collins then

pandemic While virologists agree none of the Wuhan lab s known viral backbones are progenitors of SARS CoV 2 a key question is whether unknown coronaviruses identified in wildlife may have been studied there and whether that data may be accessible through records kept by its American partner A central disagreement between scientists who favor the natural origin theory and scientists who worry about a lab accident is whether SARS CoV 2 traveled hundreds of miles from Southeast Asia to the metropolis of Wuhan China due to virus hunting or due to the wildlife trade EcoHealth Alliance Malaysian Project Coordinator Tom Hughes said in an email that all of the coronaviruses identified by the team have been shared in another database called GenBank Hughes shared the unique identifiers for PCR fragments of coronaviruses identified by PREDICT in Malaysia between May 2016 and August 2020 Still the IDEEAL app s unavailability follows a pattern of opacity about data on the part of

according to their private emails Leaders of the National Institutes of Health in the United States and the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom played an undisclosed role in persuading virologists to

Columbia University virologist Ian Lipkin wrote on February 11 2020 that an early draft of the article does not eliminate the possibility of inadvertent release following adaptation through selection in culture at the institute in Wuhan citing a nightmare of circumstantial evidence at the Wuhan lab The new congressional memo shows for the first time that Holmes wrote on February 11 2020 that he agreed with Lipkin s assessment even after he had drafted the first version of the article that would dispel the lab leak theory Holmes also said he had concerns about how quickly the virus had emerged in humans apparently without detection in a likely zoonotic reservoir in contrast to the SARS epidemic It is indeed striking that this virus is so closely related to SARS yet is behaving so differently Seems to have been pre adapted for human spread since the get go Holmes said The proximal origin article nodded to the fact that SARS CoV 2 appeared pre adapted to humans But scientists who have stated that SARS CoV 2 appeared pre adapted to humans in more straightforward terms and who left open the possibility that the adaptation had occurred in the lab have received fierce backlash

Republicans have sought answers about whether the private teleconference with powerful funders of scientific research on February 1 2020 had an improper influence The virologists have rebutted that claim in part by pointing to the emergence of data in China describing coronavirus data suggesting a highly similar receptor binding domain in pangolins around the same time they were drafting the article Pangolins are highly trafficked in China though rarely sold live in wet markets But the new congressional memo suggests that Andersen the article s lead author did not find that the pangolin data alone provided sufficient evidence in favor of a natural origin The newly available pangolin sequences do not elucidate the origin of SARS CoV 2 or refute a lab origin Andersen said in an email on February 21 2020 T here is no evidence on present data that the pangolin CoVs are directly related to the COVID 19 epidemic Congressional investigators state in the memo that given the pangolin data was apparently not the compelling evidence in favor of a natural origin theory the factor that likely pushed the scientists toward the natural origin theory was undue influence by Collins Fauci and Farrar The pangolin data was not the compelling factor the memo reads To this day the only known intervening event was the February 1 conference call with Dr Fauci Meanwhile Stanley Perlman a University of Iowa virologist who edited one of the papers describing the pangolin coronavirus data said that the new congressional memo has not changed his stance in favor of a natural origin However

after the grant was retracted Daszak s email generates questions about NIH oversight of grantees conducting research with pandemic risks An audit published last week by the inspector general overseeing health programs uncovered several deficiencies in NIH s oversight of EcoHealth His email also seems to contrast with his public statements that work on the grant came to a halt without funding The grant was suspended during the Trump administration after questions began to swirl about the group s work on SARS like viruses at the pandemic s epicenter The suspension generated several headlines in the mainstream press Many reports suggested political motivations behind the suspension and highlighted its unpopularity in the scientific community When asked by the journal Nature how he planned to continue work on the discontinued grant Daszak gave a murky answer The NIH have told us not to work on this project Obviously we re not going to break any NIH rules Daszak said suggesting that he would not do any further work on the discontinued grant However he then followed up with But we have an ongoing collaboration So we need to carry on with that work Asked about his

isolated novel live viruses would then be used to infect humanized mice or SARS susceptible animals like ferrets Most of this work was to be done at the Wuhan lab The grant renewal further proposed to isolate and test SARS like coronaviruses that were most likely to spillover as well as evade therapeutics The main targets for this portion of the project were coronaviruses whose spike proteins were 10 to 25 percent different from that of the SARS spike protein The spike protein of SARS CoV 2 falls within this range According to the proposal to renew the grant which was written in 2018 the researchers did not have any coronaviruses whose spike proteins fit the target profile They said they would begin sampling for these viruses toward the end of the first year of the renewal which was

Wikimedia Commons Updated 12 3 24 2 05 p m A sprawling final report by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic provokes questions over whether some in the scientific community including EcoHealth Alliance the American nonprofit that collaborated on novel coronavirus discovery and engineering research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its president Peter Daszak could face criminal charges stemming from the COVID 19 tragedy The report s findings the culmination of two years of work by congressional investigators the review of more than one million documents and dozens of transcribed interviews and public hearings include evidence that Daszak misled the committee on questions central to the COVID 19 origins mystery Daszak exported gain of function coronavirus experiments to China shirked his duty to probe his Wuhan colleagues for lab notebooks viral samples and genomic data and helped to falsely persuade millions that the idea of a Wuhan lab leak was a conspiracy theory the committee s investigation shows Daszak did not immediately respond to a request for comment In May 2024 the committee s investigation helped spur the Department of Health and Human Services to initiate debarment proceedings against EcoHealth and Daszak The debarment process is not yet finished but could result in EcoHealth and Daszak being ineligible for federal funding for a period of years But the new revelations spur the possibility of criminal charges related to the COVID 19 pandemic as well namely making false statements or perjury Among the report s most striking revelations the Department of Justice empaneled a criminal grand jury to investigate potential federal crimes related to the origins of COVID 19 The status of this grand jury investigation is not public Though the DOJ dragnet ensnared EcoHealth neither the nonprofit nor Daszak are the target of the DOJ investigation EcoHealth s attorney told the committee A February 2023 email indicates that EcoHealth stayed mum on numerous nonpublic investigations The only thought is whether to skip for the time being reference to our other government inquiries the email reads Especially on the Executive Branch front where the DOJ grand jury investigation seems so far to remain nonpublic I think it would be better just to say we re acting as promptly as possible under the circumstances

Several of President elect Donald Trump s nominees for appointed positions have made the issue a priority in recent years Secretary of State Marco Rubio Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr Amid speculation that some in Trump s orbit will push for legal accountability for former longtime National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci an influential champion of gain of function research and whose NIAID underwrote the U S China collaboration on coronaviruses the report asserts that the coronavirus experiments under scrutiny indeed qualify as gain of function research contradicting Fauci s sworn congressional testimony to the contrary Report reveals Daszak and Fauci misled the committee Daszak agreed to testify truthfully in a November 2023 transcribed interview and under oath at a May 2024 congressional hearing but made multiple misstatements the report shows Claim Daszak Well there was a little bit said about DARPA declining to fund this including people who have said that they declined it because of biosecurity concerns Absolutely not true Fact check An EcoHealth research grant proposal dubbed DEFUSE pitched generating novel SARS related viruses with a uniquely infectious feature called a furin cleavage site at a critical juncture on the spike protein called the S1 S2 boundary SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 is the only SARS related coronavirus with a furin cleavage site which is situated at the S1 S2 boundary generating questions about whether the intellectual property in the proposal laid the groundwork for the COVID 19 pandemic The sought after funder for DEFUSE the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA rejected the proposal in 2018 Daszak insisted for years that the project was rejected because of just a little miff around resource limitations and not because of the steep risks that the proposed research would generate novel pandemic pathogens Well there was a little bit said about DARPA declining to fund this including people who have said that they declined it because of biosecurity concerns Daszak said Absolutely not true Daszak claimed to have notes from a meeting with DARPA corroborating this but never supplied them to the committee But DARPA Program Manager Jim Gimlett who

for DEFUSE directly contradicted Daszak s claim Gimlet told the committee the rejection stemmed from a lack of due care for rules governing pandemic potential pathogens The research team didn t address or basically just denied that they had to address gain of function because it didn t fall under any of the regulatory requirements he said The EcoHealth led research team has denied that its coronavirus work qualified for more rigorous review under gain of function rules in part because it worked with bat coronaviruses related to SARS rather than SARS or other viruses known to infect humans Even if it s a bat virus it could have risks Gimlett said refuting that idea These concerns were summarized in a memo leaked in 2021 and confirmed to be authentic by Gimlett The team s approach does potentially involve gain of function dual use research of concern research they aim to synthesize spike glycoproteins which bind to human cell receptors and insert them into SARSr CoV backbones to assess whether they can cause SARS like disease the memo reads Claim Daszak We were locked out of the system Fact check Daszak submitted a progress report on the NIAID grant that underwrote his research collaboration on novel bat coronaviruses with the Wuhan Institute of Virology the report describing the period from June 2018 through May 2019 nearly two years late in August 2021 when an enormous incentive existed not to report experiments that could reflect poorly on EcoHealth or the WIV When pressed on the delay Daszak claimed it was due to technical difficulties We were locked out of the system Daszak said in a transcribed interview However an internal NIH forensic audit made public for the first time in the congressional report shows that Daszak accessed the eRA system used to submit reports on 72 days in between the report s due date and its submission nearly two years later Perhaps the most publicly debated testimony was that of Fauci the former head of NIAID and a champion of gain of function research Claim Fauci I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement This paper that you were referring to was judged by qualified staff up and

dangerous enhanced pandemic potential pathogen gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology Rep Debbie Lesko R Ariz asked I m saying no because I ve said no multiple times Fauci responded tersely By contrast several experts confirmed to the committee that the coronavirus experiments under scrutiny met the definition of gain of function research Although the definition of gain of function research was removed from the NIAID website it was described as recently as 2021 as a type of research that modifies a biological agent so that it confers a new or enhanced activity to that agent Both NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence Tabak and coronavirologist Ralph Baric the architect of many of the coronavirus experiments under dispute confirmed the work qualified as gain of function research Is it a gain of function phenotype Absolutely You can t argue with that Baric said Dr Fauci s testimony was at a minimum misleading the report reads Witness testimony and a plain reading of EcoHealth s research conducted at the WIV using U S taxpayer dollars confirm it facilitated an experiment that conveyed new or enhanced activity to a pathogen thus satisfying the definition of gain of function research Daszak avoided lab leak talk with Zhengli Shi Before the COVID 19 pandemic EcoHealth had marketed its research as valuable for distinguishing between natural and lab borne pathogens and as pivotal for gaining a foothold into labs in China and its allied countries Yet after the COVID 19 pandemic emerged in the same city as his partnering lab Daszak brushed off demands to obtain lab notebooks viral samples and genetic sequences from the Wuhan Institute of Virology even though the experiments were underwritten by U S funding Daszak expressed indignation at demands from

Zhengli Shi Paradoxically while flouting requests for information about the research in Wuhan from NIH Daszak allegedly stressed to his funders at NIAID that it was important for a suspended grant to be reinstated in order to obtain viral samples from Wuhan according to the report When push came to shove Daszak told congressional investigators that the samples were likely to remain in the Wuhan

Pentagon about planned research to generate new coronaviruses with furin cleavage sites a genetic motif shown to make viruses more transmissible SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 is the only sarbecovirus with a furin cleavage site A formal research proposal submitted by Daszak and Shi in 2018 stated that this research would occur in the U S in a biosafety level three lab a relatively rigorous level But private drafts indicated this language was designed to placate grantmakers at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and that key tests would in fact occur in Wuhan at a biosafety level two lab an inadequate biosafety level apparently to save on costs What Fauci knew Fauci has dismissed the relevance of this research to the worst pandemic in a century He falsely claimed in Senate testimony in 2021 that NIAID did not fund gain of function research in Wuhan In an interview last year with Australian media Fauci downplayed the significance of NIAID s funding to EcoHealth and its collaborators in Wuhan But emails obtained through FOIA show that Fauci was alerted by January 27 2020 that his institute had funded among the biggest players in coronavirus work namely EcoHealth Alliance and its collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology Fauci had been alerted by February 1 2020 that this research included gain of function experiments In the very

US Right to Know show The never before published analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency DIA points out that the lab in question the Wuhan Institute of Virology was highly capable of genetic manipulation and includes an assessment that the genome of the coronavirus strain that caused COVID 19 is consistent with the hypothesis that it was a lab engineered virus that escaped from containment The analysis by scientists in the DIA which is charged with collecting and analyzing medical and health intelligence as part of its operations also concluded that the virus that became known as SARS CoV 2 could have come from a bank of bat coronaviruses in the Wuhan lab that was under the research of senior virologist Dr Shi Zhengli Guards stand at the entrance of the Wuhan

this story Shi who also did not respond to interview requests previously denied in news reports that her lab held the virus strain that caused the pandemic The DIA has not publicly recognized the analysis as its official position on the matter But unlike other federal assessments that provide few details to back up their findings that COVID 19 likely emerged from a lab the DIA assessment offers the most detailed U S agency scientific analysis made public to date supporting why such a conclusion was drawn The DIA analysis appears to be the work of reputable government scientists whose findings made during the first months of the pandemic were kept secret while a competing hypothesis that COVID 19 emerged by natural means gained traction and became widely accepted The slides are

acknowledged assessments concluding that COVID 19 could have emerged from a lab though most intelligence agencies assess that the virus likely occurred naturally by passing from an infected animal to a human Neither scenario has been disproved In the DIA s unpublished analysis scientists noted that researchers at the Wuhan lab were performing the types of experiments that could lead to the creation of a virus like SARS CoV 2 sometimes under inadequate safety conditions that could not prevent a highly transmissible virus from escaping While the authors of the analysis are not identified

possesses a genetic feature that helps make it highly transmissible to humans called a furin cleavage site Scientists have long known that these sites can make viruses more infectious and they have a history of adding them to viruses in the lab The big question is did the site in SARS CoV 2 evolve naturally or through experimentation in the lab The Proximal Origin authors argued that the site in SARS CoV 2 probably arose naturally through the same evolutionary processes that create furin cleavage sites in influenza They also discounted the possibility that the site in the novel coronavirus

influenza and other coronaviruses with natural furin cleavage sites they found that the site in the pandemic virus had a far different genetic makeup The analysis does not explain this difference only stating that the site in SARS CoV 2 does not appear to be inserted via the same mechanism that drives influenza insertions The DIA analysis pointed out that Chinese researchers including those at the Wuhan lab had already inserted furin cleavage sites into coronaviruses In fact the lab s researchers and their American collaborators proposed a project in 2018 that appeared to plan to insert cleavage sites into coronaviruses at the same spot where it exists in the genetic sequence of the virus that caused COVID 19 The analysis also discounted a paper that the Proximal Origin authors appeared to cite as the evidence that swayed them to conclude that COVID 19 arose naturally This paper reported the discovery of a new SARS CoV 2 relative called RmYN02 that seemed to have a small section that partially resembled the furin cleavage site in SARS CoV 2 But the DIA analysis suggested that RmYN02 might actually be a red herring This site didn t have the components necessary to make a functional furin cleavage site and the analysis suggests that it was located in a different spot that was near but not the same as the site in the novel coronavirus The discovery of other close SARS CoV 2 relatives in 2021 appeared to confirm the DIA scientist s suspicions This meant that SARS CoV 2 remained the only virus among close relatives to have a furin cleavage site inserted in its spike protein the key feature that likely made the virus capable of unleashing a pandemic A fast and easy way to make coronaviruses A central argument in Proximal Origins is that SARS CoV 2 could not have

analysis also points out that the Wuhan lab has a large bank of Bat Coronaviruses and that most of the sequences have not been published They proceed to show two different ways that the novel coronavirus could have been constructed using a type of engineering called Golden Gate Assembly a method the Wuhan lab had the knowledge experience and resources to use One way could have used a curious feature of the virus s genome two restriction sites that are spaced at a distance along the genome that could be useful for cloning These sites called BsmBI and BsaI are commonly used in reverse genetics Both had previously been used by the Wuhab lab to create chimeric coronaviruses which are hybrids pieced together from sections of different coronaviruses A preprint published in 2022 showed that the distances between the BsmBI and BsaI sites in SARS CoV 2 are indeed unusual and extremely unlikely in wild coronaviruses and nearly universal in synthetic viruses The second way uses invisible restriction sites that would leave no trace of genetic manipulation The DIA analysis cites a May 2020 University of Texas publication which demonstrates how quickly virologists could synthesize an infectious SARS CoV 2 clone using such invisible restriction sites Cutlip and Chretien s working paper even stated that several labs had synthesized SARS CoV 2 within weeks of its genome being published Both construction strategies would have been compatible with a fast and cheap reverse genetics method published by the Wuhan lab in 2016 where mutations could easily be introduced into coronaviruses A lab made hybrid The analysis shows that the DIA scientists suspected SARS CoV 2 could be a chimeric or hybrid virus because its spike protein appeared to be stitched together from two different viruses Most of the spike protein is nearly identical to the spike of another bat coronavirus called RaTG13 which was previously found by Wuhan lab researchers However one small region called the receptor binding domain was nearly identical to a coronavirus carried by pangolins the animals sometimes called spiny anteaters This small section helps determine which species a coronavirus can infect The DIA scientists appeared concerned that this could be a sign of genetic engineering because the size and location of the pangolin like region correspond to a region that scientists in the Wuhan lab found could convert a coronavirus that infects bats into one that infects humans The DIA analysis also stated that the DNA for the pangolin like receptor binding domain

virus could easily be confused with a natural recombinant and mentions suspicion that the Chinese government released fabricated studies to mislead the public about the pandemic s origin The DIA analysis also questions how a pangolin virus could naturally recombine with a bat virus found 800 miles away and noted that Wuhan scientists gathered samples from locations where both viruses were found and brought them back to the Wuhan lab Two years after the DIA analysis scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France discovered multiple bat coronaviruses in Laos whose spike proteins including the receptor binding domains were highly similar to the novel coronavirus However none had a furin cleavage site That finding weakened the argument that SARS CoV 2 could be a lab made hybrid because it showed that the region that appeared to come from pangolins could naturally occur in bat coronaviruses But before the discovery the DIA scientists could not dismiss the idea that the novel coronavirus was a hybrid virus created in the Wuhan lab where scientists had the knowledge capabilities and experience to create such viruses Lax biosafety standards at the Wuhan Institute of Virology The DIA analysis pointed out that scientists in the Wuhan lab conducted experiments with live SARS like coronaviruses under biosafety level 2 conditions which would make an accidental release of an infectious bat coronavirus more likely Known as BSL2 such safety standards are typically used for moderate risk organisms that have a low risk of infecting people through the air More stringent standards BSL3 and BSL4 are used for pathogens that are more lethal or that can transmit easily through the air like SARS CoV 2 The analysis also noted that Chinese labs have had a history of virus escapes from BSL2 laboratories The escaped viruses include SARS which escaped Chinese labs four times and SARS CoV 2 which appears to have infected a Beijing lab worker early in the pandemic Numerous

interest in the years immediately before the pandemic to generate viruses that share the unique features of SARS CoV 2 A virus expedition and engineering proposal named DEFUSE first reported by the independent research group DRASTIC in 2021 lays out what some scientists have likened to a blueprint for generating a virus like SARS CoV 2 Daszak dismissed DEFUSE as utterly irrelevant to the origins of COVID emphasizing that DEFUSE was rejected by the intended funding agency DARPA But pressed by the committee Daszak conceded he never asked if his collaborators in Wuhan moved ahead with the work independently DEFUSE shows the collaboration s interest in a feature called a furin cleavage site specifically furin cleavage sites in a position on coronavirus spike protein called the S1 S2 junction SARS CoV 2 is unique among viruses in its family for its furin cleavage site at the S1 S2 junction Asked whether experiments with furin cleavage sites were performed either in Wuhan or UNC Daszak answered no However some ambiguity remains about the nature of EcoHealth s work in the months before the pandemic s start EcoHealth submitted its report detailing research and experiments funded by an NIH grant from June 2018 through May 2019 due in September 2019 nearly two years later after the pandemic had already begun Wenstrup said in a media interview that some of the work outlined in DEFUSE

Wuhan Institute of Virology according to two NIAID aides Director of the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Emily Erbelding told the committee in a transcribed interview that she believed Daszak said he had access to viral samples as he sought reinstatement of his NIAID grant Daszak disputed that attributing it to a conflation of the words sequences and samples and stated that a condition of the reinstatement of the grant was that EcoHealth would no longer do on the ground work in China Daszak testified that Chinese authorities denied EcoHealth s request to remove these samples In a statement EcoHealth claimed that the sequences of the Wuhan viruses described in Daszak s email had all been made public in a 2020 paper Latinne et al But after being pressed by the Subcommittee Staff Director Mitch Benzine Daszak conceded the paper s methodology only included virus sampling expeditions up to the year 2015 and that the lab had likely done more sampling since then

of function because the animal viruses haven t spilled over yet given the premise of EcoHealth s work is to discover viruses poised to spillover before they do much of the group s work would be

Act show Emails between Daszak and University of North Carolina virologist Ralph Baric another collaborator of the laboratory at the pandemic s epicenter offer new behind the scenes insights into Daszak s influence Baric s experiments with the Wuhan lab included gain of function experiments to make viruses more transmissible or virulent The White House was dissuaded from investigating the possibility of a lab origin of COVID 19 in part by discussions that included both Daszak and Baric according to a March 2020 email written by Daszak And in a separate May 2020 email Daszak told Baric that he used talking points intended to discourage reporters from asking questions about potential gain of function work on coronaviruses Daszak has been a vocal proponent of a natural origin of COVID 19 EcoHealth Alliance has worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and received millions in government funding to discover and study animal viruses Though the public does not have a complete picture of the pre pandemic work underway none of the viruses published by EHA or the WIV could have directly sparked the COVID 19 pandemic These new revelations add to the evidence of Daszak s central role in shaping public perceptions about COVID 19 s origins He secretly organized a statement in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet deeming a lab origin a conspiracy theory He served

opinion and prevent NASEM committees from delving into possible lab origins I don t think this committee will be getting into the lab release or bioengineering hypothesis again any time soon White House seems to be satisfied with the earlier meeting paper in Nature and general comments within the scientific community Daszak told Baric After more evidence in favor of a lab origin emerged

everything extremely clear to reporters about the way this all happens he said He first recommends saying that gain of function research issues have already been resolved by the NIH That s already been debated extensively and decided on by NIH Daszak suggests telling reporters NIH hosted a debate among scientists about the limits of gain of function research in the years before the pandemic New

Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic which has been investigating an American research organization at the center of suspicions that the COVID 19 pandemic may have resulted from a lab accident in Wuhan The hearing follows an announcement Wednesday that this organization EcoHealth Alliance helmed by President Peter Daszak has had its federal funding suspended and could be on track to be debarred from federal funding for years The enforcement action stems from EcoHealth s failure to adequately oversee the research it subcontracted to the Wuhan Institute of Virology This research included experiments that made SARS related coronaviruses more dangerous Daszak testified before the committee earlier this month EcoHealth s research was underwritten by NIAID placing Fauci and his aides in the spotlight too The scrutiny of EcoHealth and NIAID has revealed that Daszak had a close connection to Fauci s inner circle in the senior advisor to the NIAID director David Morens Morens told the committee in a transcribed interview that Daszak is one of his oldest friends Now evidence has surfaced suggesting that Morens evaded the Freedom of Information Act which requires that records from federal agencies be made public with limited exceptions and that an unidentified public records official with the NIH helped him to do so NIH and NIAID did not immediately reply to request for comment Morens boasted about the ability to make emails disappear even after a FOIA request had been submitted according to the committee The emails were revealed in questions by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer R Ky Dr David Morens a senior advisor to Fauci for decades wrote in an email to Dr Daszak I learned from our FOIA lady here how to make emails disappear after I am FOIA d but before the search starts So I think we are all safe Plus I deleted most of those earlier emails after sending them to Gmail Comer said Thursday Is that consistent with NIH document

origins Photo credit Unsplash Testimony from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Senior Scientific Advisor David Morens a longtime aide to former NIAID Director Anthony Fauci only deepened congressional concerns about the possibility of concealed or destroyed emails concerning connections between the institute and the Wuhan Institute of Virology A memo and over 150 emails released by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Wednesday show that Morens spent considerable time and energy avoiding the Freedom of Information Act a law that requires federal agency records to be provided to the public on request with limited exceptions Morens deleted sensitive emails conducted official business on a private email account and worked with an NIAID administrator in the Freedom of Information Office to strategically misspell keywords that the public might request to be searched the committee alleges Morens sought to conceal emails in which he championed his close friend EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak a scientist who subcontracted NIAID funding to the lab in Wuhan for experiments that made coronaviruses more deadly Morens said that he and Daszak met twenty years ago and were part of the same close knit fraternity among emerging infectious diseases experts The subpoenaed emails make clear that Morens repeatedly advocated for EcoHealth and Daszak from within Fauci s inner circle serving as an intermediary between Daszak and Fauci and often using his private Gmail account to shuttle messages One email released by the committee suggests that Fauci himself may have subverted public records requests through use of a personal email account bypassing official channels I can either send stuff to Tony on his private email or hand it to him at work or at his house Morens emailed on April 21 2021 He is too smart to let colleagues send him stuff that could cause trouble Other emails show Morens and Daszak

government officials knew as early as February 2020 that the emerging novel coronavirus that causes COVID 19 had already been well adapted to humans an early signal not only that it would spread efficiently but also that it may not have emerged at the Wuhan wet market Recently released chat messages indicate that former National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci was informed by early February 2020 by then China Center for Disease for Disease Control and Prevention Director George Gao that the emerging novel coronavirus had already adapted to human hosts well SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 first emerged in humans almost preternaturally suited to spread in humans without having to evolve in the population much some scientists say Some scientists say this points to an emergence of the virus earlier than the December outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and that the virus became well adapted by circulating cryptically in people or that the virus that was adapted to human cells in a laboratory using a common technique called serial passage in which viruses evolve through sequential infections in animals or cells In part because of the implications for the origins of the virus discussion of the preadapted nature of the virus was mired in controversy The new messages suggest that two of the world s most prominent scientists were privately discussing this topic in the pandemic s earliest days though its implications were not discussed much publicly until they were raised months later by a far less prominent scientist Broad Institute molecular biologist Alina Chan Fauci and Gao spoke in early February according to messages obtained and recently released by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic The messages were exchanged on WeChat a Chinese instant messaging and social media app The call was arranged by Ping Chen who served as a representative of Fauci s NIAID in the U S Embassy in Beijing Chen had just returned to National Institutes of Health headquarters in Bethesda Maryland by the time the pandemic began Another message from Chen to Gao apparently reflecting back on the call appears to shed light on their discussion Dear George as the world is dealing with the highly transmissible SARS 2 delta variant I have never forgotten what you said to ASF on the phone call in early Feb 2020 Chen wrote in apparent reference to Anthony Stephen Fauci You said although we don t know much about the new coronavirus one thing you do know is the new virus adapted human host well I

19 pandemic failures Chen and NIAID declined to comment Fauci and Gao did not respond to emailed requests for comment Competing papers In the pandemic s earliest days though Fauci was apparently privy to the well adapted nature of the virus this information was not relayed to the public It was not until approximately three months later on May 21 2020 that this alarming characteristic of the novel coronavirus starkly different than the SARS virus that circulated from 2002 2004 first generated widespread discussion and debate in the U S with the publication of a preprint titled SARS CoV 2 is well adapted for humans What does this mean for re emergence SARS CoV 2 appeared without peer in late 2019 suggesting that there was a single introduction of the human adapted form of the virus into the human population the preprint read Unlike the original SARS virus which picked up dozens of beneficial mutations in the early days of infecting people SARS CoV 2 only had a single beneficial mutation The virus could have circulated undetected or have been adapted to human cells in a laboratory the authors postulated Even the possibility that a non genetically engineered precursor could have adapted to humans while being studied in a laboratory should be considered regardless of how likely or unlikely it stated The conclusion made headlines but many virologists expressed skepticism Chan in particular who was vocal on Twitter eventually became the target of opprobrium from prominent virologists who dismissed concerns about a lab accident as the makings of a conspiracy theory Critics included authors of an earlier March 2020 publication in Nature Medicine titled The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 While this paper acknowledged the virus was well adapted to humans it

to express alarm at the possibility that SARS CoV 2 arose through this method Fauci had been alerted by a group of scientists that the virus appeared inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory in other words lab made Fauci had requested a group of virologists examine the data Fauci assigned another aide NIAID Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss to investigate NIH connections to the research In his message to Auchincloss he sent a link to the Nature paper coauthored by Baric mentioned in the Jan 27 email Baric had shared mice engineered to express ACE2 with the Wuhan lab This

promised to lean on influential contacts including former NIH Director Harold Varmus Foundation for the National Institutes of Health President Maria Freire and Research America President Mary Woolley to vouch for him Keusch s lab was set to be a collaborator on EcoHealth s EIDRC project grant documents show The acronym EIDRC or alternatively CREID stands for Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Center EcoHealth was being considered as one of just 11 of these multimillion dollar projects across the country Daszak had good reason to tread carefully A formally binding term of award for his new EIDRC project had not yet been issued by the time Building One came knocking According to the NIH website an NoA or notice of award is the official grant award document notifying the recipient and others that an award has been made Daszak conceded the project could just quietly disappear before any funding was guaranteed I am also very concerned that Trump could target our organization or me

here at EcoHealth but knowing that you re all out there working in the background and that Tony s speaking truth to power is extremely important a slight relief in a tough week Daszak wrote to Morens on May 7 2020 At a June 23 2020 congressional hearing when Fauci was asked about the grant being terminated he did not defend the decision by others within NIH to seek data from Wuhan He simply stated it was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it in an apparent allusion to Trump Three days later House Democrats addressed a letter to HHS expressing concern about the termination of EcoHealth s grant citing press reports and Fauci s testimony to characterize the grant s jeopardy as part of a wider provocation of China by the Trump administration In early 2021 Daszak briefed NIAID and may have briefed Fauci directly another email indicates on the World Health Organization commissioned international mission to China Daszak had advanced the conclusion that a lab leak in Wuhan was extremely unlikely as the only American citizen on the team bringing him into conflict with the World Health Organization Director General Adhanom Ghebreyesus Tedros who argued the possibility had been ruled out prematurely without evidence But NIH officials outside of NIAID continued to ask EcoHealth about the Wuhan lab into the summer and fall of 2021 Daszak dragged his feet That year the issue of a possible connection between NIAID and the pandemic s origin became more salient because of a series of high profile Senate hearings in which Paul questioned Fauci about it Morens apparently ferried information from Daszak to Fauci about efforts in Congress to investigate the pandemic s origins In an October 24 2021 email Daszak asked Morens for input on a response to a letter from Lauer

Stemmy is really important and being sure he is well informed acknowledges the communications you mention and is on board because he will certainly be questioned the email reads He also suggested that you discuss with him that when you were aware that it was necessary to file the 5 year report the system shut you out and you presumed that was normal process as you were then into grant year 1 In other words Fauci s aide Morens after speaking with Fauci advised Daszak to confer with Stemmy on his explanation for the late progress report Daszak has said that there was a technical glitch so EcoHealth decided to forgo the final year s report given some of this information had been reported in an application for an extension of the grant Stemmy denied speaking to Daszak to advise him on responses to Lauer in a congressional interview More of the same It was obvious to Fauci s inner circle at NIAID that the new CREID grant mirrored EcoHealth s prior work just the sort of research that had alarmed the public and the White House in the first place Morens described the CREID endeavor to Folkers Fauci s chief of staff as PREDICT on steroids PREDICT was the name of EcoHealth s grant

2022 But he s left our organization as a daily target for conspiracies with death threats media attacks and legal actions against us All this began when he decided not to stand up to political interference in NIH funding under Trump Daszak appears to have expressed no such resentment against Fauci to whom he had a line through Morens Daszak put pressure on Collins to restore his prior NIAID

Keusch told Daszak he would contact about his grant denouncing the grant s suspension After the story published Collins wrote to Varmus linking to an article describing NIH s pressure on EcoHealth

Lauer s records to investigate Building One The resulting story faulted an activist group for having tapped into partisan politics to make big problems for Fauci over the EcoHealth grant beginning in April 2020 when Fauci had first become privately concerned about NIAID connections to Wuhan two months prior Other stories in the mainstream press also portrayed the termination of the grant as strictly political and scientifically unsound Despite Daszak s ire Collins was publicly dismissive of the idea that the pandemic could have resulted from EcoHealth s research in Wuhan Under Collins s direction NIH apparently did not respond in detail to congressional questions about its efforts to obtain more information from EcoHealth When congressional Democrats asked for details about EcoHealth

natural spillover Unbeknownst to the public the March 2020 editorial in Nature Medicine Fauci cited to downplay the lab origin theory The proximal origin of SARS Cov 2 had been prompted in part by him

February 1 2020 about a preprint authored by Zhengli Shi director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases The preprint described bat coronaviruses under study at the lab including a coronavirus 96 percent genetically similar to the coronavirus that causes COVID 19 The emails show that Collins and Fauci were concerned about links between the Wuhan Institute of

similarities Obviously we need more details Fauci replied a little before noon Some details of the short exchange are redacted The email shows that these concerns were top of mind at a critical time About two hours after the email exchange Collins and Fauci would join a secret teleconference with a group of virologists who were closely examining the novel coronavirus The teleconference touched off a high profile push to discredit the lab leak hypothesis The revelation that Collins and Fauci were discussing whether NIH had funded work on coronaviruses similar to SARS CoV 2 at the Wuhan lab in the hours before suggests that politics may have been at play Those virologists claims that the virus could not have been engineered may have been influenced by Collins and Fauci The NIH leaders

deliberations were apolitical An analysis that framed the teleconference was called Coronavirus sequence comparison 1 pdf This document has apparently not been released to the public so it s not clear

while Collins had concluded that NIH did not support that particular study the agency had indeed funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology for coronavirus work including the engineering of chimeric viruses that combine components of multiple viruses to make them more infectious to human cells Fauci had been alerted days before that his institute the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases supported a virus hunting nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance with a grant called Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence and that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was a collaborator according to an email shared with U S Right to Know by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform Their concerns might have been aggravated further when lead authors of The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 shared concerns that the genome of SARS CoV 2 appeared inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory The virologists concerns about features of the virus that appeared engineered were shared with Collins and Fauci on January 31 2020 and again on February 2 RaTG13 The preprint authored by Shi about viruses related to SARS CoV 2 including RaTG13 would eventually be

RaTG13 was found after independent researchers uncovered this information despite RaTG13 being named something else in the earlier literature stoking suspicions of obfuscation In August 2020 Collins

practically on the doorsteps of that lab we did not have folks from other parts of the government raising their hands to educate the non experts in fact the folks from other parts of the government that worked these issues were deflecting Feith said The Department of Energy which includes the U S national labs recently changed its assessment of the pandemic s origin to favor a lab origin with low confidence but the details of that new intelligence have also not been publicly shared The witnesses also detailed how leaders of the National Institutes of Health and top virologists were hostile to the idea of a lab origin hindering fledgling investigations into that theory Emails obtained by journalists demonstrate that Francis Collins director of the NIH and Anthony Fauci head of NIH s infectious diseases institute harbored concerns about coronavirus virology in Wuhan in early 2020 especially in light of NIH funding for the work They never relayed these concerns to Ratcliffe who was confirmed in May 2020 None of the information from the Coronavirus Task Force was consistent with what the intelligence showed Some of those individuals which do include Dr Fauci were referring to it

BSL 2 level far lower than the BSL 4 level required for many pandemic potential pathogens According to Ratcliffe some scientists who briefed intelligence officials said that an intermediate host would soon be identified But virologists still haven t yet been able to identify strong zoonotic evidence especially as it relates to unusual aspects of the virus not seen in other SARS like coronaviruses

In late April 2020 the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unusual statement that the intelligence community concurred with the wide scientific consensus that the virus was not engineered a statement that appeared to echo the conclusions of the Feb 3 and March 26 briefings A majority of the views now is that it was natural it was organic said Defense Secretary Mark Esper In fact a scientific consensus on this matter did not exist then and does not exist now Even so the idea that SARS CoV 2 could not be engineered also found its way into the 90 day review that the intelligence community concluded in August 2021 Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS CoV 2 probably was not genetically engineered however two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way the declassified assessment reads U S Right to Know obtained documents reported in this article through Freedom of Information Act requests to the

By Emily Kopp and Karolina Corin The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified intelligence related to the origins of the worst pandemic in a century Friday evening The 10 page intelligence brief far from settles one of the most complex scientific questions of our time instead demonstrating gaps in our understanding of the COVID 19 tragedy more than three years after the deadly novel coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan Congress unanimously passed a bill in March to compel the intelligence community to release intelligence related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV That bill explicitly requested intelligence related to three things the Wuhan Institute of Virology researchers who became sick in the fall of 2019 connections between the Wuhan lab and the People s Liberation Army and research at the lab that enhanced coronaviruses The brief did not offer any information beyond that mandate including possible intelligence about other coronavirus labs in the city or the intelligence that persuaded some agencies the virus has a natural origin The brief does not appear to include new intelligence but rather select details about intelligence that the U S government has had for more than two years The brief appears to fall short of the law which called for the intelligence community to declassify and make available to the public as much information as possible about the origin of COVID 19 The report confirms that the lab grappled with biosafety problems and conducted research on similar viruses But the intelligence community also takes pains to say that it has no hard evidence of SARS CoV 2 or a progenitor being present in the lab before December 2019 or of a biosafety breach The brief confirmed that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is capable of seamlessly engineering new coronaviruses It also states that the People s Liberation Army conducted biodefense work there Wuhan Institute of Virology Senior Scientist Shi Zhengli has for years been among the world s experts in SARS related viruses earning the nickname the Batwoman for her propensity to prospect novel bat coronaviruses in remote caves She falsely assured the public in 2020 that

Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing in an unsuccessful bid to reestablish military to military communications amid escalating US China tensions ODNI finally released its report on June 23 2023 A lot of information relevant to the intelligence community s assessment appears to be missing The brief does not appear to include the evidence undergirding the Department of Energy s DOE updated assessment in favor of a lab origin The brief does clarify that the DOE and the FBI assess a lab origin likely for different reasons The brief states that the Central Intelligence Agency has not made an assessment There are no specifics on how the intelligence community made its assessment as to whether the virus is engineered The report states that all agencies assess the virus was not developed as a bioweapon Almost all agencies assess that the virus was not engineered Most agencies assess that the virus was not adapted in a lab like through serial passaging a method to make viruses more pathogenic without engineering But no confidence level or underlying evidence is provided Later in the report the brief states that the Wuhan lab was capable of seamless engineering An

incinerate viral samples or transfer them to government approved labs The lack of samples from the pandemic s earliest days has reportedly hindered the intelligence community s ability to assess the origin Sick WIV researchers Though required by the COVID 19 Origins Act of 2023 ODNI s report declined to name the sick WIV researchers or describe their symptoms In the days leading up to the deadline to declassify intelligence documents leaks from anonymous government officials alleged that three WIV coronavirus researchers were among the first people to be infected with SARS CoV 2 Ben Hu Yu Ping and Yan Zhu They deny getting sick The recent news about so called patient zero in WIV are absolutely rumors and ridiculous Hu told Science The report alleges that the researchers were not hospitalized for their condition but rather were mildly ill were tested in annual health exams as part of their duties in a high containment biosafety laboratory and that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is likely to still have the results of their blood tests While they had symptoms consistent with COVID 19 they were presumably not severe enough to require hospitalization or a CT scan which could have detected ground glass opacities an early signal of COVID 19 before tests existed This fact may contribute to why the intelligence community has found that their condition is not diagnostic about the origins of the virus The report stipulates that it s not clear whether the researchers were studying live viruses immediately before the pandemic s start But it is clear that the researchers named by journalists were indeed working with live viruses A review of their publications shows that these researchers studied coronaviruses with some of the same characteristics as SARS CoV 2 like the ability to infect human cells via the ACE2 receptor Some work was done with the aid of U S funding and included ties to EcoHealth Alliance One researcher Hu was even named in a DARPA proposal that

eventually publicly discount the possibility We will not stop the surveillance carried out for bat coronavirus Hu said in a 2017 interview There is a need to investigate whether unknown strains of SARS like coronaviruses that pose a potential threat to public health are also present in other bat caves in Yunnan or in other provinces Both Ben Hu and Yan Zhu were among the researchers who coauthored the paper that first identified SARS CoV 2 and its close relative RaTG13 in January 2020 setting off alarm bells among top virologists and National Institutes of Health leaders Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci They also studied a related clade of viruses but the genomes of some of these viruses only became available after the COVID 19 pandemic began generating questions about the integrity of this data They were also co authors on a paper that isolated WIV1 another virus that served as the backbone for gain of function experiments that have generated concerns Experiments on WIV1 done in collaboration with U S partner EcoHealth Alliance led to the unexpected enhancement of the virus lethality and pathogenicity The viral load increased by 10 000 times Coronavirus research at the WIV included pangolins Grant reports and peer reviewed publications make clear that the Wuhan Institute of Virology with the aid of U S funding conducted research that made coronaviruses more

report states A 2017 dissertation by a WIV student showed that reverse genetic cloning techniques left no traces of genetic modification of SARS like coronaviruses Yet the intelligence brief was missing a lot of information that has become public since the novel virus emerged from Wuhan Not mentioned The enormous database of SARS related viruses hosted by the Wuhan Institute of Virology that became hard to access in September 2019 and was ultimately taken offline Another omission from the brief The leaked grant proposal submitted by the EcoHealth Alliance to the Pentagon that shows that they planned to perform exactly the kinds of gain of function experiments that could lead to the synthesis of SARS CoV 2 The leaked proposal shows interest in adding cleavage sites to the spike protein which scientists knew should make viruses more infectious Poor biosafety standards at the WIV The report confirms that WIV researchers probably did not use adequate biosafety precautions when handling SARS like coronaviruses Many SARS like coronaviruses have spike proteins that are capable of infecting humans directly While SARS is considered a select agent and is typically handled according to BSL 3 standards the report states that experiments on SARS like coronaviruses were performed in BSL 2 laboratories which could have made accidental infections more likely The brief echoed State Department cables stating that the WIV did not have enough staff trained to work in high containment laboratories and confirmed that the WIV did not have a transparent process to decide which pathogens should be handled in those labs According to the ODNI report an inspection of the WIV BSL 4 lab noted aging equipment insufficient disinfectant equipment and inadequate ventilation systems Yet because the evaluation was performed in 2020 the report states that it cannot be used to infer the WIV s biosafety status before the pandemic began The WIV also began to make biosafety

Sierra Leone and Guinea field sampling staff will not be going back into the field anytime soon due to budget reductions and shift in scope In December 2017 and again in July 2018 Andrew Clements suggested that funds were running low in Sierra Leone and Guinea In August 2018 Elizabeth Leasure the Financial Operations Manager at the One Health Institute stated that all Ebola funded countries are on track to spend out by Sept 2019 and that Cameroon the final country managed by Metabiota had sufficient funds that could be moved to other countries Not much love for Metabiota Metabiota seems to have incurred a poor reputation that made collaborations difficult A series of emails from April 2017 show that UC Davis was sorting out major administrative issues with Metabiota at the moment and did not want to partner with them on future projects When discussing potential data platforms for the Global Virome Project in 2019 Eddy Rubin admitted that Joe Dirisi co president of Chan Zuckerberg BioHub has had bad interactions with Metabiota in the past and does not want to work on something linked to Metabiota During the Sierra Leone transition to UC Davis management in June 2017 Brian Bird wrote that the CDC was happy UCD is in charge and that there was not much love for MB Metabiota either from the CDC deputy country director Even in 2014 the WHO Ebola coordinator suggested withdrawing WHO staff from the outbreak epicenter to avoid getting a bad reputation from Metabiota Metabiota replaced its CEO in April 2017 when the PREDICT country transition discussions began and again in July

accident could cause a pandemic is nearly zero over the time scale of the five to ten decades it is difficult to acknowledge the possibility that a GOF research related accident already may have

caused the pandemic it is even harder Ebright also criticized government officials who have funded gain of function work over the years including outgoing National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci Fauci has encouraged gain of function research as the longtime director of the NIH s infectious disease institute and funded coronavirus work performed in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology Some of this funding was found to be out of compliance with NIH s own policies And for public officials who through negligence or misfeasance violated federal

whether SASR CoV 2 bears markers of pre pandemic genetic engineering techniques Photo credit NIAID By Karolina Corin and Emily Kopp COVID 19 s genome shows signs consistent with genetic manipulation according to a new preprint The preprint released last week argues that SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 may have originated as a synthetic virus in the lab It has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal Like much of U S Right to Know s work the preprint examines available evidence in order to get a glimpse into what virology experiments might have been undertaken before the pandemic Two competing theories about the origin of COVID 19 have taken center stage One theory holds that the virus spilled over from live mammals sold at a seafood market while the other posits that the virus was released from a laboratory famous for collecting and studying coronaviruses To determine whether SARS CoV 2 had characteristics of genetic manipulation the authors looked at the pattern of markers called restriction sites in the SARS CoV 2 genome Restriction sites are locations where DNA is cut during genetic engineering These restriction sites occur naturally in viruses but can also be added at key locations in the lab to enable genetic manipulation The authors found that two restriction sites commonly used for genetic engineering BsaI and BsmBI were evenly spaced along the genome The longest fragment between these restriction sites is unusually short Both clues are typical for synthetic viruses according to the authors Both restriction sites are recognized by type IIS restriction enzymes which are handy for engineering The authors estimate that the chances that a natural virus would have a similar pattern of restriction sites for this enzyme family is less than 0 07 percent Our preprint found strong evidence suggesting SARS CoV 2 was assembled with a known lab protocol adding weight to the theory SARS CoV 2 originated as a lab construct said Alex Washburne one of the study co authors and a computational biologist who has developed models of zoonotic spillover Criticism and concern from some virologists The preprint raised eyebrows among some virologists The main concern voiced by experts is that a classic approach used to assemble coronavirus genomes so called Golden Gate Assembly usually removes restriction sites or scars from the final product I ve even joked in the future we will easily be able to tell real vs synthetic DNA just by seeing if there are BsaI and BsmBI sites present because most of the synthetic methods to make DNA

Ellis a professor of synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London Sylvestre Marillonnet who pioneered Golden Gate Assembly told The Economist that the pattern of restriction sites indeed appeared to be typical of engineering but that he was struck by the fact that the restriction sites remained in the genome Stanley Perlman a University of Iowa coronavirologist with expertise in reverse genetic systems also thought it was unusual that sites used to generate fragments for in vitro assembly would be left in the assembled genome As a result he found the preprint to be not very credible However the preprint authors said that they analyzed synthetic coronaviruses assembled before the pandemic and eight out of ten retained their restriction sites Golden Gate Assembly is also not the only way to clone viral genomes Other methods keep the restriction sites in the final genome Indeed the authors point out methods that keep the restriction sites were popular at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a partnering lab in the U S at the University of North Carolina We showed that the by far most common method of synthesizing coronaviruses in the lab pre COVID retained the modified restriction sites This method was the most popular method of synthesis at the WIV and UNC said Washburne The main takeaway is that leaving them is beneficial if you are planning on doing a lot of follow up experiments for instance testing a library of receptor binding domain mutations said Tony VanDongen a coauthor of the preprint and an associate professor of pharmacology and cancer biology at Duke University In that case it also becomes economically smarter to not have to assemble the entire genome from scratch every time Perlman also conceded that restriction sites can be left in the genome if scientists want to run multiple experiments But he cautioned against drawing strong conclusions saying there is still no evidence the virus was under study at the Wuhan Institute of

genome has two BsaI binding sites well positioned to allow the efficient swapping of a small part of the genome that we know was of primary interest to researchers the part containing the furin cleavage site and the receptor binding domain he added The receptor binding domain and in particular the furin cleavage are of interest to virologists because they aid the virus entry into human cells The furin cleavage site present in SARS CoV 2 but absent in other SARS like viruses has also spurred concerns about possible engineering Those concerns were amplified by a leaked grant proposal that demonstrated that the Baric Lab and Wuhan Institute of Virology were interested in inserting furin cleavage sites into coronaviruses The DEFUSE proposal proves that some virologists wanted to test numerous receptor binding domain and furin cleavage site micromutations and combinations said Bruttel a co author and molecular immunologist at the University of Würzburg For that one needs 2 unique restriction sites flanking the S1 exactly what we see in SARS CoV 2 Potential bias and chance Some critics of the recent preprint say that choosing to analyze BsaI and BsmBI and not other restriction sites was biased and would lead to skewed results However Washburne said that the authors chose BsaI and BsmBI because their regular pattern stood out right away Restriction sites ideal for engineering are evenly spaced along the genome to provide genomic fragments of similar lengths while naturally occuring sites are usually randomly scattered throughout the genome Bruttel added that most other type IIS enzymes just cannot be combined or produce shorter sticky ends Longer ends can make assembly easier BsaI and BsmBI are also two of the most commonly used restriction enzymes for the assembling viral genomes Two labs that employed BsaI and BsmI to cut coronaviruses include the Wuhan Institute of Virology which used the restriction sites to swap spike proteins and the Baric Lab at the University of North Carolina which used the restriction sites to reconstruct SARS CoV 2 in 2020 Critics of the preprint also say that the seemingly unusual restriction site map observed by the

twice used unpublished China CDC data to advance the idea that COVID 19 comes from a wet market overshadowing findings by the China CDC that the market outbreak was a superspreader event Photo credit Toshihiro Gamo By Emily Kopp and Karolina Corin A team of Western virologists could face professional penalties for scooping data collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in their rush to call attention to their own rapid reanalysis an analysis at odds with the Chinese team s conclusions A prominent group of Western virologists announced last week that data collected by China CDC from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan strongly suggests a zoonotic spillover there in the winter of 2019 likely from raccoon dogs while the China CDC scientists concluded their samples indicate a superspreader event at the market The Western virologists have said in press reports that they sleuthed the data In fact the data was uploaded by the China CDC scientists to a genomic database as their preprint moved through peer review for consideration in the scientific journal Nature The virologists involved in the hasty analysis of the Chinese data were briefly locked out of the major genomic database where it was posted GISAID Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data GISAID has alleged unethical scooping by the Western virologists The virologists access was temporarily restored as GISAID collects more evidence the GISAID Secretariat said in a statement Thursday The review is not complete the statement reads Should the ban be reinstated the scientists would lose access to one of the largest repositories of viral data in the world GISAID locked out the virologists as a last resort because the entire team particularly University of Arizona professor Michael Worobey and University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes ignored requests for clarity from GISAID according to the statement When GISAID received a recent complaint from China CDC researchers about their interaction with registered GISAID users Messrs Holmes and Worobey who communicated their intent to make certain use of data generated by the China CDC that was non compliant GISAID opened an inquiry the GISAID Secretariat said When it becomes evident that any user ignores requests for clarity and appears reluctant to help ensure the data generators rights will be upheld such measures will only be used as a last resort The Chinese scientists had voiced concerns to GISAID that Holmes and Worobey were using their data in violation of GISAID s terms of use according to the statement Many of the same Western virologists including Worobey and Holmes had previously used unpublished China CDC data to advance contrary findings Worobey and Holmes did not respond to requests for comment

coauthors of the recent report responded to inquiries from GISAID until their access to the database was revoked according to GISAID The Western virologists said in press interviews that they tried to collaborate with the Chinese scientists while the Chinese scientists told GISAID they were only contacted about the virologists intent to publish their data The statement from GISAID also underscored that the China CDC virologists were best equipped to assess their own data and warned against premature analyses It should be apparent to everyone that the data generators are the ones most familiar with the details surrounding their submitted data and the context in which it was collected the GISAID Secretariat said Premature discussions of the scientific data in the media risks eroding the public s confidence in scientific research The investigation may depend on whether the raccoon dog report as well as the media blitz it spurred counts as a publication The authors have referred to the analysis as a report rather than a preprint We respect our CCDC colleagues right to be first to publish a manuscript on their own data and do not plan to submit a paper that would compete with their manuscript currently undergoing review their report reads The controversy has reignited a debate about how databases like GISAID should be managed The story of GISAID is not a story about petty fights between petty sad little scientists with personal agendas It is a story about proper governance of the world s largest influenza and CoV dataset said longtime biosafety activist Edward Hammond in a

their 2022 paper as with the raccoon dog report Worobey Holmes and other virologists came to different conclusions than their counterparts in China They argued in a February 2022 preprint that the wet market in Wuhan was the unambiguous epicenter of the pandemic and that the data supplied dispositive and incontrovertible evidence of COVID 19 s origin That conflicted with the findings of the China CDC which said that an intermediate animal host could not be inferred and that the market may have been a superspreader site that amplified the virus The Western virologists 2022 preprint published the day after the Chinese CDC preprint published The media splash that followed the Western virologists claims outshone the more muted conclusions of the Chinese scientists who collected the data The Western virologists manuscript was published in Science in July 2022 though its claims that the findings constituted dispositive and incontrovertible evidence were withdrawn In contrast the Chinese scientists have faced a lengthy peer review process An anonymous peer reviewer said in an August 2022 press report that they would hold up the peer review process of the Chinese team s paper until all of the data describing the genetic evidence in the market was made publicly available Holmes is quoted in the same report saying that this metagenomic data could hold important clues Conflicting

headlined it as the strongest evidence yet for an animal origin of SARS CoV 2 The report by the Western virologists was published on a research repository four days later revealing the extent of their work For a few frenzied days the virologists had analyzed an incomplete portion of the China CDC samples that tested positive for SARS CoV 2 The report s analysis confirms that a variety of mammals including Malaysian porcupine and bamboo rats were sold in the market but the virologists focused on one sample in particular That sample had a high level of raccoon dog genetic material and a low level of human genetic material The sample tested negative for SARS CoV 2 by PCR according to Gao s preprint but further metagenomic sequencing revealed SARS CoV 2 suggesting low traces of the virus This sample was taken in the same area of the market where Holmes photographed a raccoon dog five years earlier By contrast the China CDC team which sampled the market multiple times from January to March 2020 found that zero of 457 animal samples across 18 species tested positive for COVID 19 In an analysis of both positive and negative samples taken from swabs of surfaces around the market like countertops cages and vents they found positive samples were correlated with human genetic material Outside scientists have not had the opportunity to examine the new claims concerning raccoon dogs or

acknowledged that there was illegal wildlife in the market How can you hide something like this he wrote in an email Let s come back to science Other scientists have been critical of the actions of the Western virologists as well When non originator groups proactively moved into pushing an apparently contradictory re analysis of an under review data the originator group logically pull out their data said Gustavo Palacios a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in a tweet A record of exaggeration For years many of the authors of the raccoon dog report have been vocal in their stance that the pandemic originated in the wet market Four of the co authors also authored a controversial 2020 letter that marginalized the lab leak theory as a conspiracy theory without acknowledging the drafting of the letter was encouraged by leaders of the National Institutes of Health which funded high risk virology at the pandemic s epicenter The researchers who reported the data have a documented track record of exaggerating their findings concealing doubts about their findings and hiding major conflicts of interest said Justin Kinney an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co founder of Biosafety Now a non profit that advocates for increased regulation of pathogen research While many virologists have embraced the new findings other scientists have contested them Though the presence of genetic material from wildlife like raccoon dogs suggests that these animals were present in the market many scientists say that no conclusions about COVID 19 can be made There is no evidence that this raccoon dog started the COVID 19 pandemic In fact there is no evidence that this raccoon dog was even infected with SARS CoV 2 as there was

from the environment taking care to sample around the wildlife stalls May 23 2020 China CDC Director George Gao states that the pandemic began earlier than the market outbreak saying that the market was another victim The intermediate host cannot be determined from the investigation of the market he said Scientists researchers and public health workers have worked hard on it but at the current stage we can t tell specifically which animal is the host said Gao I hope the public can give scientists more time for us to understand this virus December 15 2020 A map put together by the China CDC

scientific publishing industry s handling of one of the most controversial scientific questions in decades how the COVID 19 pandemic began Thorp said that two papers published in Science in 2022

unresolved Thorp emphasized that the peer review process at Science had tempered the claims in the papers and generally criticized how the media covers preprints as sensational At the end of the process they were edited under my supervision to ensure that the language was consistent with the extent to which the evidence presented was supportive but not dispositive of a natural origin Thorp

US collaborators in 2018 and especially 2019 the year of the pandemic Furin cleavage site at the S1 S2 boundary While the language of the formal DEFUSE proposal called for the insertion of human specific proteolytic cleavage sites in a portion of the spike protein called the S2 earlier drafts of DEFUSE were more explicit Proteolytic cleavage sites is a more general term than furin cleavage sites It refers to a combination of amino acids that allow enzymes to cleave the spike protein which helps viruses like SARS CoV 2 enter human cells But proteolytic cleavage sites can be activated by a variety of enzymes not just furin This language in the final formal proposal has been a sticking point in the debates over the DEFUSE documents Scripps Institute virologist Kristian Andersen an advocate for the natural origin theory has argued that DEFUSE holds little relevance to the origins of COVID because the grant calls for the introduction of proteolytic cleavage sites at the S2 position of the spike protein However the earlier drafts show the scientists particular interest in furin cleavage sites The documents suggest the scientists were not yet certain about the relative importance of the other cleavage sites Earlier drafts also precisely specify the positions of the intended insertions including ones that correspond to the S1 S2 junction not just at S2 Tissue culture adaptations sometimes introduce a furin cleavage site which can direct entry processes usually by cleaving S at positions 757 and 900 in S2 of other CoV but not SARS the grant reads The position 900 is the S2 site and position 757 is the S1 S2 site A comment on the proposal clarifies that this language cites Baric s Figure C Figure C shows a furin cleavage site at the S1 S2 boundary precisely

genomes for the next step the generation of synthetic viruses in six pieces The spike proteins identified by the group this way to have pre epidemic potential would be employed in the next step the generation of full genome length viable viruses The documents show that the scientists behind DEFUSE proposed a strategy to stitch SARS related viral genomes together using six pieces They planned to assemble full length synthetic viruses These viruses were to be assembled from consensus sequences sequences that summarize the most common base pairs among a group of closely related viruses These

cells the receptor binding domain Baric planned to screen for receptor binding domains with epidemic potential by looking for cleavage sites and receptor binding domains adept at attaching to human ACE2 receptors In addition to the furin cleavage site the almost immediate ability of SARS CoV 2 to spread among humans without having to evolve much the fact it was well adapted has been a red flag

Virology The available evidence appears to be inconsistent with both historic precedent and the scientific understanding of how natural zoonotic spillovers of respiratory viruses like SARS CoV 2 occur the report states The emergence of SARS CoV 2 represents a a significant break from the precedent of other zoonotic spillovers involving respiratory viruses such as MERS and SARS the report continues The closest cousin viruses to SARS CoV 2 were discovered in rural Southeast Asia and Yunnan Province yet SARS CoV 2 appears to have arrived in the metropolis of Wuhan China without leaving an obvious trail in wildlife or in the rural populations along the way The report argues that the absence of evidence along the hundreds of miles that separate southern China and Wuhan stands in stark contrast to the evidence that early SARS cases left behind in 2002 Virologists consider it unlikely that SARS CoV 2 became human adapted in bats because of key differences in our immune systems though the report concedes it is possible Yet nearly three years after SARS CoV 2 first emerged an intermediate host a reservoir of other mammals in which the virus could have evolved the changes it needed to

infections Yet with SARS CoV 2 it has not been shown that infected animals continued to drive infections outside the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan Yet the virus emerged primed to infect and transmit in human populations Former White House COVID Response Coordinator Deborah Birx said earlier this year that COVID 19 came out of the box ready to infect Meanwhile many Western virologists have said that the evidence points unambiguously to the Huanan Seafood Market as the early epicenter of cases Many early cases were tied to the market and even cases without a direct tie to the market appear centered in the surrounding area Michael Worobey a University of Arizona evolutionary biologist and lead author of a well publicized paper tying early COVID 19 cases to the Huanan Seafood Market pushed back on the Senate report a few hours ahead of publication on Twitter Worobey stated that the absence of an obvious intermediate animal or better evidence that SARS CoV 2 circulated in an animal reservoir is an evidentiary gap but not significant citing his paper and a sister paper describing the early evolution of SARS CoV 2 as two separate zoonotic spillovers Our two recent papers establish that a natural zoonotic origin is the only plausible scenario for the origin of the pandemic Worobey wrote The Senator s commission s report cannot change the scientific evidence Worobey has dismissed claims that Chinese authorities focus on the market might have biased the very early data But the report also cites the genetic similarity between samples taken from market stalls and human viral samples They indicate that the market was a human superspreader event not the epicenter of a zoonotic spillover the report states citing a preprint authored by Chinese virologists that has

remains a mystery the committee staff write how SARS CoV 2 acquired its furin cleavage site The furin cleavage site is a feature on the virus s spike protein that makes it especially dangerous Furin cleavage sites do not appear to occur in other SARS like viruses But the report notes that researchers working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology authored a grant report laying out plans to test furin cleavage sites in SARS like viruses though it remains unclear whether this research was performed The Wuhan Institute of Virology s interest in evaluating the pandemic potential of bat coronaviruses this way combined with evidence that the WIV struggled to safely run its new maximum biocontainment lab in the years before the outbreak also persuaded the committee Republicans that a lab origin is more likely Advocates of a zoonotic origin theory must provide clear and convincing evidence that a natural zoonotic spillover is the source of the pandemic as was demonstrated for the 2002 2004 SARS outbreak the report states In other words there needs to be verifiable evidence that a natural zoonotic spillover actually occurred not simply that such a spillover could have

senior World Health Organization expert expressed skepticism in 2020 that the COVID 19 pandemic originated in a wet market according to a U S State Department cable obtained by U S Right to Know The

over from wildlife at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan China This so called wet market sold farmed and exotic imported animals and animal products some of which are known carriers of coronaviruses The Huanan market has become a focal point in the controversy over the origins of SARS CoV 2 Many proponents of the hypothesis that SARS CoV 2 arose naturally say early cases emanated from its wildlife stalls Hypotheses involving other natural sources or the city s nearby coronavirus labs have largely been dismissed or ignored But the cable reports that Mike Ryan executive director of the WHO s Health Emergencies Programme and a top aide to Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was not convinced by the wet market hypothesis Ryan indicated that there could be other original sources of the virus outside of the market according to a summary of his statements relayed in the cable from the U S Mission in Geneva Many of the first cases of COVID 19 were not associated with the market itself the summary of Ryan s statements reads There was likely human to human transmission prior to the identification of the cluster at the market Ryan also said that along with severe hospitalized cases in December 2019 there must have been additional milder or asymptomatic cases implying that the virus was silently circulating earlier and that these cases went unrecorded WHO

SARS CoV 2 is one of the most influential scientific articles in history In February 2020 about a month before a pandemic had been declared five top virologists huddled to examine aspects of a rapidly emerging coronavirus that seemed primed to infect human cells In particular a unique feature called the furin cleavage site caused concern and even kept one virologist up all night A few days later the virologists concluded the virus had not been engineered In March their conclusions were published in Nature Medicine We do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible the article read The article assured much of the media Washington and the broader infectious disease community that there was no need to scrutinize the labs at the pandemic s epicenter in Wuhan China The Wuhan Institute of Virology is well known for research on SARS like coronaviruses including gain of function research Though a correspondence and not a formal paper the article has been cited in the press 2 127 times It ranked as the most impactful medical science article of 2020 the year in which millions around the globe first became familiar with COVID 19 It took 15 months and Freedom of Information Act lawsuits to reveal that each of the five authors had expressed private concerns about engineering or the Wuhan Institute of Virology s store of novel coronaviruses and work in relatively low biosafety levels Also troubling A confidential teleconference had framed early drafts of the article But several scientists on the call had undisclosed conflicts of interest Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar organized the teleconference at the request of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci NIAID had funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology a fact Fauci had been alerted to by late January Minutes after being alerted by one of the virologists to gain of function research underway in Wuhan Fauci dispatched an aide to determine whether his institute had funded this work Fauci was conferring with the National Security Council and the White House almost daily at that time his schedule shows Also present on the call for advice

2020 Discussions begin Farrar called Holmes concerned about chatter about the possibility of a lab accident and a recently published preprint on the server BioRxiv Farrar s memoir does not name the preprint But Holmes identified the preprint in a 2022 interview as Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin coauthored by Wuhan Institute of Virology Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Director Zhengli Shi and published on January 23 The preprint described the sequence of SARS CoV 2 and compared the virus to similar bat coronaviruses discovered by the Wuhan lab including a coronavirus called RaTG13 with 96 percent similarity to SARS CoV 2 I got an email from Jeremy Farrar saying There is some chatter in the U S about whether this virus has come out of a lab do you have time for a talk now Holmes said I think this is started because Zhengli Shi posts her first paper that ends up in Nature that has her sequence and RaTG13 RaTG13 being the closest relative to SARS CoV 2 so of course that leads to lots of chatter Holmes continued Patrick Vallance chief scientific advisor to the United Kingdom may have also been on the line Holmes said Holmes was indifferent to the similarity between SARS CoV 2 and RaTG13 according to Farrar s memoir finding the pattern of variation to be normal I didn t think much of it if I m honest I was busy traveling and trying to write a scientific paper Holmes recounted to Farrar Holmes is a coauthor on partial sequences of RaTG13 alongside Shi These partial sequences were submitted to NIH s database in 2018 but published in July 2022 January 29 2020 Andersen flags gain of function research Andersen became alarmed that a bat coronavirus may have been engineered to

site aid the entry of coronaviruses into mammal cells The 2015 paper had been given an abbreviated title in the emails SARS Gain of function Andersen texted Holmes Kristian said Eddie can we talk I need to be pulled off the ledge here Holmes later recounted Andersen and Holmes met virtually on Zoom Andersen directed Holmes attention to a concerning part of the genome He said there s this furin cleavage site between the S1 and S2 junctions Holmes recounted There are two restriction sites BamHI around it And that section between the restriction sites looks like it has reduced variation Bloody hell this is bad Holmes responded The furin cleavage site on the SARS CoV 2 spike protein aids the virus entry to human cells Research has indicated that without this feature SARS CoV 2 would not have posed a pandemic threat No other known SARS like betacoronaviruses have furin cleavage sites Though not known at the time the Wuhan Institute of Virology was interested in working with Baric on proteolytic cleavage sites in SARS like coronaviruses a leaked grant proposal shows Other worrying information that Andersen shared with Holmes on that first Zoom call according to Holmes retelling Two restriction sites called BamH that approximately flanked the furin cleavage site along the virus genome These restriction sites are commonly used for genetic engineering but also occur in nature

currently circulating 2019 nCoV 2019 nCoV is an abbreviation for the 2019 novel coronavirus Fauci suggests a roundtable of experts to corroborate Andersen s rapid analysis I told him that as soon as possible he and Eddie Holmes should get a group of evolutionary biologists together to examine carefully the data to determine if his concerns are validated Fauci wrote It would be important to quickly get confirmation of the cause of his concern by experts in the field of coronaviruses and evolutionary biology Fauci also suggests that law enforcement should be alerted He should do this very quickly and if everyone agrees with this concern they should report it to the appropriate authorities Fauci wrote I would imagine in the USA this would be the FBI and in the UK it would be MI5 At the

coronaviruses He is bothered by the furin site and has a hard time explain that as an event outside the lab though there are possible ways in nature but highly unlikely Instead of directed engineering changes in the RBD and acquisition of the furin site would be highly compatible with the idea of continued passage of virus in tissue culture Acquisition of the furin site would likely destabilize the

acid level well all but the perfect insertion of 12 nucleotides that adds the furin site S2 is over its whole length essentially identical I really can t think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus or one very similar to it to nCoV where you insert exactly 4 amino acids 12 nucleotide that all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function that and you don t change any other amino acid in S2 I just can t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature Do the alignment of the spikes at the amino acid level its stunning Of course in the lab it would be easy to generate the perfect 12 base insert that you wanted Another scenario is that the progenitor of nCoV was a bat virus with the perfect furin cleavage site generated over 3 evolutionary times In this scenario RaTG13 the WIV virus was generated by a perfect deletion of 12 nucleotides while essentially not changing any other S2 amino acid Even more implausible IMO That is the big if You were

However he also calls the question of the virus origin a distraction for the moment and possibly harmful to science and to China Dear Jeremy and others Thanks for a useful teleconference Given the evidence presented and the discussions around it I would conclude that a follow up discussion on the possible origin of 2019 nCoV would be of much interest However I doubt if it needs to be done on very short term given the importance of other activities of the scientific community WHO and other stakeholders at present It is my opinion that a non natural origin of 2019 nCoV is highly unlikely at present Any conspiracy theory can be approached with factual information An accusation that nCoV 2019 might have been engineered and released into the environment by humans accidental or intentional would need to be supported by strong data beyond a reasonable doubt It is good that this possibility was discussed in detail with a team of experts However further debate about such accusations would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular 8 30 a m Fouchier shared detailed notes His ideas

hypothesis is problematic because the clustering of early cases around the market implies that there was very little cryptic circulation in people The connection to the market would be spurious some

relate to this virus being engineered with intent and that is demonstrably not the case Engineering can mean many things and could be done for either basic research or nefarious reasons but the data conclusively show that neither was done if in the nefarious scenario somebody would have used a SARS MERS backbone and optimal ACE2 binding as previously described and for the basic research scenario would have used one of the many already available reverse genetic systems he wrote As for communicating these ideas to the public just a few days after emailing Fauci that he had found the genome to be inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory Andersen encouraged the scientists to communicate the virus had arisen naturally using a similar phrase only inverted consistent with natural evolution If one of the main purposes of this document is to counter those fringe theories I think it s very important that we do so strongly and in plain language consistent with natural evolution is

scientists submitted four separate studies to various scientific journals about a pangolin coronavirus Some scientists immediately expressed concerns about the lack of the full set of raw data But Andersen and Holmes seized on the announcement The virologists expressed optimism to a reporter at the journal Nature that SARS CoV 2 may have evolved the changes it needed to infect humans through a pangolin intermediary I can definitely believe it could be true said Andersen Although we need to see more details it does make sense as there are now some other data emerging that pangolins carry viruses that are closely related to 2019 nCoV said Holmes The virologists confidence came despite the fact pangolins were not listed on the public inventory of the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market according to the Nature report The virologists quotes were distributed to the wider infectious diseases community via an alert to the ProMED reporting system And while Farrar and Collins expressed hope that the pangolin data would explain the mysterious furin cleavage site the pangolin coronavirus sequences did not have one Indeed Daszak s research showed that the pangolin was an unlikely intermediary Daszak surveyed Guangzhou wet markets from 2015 to 2016 for wild animals and found zero pangolins a grant report shows I mentioned that the pangolin link is likely spurious i e that it s unlikely they were an amplifier of infection at the Wuhan market because they are so rare in the wildlife trade as live animals mainly dried scales sold for medicine Daszak wrote in a February 28 2020

the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy The document was called Summary Feb7 pdf Eddie Holmes and a small group have been looking extensively at the origins and evolution of n CoV including all theories Farrar wrote in an email to Dzau referring to an early abbreviation for the novel coronavirus This is the latest summary written as part of a series of teleconference discussions we set up and included National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins as well as a small group from USA UK Europe and Australia Farrar wrote Holmes would later describe SummaryFeb7 pdf as a summary of the forthcoming proximal origin manuscript saying it was largely unchanged from the version that would appear in a scientific journal ruling out a lab origin in March according to an email to a journalist released in late 2022 In other words in under a week s time Andersen and Holmes had gone from agonizing about breaking the news to the world that SARS CoV 2 was engineered to preparing to tell the world that was impossible 8 36 p m Later that day Farrar hosted a second teleconference 6 52

Farrar also asked whether the authors should publish the piece at all 8 10 p m Holmes responds by emphasizing that many in China believe a lab origin of COVID 19 is possible Ever since this outbreak started there have been suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab if only because of the coincidence of where the outbreak occurred and the location of the lab Holmes said A lot of people there believe this and believe they are being lied to These concerns were heightened when the Wuhan Institute of Virology published a preprint indicating they had sampled RaTG13 a virus 96 percent similar to SARS CoV 2 Holmes said I believe the aim question here is whether we as scientists should try to write something balanced on the science behind this There are arguments for and against doing this Holmes continued Personally with the pangolin virus possessing 6 6 key sites in the receptor binding domain I am in favour of the natural evolution theory 9 21 p m Farrar articulated his goal for the article To frame the debate about a possible lab origin of COVID 19 before it generated potentially hugely damaging ramifications in light of gathering suspicion among reporters and social media accounts that the burgeoning pandemic was connected to the coronavirus lab at its epicenter The aim of this was to bring a neutral respected scientific group together to look at the data and in a neutral considered way provide an opinion and we hoped to focus the discussion on the science not on any conspiracy or other theory and to lay down a respected statement to frame whatever debate goes on before that debate gets out of hand with potentially hugely damaging ramifications 10 15 p m Andersen clarified to the group that his intention was to push back on lab origin theories but that there was not enough evidence yet Our main work over the past couple of weeks has been to disprove any type of lab theory but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn t conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered he wrote He said he hoped coronaviruses rumored to be found in pangolins with a high similarity to

origin and opposed publishing anything Without more credible evidence against engineering in hand nothing should be published he said As to publishing this document in a journal I am currently not in favor of doing so he said I believe that publishing something that is open ended could backfire at this stage Andersen advised the group to wait on more data including the pangolin coronavirus

signatory EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak organized the letter but purposefully omitted EcoHealth s partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the name of University of North Carolina virologist Ralph Baric a coronavirus engineering expert who works with EcoHealth and the lab in order to feign impartiality The letter publicly called upon the WHO to play a role in curbing the lab leak theory The Lancet cited the National Academies letter even though that letter had not asserted that the virus had a natural origin despite Andersen s pressure It s not precisely clear when Farrar opted to sign The Lancet letter but emails show that a first draft was sent to potential signatories on February 6 February 21 2020 Newly available pangolin sequences do not refute a lab origin Farrar s pressure on the journal was working Within days the paper was in peer review In making the case to peer reviewers that the paper was necessary Andersen said that pangolin coronavirus sequences did not adequately address the pandemic s origins These private emails stand in contrast to Andersen s public statements that the pangolin sequences were central to his abrupt about face from suspecting the virus was engineered to viewing that suspicion as crank Unfortunately the newly available pangolin sequences do not elucidate the origin of SARS CoV 2 or refute a lab origin Andersen wrote There is no evidence on present data that the pangolin CoVs are directly related to the COVID 19 pandemic Just as the group encountered resistance from some virologists who opposed treating the possibility of a lab origin with credence at all on the Feb 1 teleconference one peer reviewer made comments that questioned the necessity of the overly speculative paper Andersen underscored the necessity of weighing an accidental lab leak of a natural virus to establish credibility Andersen dismissed the possibility of the virus being engineered outright The culturing of SARS like CoVs from animals is typically performed under BSL 2 and has been ongoing for years Dismissing this potential accidental scenario out of hand or considering it in the same category as conspiracy

articles One article described a letter from Michael Lauer NIH deputy director for extramural research seeking lab books and an inspection of the Wuhan Institute of Virology through EcoHealth Alliance as a condition of reinstating a grant This whole episode is just a woeful attack on the traditional way NIH has maintained its integrity Varmus said in the article A second article postulated a lab

23 p m By Karolina Corin and Emily Kopp American ties to coronavirus research at the pandemic s epicenter in Wuhan are closer than previously understood The U S government underwrote the discovery of the closest relative of SARS CoV 2 known before the pandemic s start The Wuhan Institute of Virology s U S partners claimed the discovery of the close cousin virus in a letter to a member of Congress about U S Agency for International Development achievements and listed a research paper detailing its discovery in grant progress reports to the National Institutes of Health The cousin virus is 96 percent similar to SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 and has been at the center of speculation about the pandemic s origin The close relative RaTG13 was found in a mineshaft where six miners became sick with severe pneumonia Three of the six miners died Yet this extraordinary finding was not widely shared with the scientific community It was uncovered after the emergence of COVID 19 by the independent research group DRASTIC Experts agree that RaTG13 could not have been the direct progenitor of COVID 19 The differences between the two viruses are spread across the genome and evolution from one to the other could require decades Other viruses circulating in Southeast Asia have since been shown to have slightly more similar genomes though phylogenetic analyses still place RaTG13 as the closest relative However its existence has fueled speculation about whether a closer relative could be among the unpublished viruses under study at the WIV Recent reporting citing anonymous sources alleges that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology working with RaTG13 and a related clade of viruses may have been among the first infected with COVID 19 Their research

teleconference hours later with top virologists concerned about signs SARS CoV 2 was engineered which included discussion of similarities between the emerging novel virus and RaTG13 Neither the Wuhan

the 2016 study was published from work funded by this NIAID R01 grant A University of California Davis letter to Sen Dianne Feinstein D Calif goes further suggesting that USAID may have been involved with its discovery In China alone we sampled 10 000 bats and 2 000 other mammals using PREDICT protocols to discover 52 novel SARS related CoV s coronaviruses including the closest relative of the

predicting zoonotic diseases and also coincided with a boom in U S biodefense efforts after 9 11 While the letter to Feinstein suggests that PREDICT helped find or sequence RaTG13 the program s role in RaTG13 s discovery is not certain Only NIH funding is mentioned in grants and publications connected to RaTG13 but EcoHealth often used funds from both NIH and USAID to search for new SARS like

suspended EcoHealth s grant and reinstatement appeared tenuous Daszak denied involvement in the 2016 study pointing out that the sample containing RaBtCoV 4991 was collected before the grant started

to Know is a nonprofit investigative public health group Four years ago we began our research into high risk virological research and the origins of COVID 19 As a part of this work we have filed 169 federal state and international public records requests including 99 Freedom of Information Act requests We have written more than 70 news articles based on the information we have gathered 1 Some of our public records requests have revealed records that shed light on what our government agencies know about the origins of COVID 19 However we also saw that some agencies showed a pattern of obstruction delay and stonewalling It is long past time for the Biden administration to instruct federal agencies to comply with FOIA requests for records related to high risk virological research or the origins of COVID 19 Failure to do so is disrespectful not only to rule of law but also to the grieving families of more than one million Americans who died from the pandemic In the course of our investigation we have had to file 28 public records lawsuits covering 47 separate FOIA and state FOI requests 2 We have had to litigate FOIA requests to 14 federal agencies and sub agencies including Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA Defense Intelligence Agency DIA Defense Threat Reduction Agency DTRA Department of Defense DOD Department of Education ED Department of Energy DOE Department of Health and Human Services HHS Department of State DOS Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Food and Drug Administration FDA National Institutes of Health NIH National Library of Medicine

November 8 2021 we filed FOIA litigation against NIH for nine separate FOIA requests including for communications between the NIH and EcoHealth Alliance or the Wuhan Institute of Virology 6 NIH failed to produce a single record for more than 16 months after we initiated litigation 7 NIH explained that thousands of pages of responsive records were being held in NIH s Office of the Director for what it called a review and consultation with any government stakeholders prior to release 8 NIH has yet to produce thousands of pages responsive to these nine FOIA requests When NIH claims that it possesses no responsive records these claims sometimes do not appear to be accurate For example in August 2022 U S Right to Know filed a FOIA request with the National Library of Medicine part of NIH for all SARS related coronavirus sequences that were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive SRA between 2016 and 2021 but were not released or that were suppressed withdrawn deleted or otherwise

19 It is intolerable that more than four years after the pandemic began there are still so many unanswered questions about its origins and so much missing evidence evidence that we citizens ought to have and ought to have had years ago But intransigence by the Chinese government and U S federal and state agencies have kept this evidence out of our grasp It is the responsibility of our elected officials and especially our President and members of Congress to ensure that our public records laws work and that we can get the answers we deserve about how COVID 19 came into being We need this

s intelligence analysts in early 2020 according to a new email obtained by U S Right to Know Since January 2020 Andersen has been at the forefront of efforts to stigmatize the idea of a lab origin of SARS CoV 2 as a conspiracy theory The briefing s conclusions drew from an influential letter in Nature Medicine called The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 Andersen was the lead author The letter had an enormous impact in both the scientific community and popular press It spurred hundreds of headlines declaring the idea of an artificial virus emerging from the lab complex Wuhan implausible even a conspiracy theory The revelation that Andersen advised the intelligence community at a critical moment on the origins of COVID 19 comes on the heels of an Office of the Director of National Intelligence summary of certain intelligence related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology a coronavirus lab at the pandemic s epicenter Andersen sparked public outrage in 2021 when emails obtained by news organizations showed he had privately expressed alarm that a segment of the SARS CoV 2 genome may have been engineered The emails also uncovered an emergency confidential call between Andersen and other virologists who publicly dismissed the lab leak hypothesis and leaders of the National Institutes of Health which had underwritten cutting edge coronavirus research in Wuhan A few days later Andersen encouraged combatting the crackpot idea that the virus was engineered to the National Academies and the White House The White House subsequently wrapped up a cursory effort to outline data necessary to investigate the virus origin The revelations have driven concerns that the letter amounted to a push to suppress discussion of a scientific hypothesis with explosive implications that the emerging pandemic may have begun with a lab accident The controversy has simmered for years culminating in a hearing before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee tomorrow at which Andersen is expected to appear Andersen will tell the committee that his change in position was not based on a single piece of evidence but a combination of many factors including additional data analyses

Department over the plausibility of a lab origin of SARS CoV 2 and that Andersen s briefing discouraged some officials from investigating As I understand it Dr Andersen did not see a natural origin for SARS COV 2 as obvious In fact I m told that in a briefing organized by INR earlier this year he said that several features that had initially raised questions in his mind were subsequently put to rest by more detailed analysis said Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford said in a December 2020 email Andersen and Ford did not respond to a requests for comment Congressional Republicans had previously voiced concerns at the intelligence community s refusal to share which scientific experts it tapped to advise its investigation into the origins of the most fatal pandemic in a century Feith previously testified that he was precluded by Chatham House rules from sharing who participated in the briefing The fallout In April 2020 a few weeks after the briefing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement declaring it agreed with the scientific consensus that SARS CoV 2 had not been engineered It echoed the conclusion of the influential proximal origin letter The proximal origin letter argued that SARS CoV 2 could not have been made in a laboratory for two main reasons computer modeling does not

director of the biodefense graduate program at George Mason University said that an EcoHealth Alliance grant that funded research that made coronaviruses more deadly by swapping their spike proteins is emblematic of lapses in oversight at NIH The research was not regulated as gain of function work but NIH did add language to the grant requiring extra reporting if the viral engineering led to viruses that were 10 times more pathogenic The chimeric viruses proved to be much more pathogenic than even that threshold but EcoHealth Alliance did not report it That language amounts to a tacit admission that NIH reasonably anticipated the work was gain of function Koblentz said Stefano Bertuzzi CEO of the American Society for Microbiology conceded that labs should report more often to Congress and that scientists could do a better job allaying public concerns but stated that the framework is otherwise sufficient Bertuzzi signaled he is concerned that Congress could step in Labs

University School of Medicine virologist and Kristian Andersen Scripps Research virologist gave sworn testimony to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in July Getty Images Published early in the pandemic an article in Nature Medicine titled The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 known to many simply as Proximal Origin helped push the lab leak theory of the origins of COVID 19 to the outer fringes by March 2020 We do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible the analysis stated which had been read about three million times within weeks of publication Our analyses clearly show that SARS CoV 2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus For years the infectious diseases community had debated whether cutting edge virology gain of function research that generates more dangerous viruses could cause a pandemic Once a pandemic arrived that debate abruptly ended The virologists had sold the public on an irrefutably natural origin But emails and Slack chat messages acquired through the Freedom of Information Act and subpoenaed by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis show that the virologists who wrote the analysis privately expressed concerns that the virus could have emerged from a lab They also reveal the depth of involvement of some of the most powerful men in science including former pandemic response leader and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci in shaping the article Fauci s institute had funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology through an American research organization called EcoHealth Alliance The controversy over Proximal Origin represents years of unanswered questions about how a scientific hypothesis that some scientists and intelligence agencies now consider likely was cast as a conspiracy theory culminating in a committee hearing this summer Four of the five virologists behind Proximal Origin Scripps Institute virologist Kristian Andersen University of Sydney virologist Eddie Holmes University of Edinburgh virologist Andrew Rambaut and Tulane School of Medicine virologist Robert Garry have subsequently coauthored other high impact articles in favor of the theory that the pandemic emerged from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan A fifth coauthor of Proximal Origin Columbia University virologist Ian Lipkin has since distanced himself from the group In the world s most prestigious journals and newspapers these four virologists have cast the evidence for a natural origin as so compelling so dispositive as to render evidence pointing to the Wuhan Institute of Virology immaterial or the makings of a conspiracy theory The virologists Slack messages emails early drafts and interview transcripts span 1 096

with later conclusions and presume any change is due to some unspecified pressure rather than a change in the weight or direction of evidence the Australian Academy of Science said in an August statement Yet a new timeline by U S Right to Know shows that some of the contradictory private and public statements were written on the very same day The timeline shows that even as the virologists incorporated core concepts into their paper that were in favor of a natural origin they simultaneously bemoaned to their coauthors that they were incomplete even crap A few examples First the day after the virologists shared an analysis with their funders arguing that engineering SARS CoV 2 would require significant amounts of molecular work Garry said privately that a graduate student could do it Proximal Origin argues that any genetic engineer would follow computer modeling from the lab of Ralph Baric a University of North Carolina virologist and frequent collaborator of the Wuhan Institute of Virology who had mapped out the mutations optimal for binding to human receptors called ACE2 Proximal Origin argues that although the virus binds to human receptors optimally it does not have these predicted mutations thus is natural The same day this argument was first incorporated into their analysis Garry said that lab escape would not be crackpot given the gain of function research we know is happening Other Slack messages demonstrate an awareness of other approaches to researching viruses utilized by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its collaborators Second the virologists wrote in Proximal Origin that scientists would have never experimented with a novel virus that had not been published in the scientific literature Privately the virologists acknowledged that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had loads of novel viruses in their freezers and that they could conduct engineering experiments on novel viruses on a whim This concept at the core of their paper

They cribbed the idea from one of the world s most controversial gain of function virologists who was concerned about new biosafety regulations They described him internally as unbelievably conflicted He was not credited Third the virologists publicly have attributed their rapid shift from favoring a lab origin to favoring a zoonotic origin largely to the news that a coronavirus up to 99 percent similar to SARS CoV 2 had been discovered in pangolins scaly anteaters used in traditional Chinese medicine But the newly released messages show that within minutes of receiving the sequence of this virus the Proximal Origin virologists noticed it was approximately 90 percent similar to SARS CoV 2 far too dissimilar to serve as a precursor virus The more pango sequences I see the less likely I find that they are intermediate I think they re just one of many animals with SARS like CoVs Andersen said Rambaut told the New York Times that a virus identified at the Wuhan Institute of Virology called RaTG13 that is 96 similar to the novel coronavirus was not a close relative Two days later Rambaut grumbled to his coauthors that coronaviruses allegedly found in pangolins were not close enough to SARS CoV 2 to dispel concerns about the Wuhan lab s cousin virus Up to 99 similar is no good There is a 342 base pair stretch of RaTG13 that is identical to SARS CoV 2 Sigh Rambaut wrote Two days after the pangolin coronavirus sequence was made available Andersen and Rambaut said privately that they remained undecided between a natural or lab origin Fourth the virologists made jokes about the possibility that the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its American partner EcoHealth Alliance ignited the pandemic even as they drafted an analysis that helped shield these institutions from greater scrutiny An early draft of Proximal Origin dismissed as conspiracy theories concerns about an American collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology to conduct gain of function research on coronaviruses The same day this idea was incorporated into the draft Rambaut joked that perhaps EcoHealth Alliance had planned a press conference predicting which virus would cause the next

Andersen shared privately that the suspicions of Sen Tom Cotton R Ark about the Wuhan Institute of Virology were on target Tom Cotton is trending with COVID 19 on the Twitters at the moment I gotta say the guy isn t totally wrong he said In addition the newly revealed messages raise questions about the integrity not only of Proximal Origin but other high impact papers the virologists would go on to coauthor in favor of the zoonotic hypothesis The virologists would privately justify asserting a natural origin with limited genomic evidence because of the epidemiological evidence that the virus had emerged from live animal stalls at a wet market But the new private messages show that they were not confident in that evidence either expressing skepticism about the quality of data out of Wuhan

Jeremy Farrar in the U K and National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins and Fauci in the U S they began accumulating evidence against thetheory that the virus could have originated in a lab The purpose of the call was described by one of the virologists as challenging a certain theory and if we could drop it The virologists messages show that their article was written under the

virologists concerned about restrictions on future research and watered down in response to editors at the prestigious scientific journal Nature Medicine who sought a conclusive statement against any lab origin Soon after the call Farrar Fauci and Collins the virologists began aligning their analysis to the conclusion predetermined by many within the scientific community I personally think we should get away from all the strange coincidence stuff I agree it smells really fishy but without a smoking gun it will not do us any good The truth is never going to come out if escape is the truth Rambaut said the day after the teleconference Given the shit show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release my feeling is we should say that given there is no evidence of a specifically engineered virus we cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape so we are content with ascribing it to natural processes I totally agree that that s a very reasonable conclusion Although I hate when politics is injected into science but it s impossible not to especially given the circumstances Andersen replied Three days after the teleconference Andersen advised the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine that it should come out more forcefully against the crackpot and fringe theory that SARS CoV 2 had been engineered as a bioweapon or for basic research and that the virus is consistent with natural evolution precisely reversing what he said privately a couple of days earlier We all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory I m pretty sure by now they think I m a complete crackpot It s lab emergence not some fringe theory The scientists behind Proximal Origin expressed a sense of

the furin cleavage site a feature on the spike protein that supercharged the novel coronavirus into the most widespread pandemic pathogen in a century They grasped for a natural explanation for the immediate transmissibility of SARS CoV 2 as compared to other coronaviruses like SARS or MERS But it wasn t easy Their private messages describe pangolin coronavirus data as sketchy and too dissimilar to SARS CoV 2 to be meaningful acknowledged that a natural origin would require a convoluted series of events noted the weird suppression of key data by Beijing authorities and grappled with an iffy and majorly confusing viral family tree After weeks of digging for evidence the virologists concluded that the unusual features of the novel coronavirus could occur in nature A draft of their paper stated that a lab origin was not necessary but the published version went further asserting that a lab origin was not plausible Many messages suggest the purpose of the article was to steer the media the public and policymakers away from speculation about lab related scenarios While the group expressed some concerns about rumors on the fringes about deliberately released bioweapons and a withdrawn paper about SARS CoV 2 containing bits of HIV the recently revealed messages also show the virologists helped to quash credible concerns emanating from the scientific community and U S government Marc Lipsitch a Harvard University epidemiologist had circulated concerning comments raised about the lab in Wuhan by Richard Ebright a molecular biologist at Rutgers University both longtime critics of the riskiest gain of function research The Proximal Origin virologists were fielding questions from reporters at Science and the New York Times The influence of Proximal Origin The article was endorsed by Fauci in front of reporters and cameras at the White House cited by the Defense Intelligence Agency and briefed to analysts at the State Department According to recent reporting Fauci cited the Andersen paper to persuade the Central Intelligence Agency to alter its assessment of the origin of the pandemic from lab to nature Since its publication the virologists behind Proximal

included Andersen Garry and EcoHealth Alliance Yet despite all of their professional success the virologists have yet to quiet all of the questions about their integrity Pressed by members of Congress at a hearing this summer Andersen flanked by a team of attorneys backed off prior claims that anyone who disagreed with Proximal Origin was a conspiracy theorist But in the months since Andersen has deflected criticism about Proximal Origin by returning to a familiar refrain Accusing domain experts of fraud is a commonly used tactic by conspiracy theorists he said in a tweet A faulty premise On January 21 2020 Chinese scientists highlighted a feature of SARS CoV 2 called a furin cleavage site situated in an ideal place in the spike protein of the novel coronavirus a feature never seen before in a coronavirus of its kind Furin cleavage sites had been shown to make flu viruses more dangerous and would have been easy to add without a trace The Proximal Origin virologists predicted it would endow the new virus with significantly stronger transmissibility than SARS The discovery put them on edge Days later the Wuhan Institute of Virology released a preprint announcing the lab had identified a close cousin to the novel coronavirus in its freezers a 96 percent match These two revelations were largely responsible for igniting the chain of events that led to Proximal Origin On a February 1 conference call Andersen and Holmes presented their concerns about the furin cleavage site and the Wuhan Institute of Virology Present on the call were Farrar Fauci Collins all of the Proximal Origin authors except for Lipkin and three virologists looped in by Farrar Erasmus Medical Centre virologists Ron Fouchier and Marion Koopmans and Charité virologist Christian Drosten Fouchier and Drosten who have both conducted gain of function experiments and were considered conflicted pushed back forcefully on the hypothesis that SARS CoV 2 was engineered They argued that labs would never pick a completely novel coronavirus as a backbone for gain of function experiments Their colleagues delivered their rebuke in the presence of the virologists funders Farrar Fauci and

Institute of Virology records would later show something he had been made aware of a few days earlier But notes written by Andersen on the same day as the call show that Fouchier s and Drosten s opinions didn t dampen the authors concerns about engineering The only thing that remains perplexing is the fact that it has a furin site with O linked glycans in the spike protein between S1 and S2 the notes read Soon after the call four of the five authors of Proximal Origin everyone but Lipkin began exchanging notes on Slack Andersen named the chat Project Wuhan Engineering Nice channel title Rambaut said Super secret too Andersen replied I think the main thing still in my mind is that the lab escape version of this is so friggin likely to have happened because they were already doing this type of work and the molecular data is fully consistent with that scenario In the more private forum Andersen commented on the pushback from Fouchier and Drosten A cursory review of work in Wuhan showed the lab s interest in discovering novel bat coronaviruses that had not yet emerged in human populations and testing which genetic mutations could transform them into dangerous viruses Both Ron and Christian are much too conflicted to think about this issue straight to them the hypothesis of accidental lab escape is so unlikely and not something they want to consider The main issue is that accidental escape is in fact highly likely it s not some fringe theory Andersen wrote the next day on February 2 I absolutely agree that we can t prove one way or the other but we never will be able to That doesn t mean that by default the data is currently much more suggestive of a natural origin he continued It s not the furin cleavage site is very hard to explain My fear is that the likes of Drosten and Fouchier put the question that s being asked here into the same category as conspiracy theories I m pretty sure by now they think I m a complete crackpot Andersen said Andersen said that

understandable but except for the most simple scenario where somebody plugged a gene into a preexisting backbone engineering would simply be impossible to prove Andersen said The presence of furin a priori moves me slightly more towards accidental release but it s well above my paygrade to call the shots on a final conclusion Garry also appeared to challenge the notion that a lab would never work with a novel virus in an email to his coauthors on February 2 Biological engineers would in fact be likely to study a bat virus that had not yet spilled over into humans he said If you were doing gain of function research you would NOT use SARS or MERS These viruses are already human pathogens he said What you would do is choose a bat virus that had not yet emerged in humans Garry continues by describing simple hypothetical experiments involving engineering and serial passage of coronaviruses that could have resulted in SARS CoV 2 This sort of experimentation would eventually be dismissed as implausibly complicated in the published version of Proximal Origin I aligned the novel coronavirus with the 96 bat CoV sequenced at the Wuhan Institute of Virology Except for the RBD the S proteins are essentially identical at the amino acid level well all but the perfect insertion of 12 nucleotides that adds the furin site S2 is over its whole length essentially identical Do the alignment of the spikes at the amino acid level its stunning Of course in the lab it would be easy to generate the perfect 12 base insert that you wanted he said A likely explanation could be something as simple as passage SARS live CoVs in tissue culture on human cell lines under BSL 2 for an extended period of time accidentally creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans via gain of furin site from tissue culture and adaption to human ACE2 receptor via repeated passage Garry said I really can t think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from

argument which I found to be the strongest about that not being feasible is not true they were already creating those The virologists further questioned Fouchier s impartiality Ron is not going to

to have a 50 percent fatality rate generating a new airborne virus The New York Times described it as the doomsday virus Fouchier s experiment spurred a debate in the scientific community about whether scientific experiments with the potential to cause pandemics should be permitted Despite their private skepticism and concerns about Fouchier s conflicts of interest his ideas were immediately incorporated into the earliest drafts of Proximal Origin The virus backbone beyond spike is not an indicator of a human source of 2019 nCoV emergence Fouchier wrote in a Feb 2 email to the group The virus itself has not been described or characterized previously and no reverse genetics system has been described for this virus It became the paper s keystone argument against the hypothesis that SARS CoV 2 was engineered If genetic manipulation had been performed one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used the article echoed However

after voicing his concerns Andersen adopted Fouchier s argument in a conversation with a group of scientists tapped by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine to examine COVID 19 s origins for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy a group that Andersen said he believed was organized by Fauci The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were also involved I do wonder if we need to be more firm on the question of engineering The main crackpot theories going around at the moment relate to this virus being somehow engineered with intent and that is demonstrably not the case Andersen said Engineering can mean many things and could be done for either basic research or nefarious reasons but the data conclusively show that neither was done in the nefarious scenario somebody would have used a SARS MERS backbone and optimal ACE2 binding as previously described and for the basic research scenario would have used one of the many already available reverse genetic systems he said If one of the main purposes of this document is to counter those fringe theories I think it s very important that we do so strongly and in plain language consistent with natural evolution is a favorite of mine when talking to scientists but not when talking to the public especially conspiracy theorists By this date the draft dismissed the virus being engineered or otherwise created with intent as largely incompatible with the data The day after his email to the National Academies stating the virus is consistent with natural evolution and two days after drafts of Proximal Origin began dismissing the idea of a virus created with intent Andersen told his coauthors he leaned toward the virus having been developed in cell culture in the lab Definite lean for me too Garry replied Serial passage After discounting engineering Andersen and Garry said he leaned toward a lab origin through a technique known as serial passage This technique can generate more dangerous viruses in the lab through serial infections in cells or lab animals Andersen and Garry appeared to think it could be the most likely

also considered spillover through an intermediate host and undetected circulation in humans The changes did not go far enough for Fouchier In response to the new draft he once again pushed back on any lab origin by arguing no close relative to SARS CoV 2 had been described in published scientific literature I am not in favor of publishing as is I fail to see how the last of the three discussed scenarios passaging does not fall under the category of laboratory manipulation There is no evidence that might hint to this scenario and hence it should be put aside just like the engineering option he said As far as I am aware no laboratory has worked on passaging the pangolin origin virus the bat CoV RaTG13 or another closely related virus or had access to it prior to the outbreak That nCoV 2019 could originate from a SARS like virus in Chinese labs can also be excluded The authors did not buy that argument either Crap comments basically just saying it can t be true Holmes said Not only has this been done it s specifically being done in Wuhan In BSL 2 Andersen wrote That in itself means that we can t just dismiss a lab theory off hand by saying not possible That would be very foolhardy The furin link keeps bugging me too Andersen continued I can t find any good references on it in the published literature for coronaviruses Conflating the absence of evidence with actual evidence against Rambaut said Fouchier also said that he opposed a draft of the article that considered the lab leak theory because it could lead to harm to science through renewed debates about biosafety This manuscript would be much stronger if it focused on the likelihood of the first two scenarios as compared to intentional or accidental release Fouchier said That would also limit the chance of new biosafety discussions that would unnecessarily obstruct future attempts of virus culturing for research and diagnostic purposes for any emerging zoonotic virus Koopmans the director of

OK that horse left the barn but I think there may be some hallway talk going on at Erasmus Garry said Unbelievable how conflicted Ron is Andersen grumbled on Slack Much too conflicted to think about this issue straight he said in a separate message The Proximal Origin virologists did not immediately discount serial passage in response to this feedback but did seek other evidence they could use to rule it out They expressed optimism that a coronavirus found in pangolins would provide the missing pieces Andersen reassured Fouchier and Koopmans that he did not support publishing the open ended version of the article they had written without additional evidence for a natural origin He shared their concern that it could backfire As to publishing this document in a journal I am currently not in favor of doing so he said I believe that publishing something that is open ended could backfire at this stage I think it s important that we try to gather additional evidence including waiting on the pangolin virus sequences and further scrutinizing the furin cleavage site and O linked glycans before publishing That way we can hopefully come out with some strong conclusive statements that are based on the best data we have access to I don t think we are there yet Let s hope more pangolin sequences come out Would be critical evidence against cell culture hypothesis which I m still leaning towards Andersen said on Slack a few days later The virologists speculated that prematurely dismissing serial passage in the lab could invite backlash I think we need a stronger argument than an assertion that no lab has done those experiments Rambaut said The pangolin virus that was announced in the press conference might solve this issue if it has the furin cleavage site insertion which would be all but conclusive for the natural scenario Rambaut expressed hope that the pangolin coronaviruses would provide the proof they needed However when the sequences of the pangolin coronaviruses were published the virologists hopes were dashed the pangolin coronaviruses lacked a furin cleavage site The Proximal Origin virologists reached back to Fouchier s argument the one they had dismissed

laboratory based scenario is plausible No smoking gun An overarching premise of Proximal Origin is that the genome of SARS CoV 2 alone can disprove the theory the virus is man made but many of the virologists involved in Proximal Origin made private statements acknowledging lab viruses can be indistinguishable from natural ones Garry noted the furin cleavage site appeared inserted like a scalpel and that it would be relatively easy to insert Even though there s some strange research going on here there s no smoking gun Not quite sure what such a gun would look like though Andersen said on February 2 I m not quite sure what a virus from culture vs an intermediate host would look like I think they d probably be indistinguishable You can synthesize bits of the genes de novo with perfect precision and then add them in without a trace Garry wrote in a February 6 2020 message Even after Proximal Origin was published Andersen expressed doubts to his coauthors that they could truly rule out engineering since a lab technique called Gibson assembly does not leave signs of genomic manipulation No obvious signs of engineering anywhere but that furin site could still have been inserted via Gibson Assembly and clearly creating the reverse genetic system isn t hard he said But he found little support among his coauthors whose position against the lab leak theory had solidified The half furin cleavage site The virologists hoped for more evidence of a natural origin so that they could produce the conclusive statement sought by Farrar Fauci and Collins Fouchier Koopmans and the journal Nature On February 24 Holmes relayed some promising news His lab had discovered RmYN02 a bat coronavirus in Yunnan Province that was 93 percent similar to SARS CoV 2 Holmes shared unpublished data from his lab showing that RmYN02 had an apparent insertion in the same place in the genome where the SARS CoV 2 furin cleavage site was located The furin cleavage site in SARS CoV 2 is made up of twelve nucleotides that encode four amino acids PRRA The bat coronavirus has two amino acids in common with the SARS CoV 2 furin site PAA The new data suggested that it was

furin site PAA The new data suggested that it was theoretically possible for a furin site to develop naturally The virologists called it a half furin cleavage site They hypothesized that recombination the exchange of genetic material between at least two separate viral genomes could explain the furin cleavage site in SARS CoV 2 I m now very strongly in favour of a natural origin Holmes said The component bits of the virus are more or less there in a tiny sample of wildlife I was always in favour of the pre adapted jump from animals hypothesis but now it is plausible that that was directly from bats Rambaut said Both Garry and Andersen remained more cautious No polybasic site HOWEVER this provides a mechanism Andersen wrote I don t see how it gets us any closer to discriminating between any of the models There still needed to be recombination and evolution in either an animal animals humans or all of the above It does not rule out or in lab passage Garry said adding that it is no smoking gun I think this lends pretty strong support for an animal origin of the confusing features of the virus so I think it s important to include None of this disproves accidental lab infection said Andersen However it shows that all the steps can occur in nature Makes it much more likely the full furin site could have been acquired very early in humans or potentially in an intermediate host Andersen said It was necessary to examine the lab hypothesis but we did and it s not necessary to invoke lab escape and the events leading to nCov 19 all could have and in all likelihood did occur in nature said Garry But after examining the nucleotides that made up the amino acids enthusiasm faded You need 2 transitions and three deletions or insertions to go between the furin cleavage sites Rambaut said l am not convinced these are related inserts I still think that all it tells you is there are some bat viruses with an insertion at this site Yes but I think that is an enormous given that 99 of the lab escape idea from genomics was the furin cleavage site insertion and we ve not seen this in any other bat virus I also think it may be a different insertion but it means these

natural explanation much diminished Andersen said Proximal Origin would go further than Garry and Andersen s statements that a lab origin was not necessary asserting a lab origin was not plausible While some virologists agree a recombination event involving a virus like RmYN02 could explain the furin cleavage site in SARS CoV 2 other scientists have raised doubts When first asked about his 180 degree turn on the possibility of a lab origin Andersen said in an email to the New York Times that features in SARS CoV 2 that initially suggested possible engineering were identified in related coronaviruses The virologists private messages show that with regard to the furin cleavage site that s only half true The paradox Holes in the natural origin story Even after the virologists set aside the mysterious furin cleavage site holes in the natural origin story remained The virus emerged with an infectiousness not seen in any coronavirus in natural history The receptor binding domain the segment on the spike protein that binds to host cells appeared to be highly fit Let s not forget that what we ve observed is completely unprecedented as far as I know Never before has a zoonotic virus jumped into humans and spread through the population like wildfire with this kind of speed Andersen said on February 10 This in itself would require further inquiry The virologists flagged the immediate facility with which the virus infected human cells as among the unusual features of the virus that were already noticed or easy to discover Researchers would by February 18 estimate that SARS CoV 2 bound to human cell receptors called ACE2 between 10 and 20 times better than SARS The virologists at once acknowledged that the novel virus appeared optimized to bind to ACE2 yet argued that importantly the interaction is not predicted to be optimal by previous computer modeling The virologists argued that any genetic engineer would use a model of optimal receptor binding discovered in 2008 by a frequent collaborator with the Wuhan Institute of Virology University of North Carolina coronavirus engineering expert Ralph Baric They described this observation as strong evidence the

interested in working with coronaviruses would exclusively rely on such modeling for his experiments While these analyses suggest that 2019 nCoV may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity importantly the interaction is not predicted to be optimal a February 3 draft reads Additionally several of the key residues in the RBD of 2019 nCoV are different from those previously described to be optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding This latter point is strong evidence against 2019 nCoV being specifically engineered as presumably in such a scenario the most optimal residues would have been introduced which is not what we observe The same day Garry sent a Slack that appears to contradict the idea that a genetic engineer would only follow the path determined by this computer modeling It s not crackpot to suggest lab escape could have happened given the GoF research we know is happening Garry said on February 3 The argument in Proximal Origin also clashes with statements the virologists made suggesting that the literature published by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Baric lab appeared to be almost a how to manual for constructing SARS CoV 2 in the lab The argument in Proximal Origin only considers one narrowly defined lab based scenario Yet the virologists privately discussed other approaches that could have led to the generation of a virus like SARS CoV 2 in a lab through reverse genetics or a combination of engineering and serial passage approaches that the authors privately acknowledged the Wuhan lab to have the capacity and expertise to undertake Other messages make clear that even after incorporating this argument into their analysis the virologists remained puzzled by how the virus had emerged preadapted for human spread

It s the epidemiology I find most worrying Holmes said in a message on February 10 This whole thing is doing my brain in I literally swivel day by day thinking it is a lab escape or natural Rambaut said on February 20 several days after supposed new evidence led the group to do a 180 degree turn on their initial concerns about a possible lab origin My brain is a badly calibrated Markov chain Monte Carlo Andersen agreed The evidence that SARS CoV 2 emerged instantaneously pandemic ready also posed a paradox In drafts of the paper dated February 14 and February 15 the virologists note a paradox but note they are not sure whether to include it We still have the paradox Rambaut said on February 24 as they prepared their manuscript for publication If the virus is human adapted it should have started circulating as soon as it arose But we don t see any genetic variants that are likely older than Autumn 2019 Yes paradox still in full force Garry replied This inconvenient complexity was ultimately omitted from the analysis While a half furin cleavage site had been identified the bat coronavirus with the half furin cleavage site had a very different receptor binding domain than the virus closest relative RaTG13 as well as the pangolin coronaviruses How these viruses or related viruses could have recombined into SARS CoV 2 remained perplexing Some convoluted shit going on here Rambaut said On February 26 as the manuscript was finalized the virologists decided to avoid proposing anything too specific I think we should stick to the original plan for this article as much as possible and not try to be too detailed about what we think happened e g which bits in which hosts Holmes said I say this because I am certain that the picture is going to change rapidly as new data

the Wuhan Institute of Virology had collected over the years At this stage we unfortunately just can t rule out a potential accidental infection from the lab Andersen said No we can t and should not because that would have precipitated the cries COVER UP No doubt Tulane would have been implicated Garry replied But ultimately the virologists decided they shouldn t even mention it The only thing that is left in the conspiracy side of things is that a researcher became infected through handling sampling or culturing bat viruses i e the exact one that became nCoV Rambaut said on February 25 But we don t and cannot address the actual nature of the zoonotic event from an evolutionary genomic event so we shouldn t even mention it The spurious connection to the wet market The virologists acknowledged amongst themselves that the data pointing to a wet market may be shaky or the output of a censorious regime These statements contrast starkly with the public stances they would become famous for in scientific papers and the press in the following years The coauthors of the Proximal Origin analysis would go on to lead the world s most headline grabbing scientific analyses in favor of the wet market theory of the pandemic s origins The virologists speculated whether the wet market outbreak was a red herring due to detection bias which would artificially make it seem like Covid came from the market simply because authorities mainly looked for cases connected to the market at the beginning of the pandemic instead of looking at other areas in the city Someone should tell Nature that the fish market probably did not start the outbreak Garry said as the virologists weighed the possibility of undetected circulation in humans prior to that outbreak On January 24 2020 a paper in The Lance t found 13 of the 41 first official cases had no connection to the market The Proximal Origin authors said in their earliest notes that the wet market connection may be spurious and that there was some doubt on that already While furin cleavage sites had been studied in highly pathogenic avian flu it generally required very crowded and poorly ventilated conditions to arise The

virus with the optimal furin like site also had to evolve a near perfect RDB that was as Andersen put it lock and loaded to bind to human ACE2 Garry said on February 3 The major hangup I have is the polybasic cleavage site Clearly it can arise in highly pathogenic avian flu but it s not really a natural process No way the selection could occur in the market Too low a density of mammals really just small groups of 3 4 in cases Holmes said That is what I thought as well which begs the question where would you get intense enough transmission like the poultry farms for H5N1 to generate and pass on the furin site insertion Garry replied That s the million dollar question Rambaut said The virologists expressed concern about the clampdown on genomic data and other epidemiological evidence from the wet market Yet the same virologists would set aside these concerns in subsequent years to assert the certainty of a wet market origin In a 2022 paper in Science whose coauthors included Holmes Andersen Garry and Rambaut the virologists concluded that the official case numbers pinpointed the wet market as the pandemic s epicenter and rejected concerns that biased data collection by the China Centers for Disease Control skewed this picture Like Proximal Origin the Science paper gave the impression that its conclusions were airtight and that the origins debate had concluded Like Proximal Origin it received global media coverage But privately Holmes said that official case numbers from China may not be accurate On March 29 2020 about two weeks after Proximal Origin was published Holmes said that according to his sources in the country COVID 19 cases in China outstripped officially reported cases several times over and that some hospitals in Wuhan had been discouraged from reporting cases There is so much repression and deceit it is ridiculous Holmes said The true number of cases is probably a log more than reporting I was consistently hearing 5

had a contact there who had shared the unpublished environmental samples by February 9 2020 The virus detected around the wet market was identical to the virus detected in patients suggesting that humans and not an intermediate host had spread the virus around the wet market I have seen the environmental sequences I hope this is OK to mention it Eddie they are identical to the Wuhan backbone But who knows what they are Rambaut said If by identical you mean 100 like a lot of the SARS CoV 2 sequences my first guess would be it probably means they did not come directly from any animal Garry replied The environmental sequences are spectacularly uninformative Holmes said Pretty shocking if this is the best they have Yup The environmental samples were entirely uninformative I m not actually convinced they re environmental Andersen said Kinda bummed that the environmental samples didn t show anything at all Andersen said in another message A 2023 analysis cowritten by Holmes Andersen Garry and Rambaut that examined the DNA of possible intermediate hosts in these very swabs highlighting raccoon dog DNA in particular Once again their analysis received global press attention The media likened raccoon dog DNA in these samples to fingerprints found at the scene of a crime However a more in depth analysis of these samples has undermined this claim showing no correlation between viral RNA and the DNA of a plausible intermediate host One sample containing raccoon dog DNA highlighted by the virologists in particular was found to only contain a single read of the virus The Proximal Origin virologists private messages align more closely to the China CDC s own interpretation of the samples it swabbed around the wet market The Chinese scientists have argued the virus detected in the swabs was nearly identical to that found in humans and emphasized that they took samples in the areas of the market where animals were sold As a result any clustering of positive

Proximal Origin authors Andersen and Lipkin privately expressed that Proximal Origin had not truly ruled out all laboratory based scenarios after their letter was published in Nature Medicine By April 3 17 days after Proximal Origin first appeared in Nature Medicine Andersen began second guessing in light of other scholarship A 2013 paper posted to the virology blog Virological showed that serial passage experiments on coronaviruses tended to amplify a 12 nucleotide insert in the spike protein like the furin cleavage site These inserts were arginine rich just like the furin cleavage site in SARS CoV 2 Andersen said The whole furin site being messed with in tissue culture has me second guessing myself Andersen said on Slack When we went through this whole process remember we talked about passage might make viruses acquire these sites We couldn t find a reference but somebody just posted on Virological which led me to this paper Garry described the pattern as freaky I don t think any of this new knowledge goes against what we said in the paper but it does make our definitely not passage argument weaker Andersen said Soon after the Washington Post reported on State Department cables detailing a shortage of trained professionals at the Wuhan Institute of Virology The news spooked Andersen On April 17 just as Fauci cited Proximal Origin as evidence the virus was consistent with natural evolution from the White House press briefing room Andersen fretted privately to his coauthors on Slack I m a little worried about these cables Andersen said Because is it possible that they might have something I m putting all this to typical Trump BS smoke and mirrors and just plain idiocy but I m not quite willing to die on this hill More digging into the scientific literature

exist in SARS CoV 2 because of the proline P in the furin cleavage site PRRA Because these carbohydrate chains can help shield viruses from a host s immune system the virologists reasoned that SARS CoV 2 must have evolved naturally in the presence of an immune system The generation of the predicted O linked glycans is also unlikely to have occurred due to cell culture passage as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system Proximal Origin reads But by a month after its publication Andersen privately conceded that a 2017 paper showed this was likely wrong and that this error toppled a key argument against the possibility of the virus arising out of certain lab experiments I really really want to go out there guns swinging saying don t be such an idiot believing these dumb theories the president is deflecting from the real problems but I m worried that we can t fully disprove cell culture Andersen said Our argument was mostly based on the presence of the O linked glycans but they could likely play a different role Andersen also reiterated a sticking point that each of the virologists had acknowledged in the weeks prior but which was neglected in Proximal Origin that methods in modern virology allow viruses to be easily engineered without leaving a trace We also can t fully rule out engineering for basic research yes no obvious signs of engineering anywhere but that furin site could still have been inserted via Gibson Assembly and clearly creating the reverse genetic system isn t hard the Germans managed to do exactly that for SARS CoV 2 in less than a month Andersen said in the same message Even the half furin cleavage site in the bat coronavirus RmYN02 did not explain how a furin cleavage site appeared in SARS CoV 2 Andersen said RmYN02 has an arrangement around that site but it s not this type of insertion he wrote I agree with you that it s evidence for this all occurs naturally but it still doesn t put a nail in the coffin of the lab

the next day but again pressed his coauthors on the possibility of other lab experiments While our evidence against engineering is very very strong our evidence against culturing isn t the presence of

after publication At the same time the virologists began to field angry emails from people who believed the pandemic leaked from a lab As the lab leak and zoonotic tribes began to solidify Andersen

record materials and methods in two papers This is unacceptable Lipkin said in a separate October 2022 email Pango madness The virologists have pointed to the discovery of pangolin coronavirus sequences that resembled SARS CoV 2 as critical to their 180 degree turn on the question of a lab origin The features in SARS CoV 2 initially suggested possible engineering were identified in related coronaviruses meaning that features that initially looked unusual to us weren t Andersen told the New York Times in June 2021 For example we looked at data from coronaviruses found in other species such as bats and pangolins which demonstrated that the features that first appeared unique to SARS CoV 2 were in fact found in other related viruses But the new messages demonstrate these pangolin sequences were not in fact persuasive especially as the virologists examined them more closely Holmes accounts differ but either on January 30 two days before the teleconference or February 2 one day after University of Hong Kong virologist Tommy Lam contacted him about pangolin coronaviruses of interest By February 5 the virologists discussed the pangolin genomic data sampled from Guangdong and shared with Holmes by Lam Though the pangolin coronavirus lacked a furin site and was too dissimilar from SARS CoV 2 to be a progenitor the receptor binding domain was a close match containing six key residues that matched those of the novel coronavirus Pango madness Holmes wrote Very similar to the novel coronavirus in the receptor binding domain sharing most of the key residues Closer than RaTG13

own pangolin coronavirus from Guangdong reported to be 99 percent similar to the new coronavirus The virologists waited for the sequence to be released hoping it would resolve their questions about the furin cleavage site and more closely align with the novel coronavirus than its closest known relative the Wuhan Institute of Virology virus RaTG13 In a February 8 email that included all of the virologists Fauci Farrar and Collins Andersen said that he believed everybody on this email hoped the pangolins would alleviate concerns about a lab leak The pangolin virus that was announced in the press conference might solve this issue if it has the furin cleavage site insertion which would be all but conclusive for the natural scenario Rambaut said If the genomes lived up to their hype and had the unique furin cleavage site they would provide strong evidence that COVID 19 emerged from nature Emails sent by Collins and Farrar suggest they were eager to see the sequences Has the actual sequence of the pangolin coronavirus been released That will be VERY interesting Does it have the furin cleavage site Collins asked I do not think so yet but chasing Farrar replied However the virologists soon realized pangolins lacked the characteristics of an intermediate host Drafts of Proximal Origin acknowledged that for the virus to acquire the furin cleavage site this intermediate animal host would have to have a high population density to allow the necessary natural selection to proceed efficiently and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue Pangolin receptors appeared too dissimilar from human ones to facilitate the evolution of a virus so preadapted to spread in humans I was trying to get a sense of how similar pangolin ACE2s were to human and whether replication in that host could lead to a receptor that s quite finely tuned to the human receptor Not very clear that that s the case Andersen said on February 7 In addition closer inspection of the press release from the scientists in Guangdong showed the pangolin coronavirus was up to 99 percent similar to the novel coronavirus The virologists acknowledged that it was unlikely to be a close

Times that the Wuhan Institute of Virology s RatG13 was not a close relative of SARS CoV 2 he appeared to privately grumble that the pangolin sequences were not close enough to dispel concerns about RatG13 Up to 99 is no good There is a 342 bp stretch of RatG13 that is identical to CoV Sigh Rambaut replied The implications of a 99 similarity and a 99 8 similarity are pretty profound and at least would dramatically alter the discussion Garry said On February 18 Rambaut shared the sequence of what he believed was the pango99 virus The virologists soon noticed that the pangolin coronaviruses did not hold the key to the pandemic s origin Pango99 if that is what it is doesn t have the furin site Rambaut said When they say up to 99 they mean an average of 90 Rambaut said on February 18 I think they have got over excited with their results and claimed too much Holmes said Garry said the pangolin receptor binding domain was unlikely to have contributed to a recombinant that led to the novel coronavirus No more of a smoking gun than RaTG13 as far as nCoV goes not close enough to be the progenitor nor locally close enough to make a strong case that it might serve as a substrate for a recombinant that lead to nCoV he said The virologists updated their draft of Proximal Origin with the claim that finding a pangolin coronavirus with a similar receptor binding domain to the human optimized one in SARS CoV 2 proved it was the result of natural selection But privately the virologists were stuck on the lack of a furin cleavage site Far from dispelling their concerns about lab accidents Andersen and Garry speculated about whether the pangolin coronavirus had been studied in a lab in serial passage and acquired the furin cleavage site that way Without an insert the closer it is the more likely the serial passaging theory becomes Rambaut said Question is did they recently realize that pangolins carry CoVs and then grew them in the lab to see if they could infect human cells This is quite a high probability event Andersen said in a separate message Clearly none of these pangolin sequences were the source though The more pango sequences I see the less likely",

find that they are intermediate I think they re just one of many animals with SARS like CoVs he also said The virologists resolved to stay vague on the question of which animal could have served as the intermediate host I don t think we want to come down too heavily on the side of pangolins for now I would just putting a bloody great question mark there Or use a generic rodent sort of thing Holmes said on February 12 Andersen may have remained concerned about the data quality too Four pangolin sequences just dropped as well unfortunately these are similar to the previous and not similar in the receptor binding domain Andersen said on February 17 I m starting to think that one pango that stands out might not actually be correct A few days later after the article s submission to Nature Medicine a peer reviewer opposed its publication because they believed the pangolin sequences were likely to resolve the origin mystery The virologists pushed back saying they were not a close enough match to have a direct relationship to the pandemic The more sequences we see from pangolins and we have been analyzing discussing these very carefully the more unlikely it seems that they re intermediate hosts Andersen said They definitely harbor SARS CoV like viruses no doubt but it s unlikely they have a direct connection to the COVID 19 epidemic Unfortunately none of this helps refute a lab origin and the possibility must be considered as a serious scientific theory which is what we do and not dismissed out of hand as another conspiracy theory We all really really wish that we could do that that s how this got started but unfortunately it s just not possible given the data Andersen continued The pangolin data would not be published for weeks due to censorship in China

inquiries later revealed The data renamed without attribution to the earlier paper came from a handful of pangolins seized by Guangdong Customs in March 2019 The virologists private messages contrast sharply with their public depiction of the pangolin coronaviruses as a major revelation and turning point Concerns about the Wuhan lab and EcoHealth Alliance Though Proximal Origin only makes a passing reference to biosafety the virologists expressed serious concerns about risky research and biosafety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology the new messages show The Proximal Origin paper does state that basic research involving the passage of coronaviruses has been done at biosafety level two across the world Biosafety levels range from one to four BSL 1 to BSL 4 with one being the most lax But the virologists private messages show their concerns about the biosafety levels being hazardously low specifically at the Wuhan Institute of Virology where scientists had a strong interest in conducting gain of function research that could make coronaviruses more dangerous Andersen observed that potentially risky experimentation with coronaviruses in Wuhan was conducted at a completely nuts level of BSL 2 which is much less safe than the BSL 3 required for typical experiments with SARS and MERS and the BSL 4 level required for the most dangerous viruses Biosafety level two would be insufficient for a virus as infectious as SARS CoV 2 Performing these in BSL 3 or less is just completely nuts IMO it has to be performed at BSL 4 with extra precautions Andersen said Andersen also expressed concerns about gain of function research more generally Honestly I m not sure that type of knowledge is at all actionable while of course being exceptionally dangerous It only takes one mistake he said in the same message The virologists also recognized the lab s very strong focus on spike proteins in coronaviruses where the worrying furin cleavage site mutation resides The main concern is the kind of stuff that is being done getting MERS like viruses to infect humans getting SARS like viruses to cause disease in mice and infect humans etc Andersen said There s a very strong

the fact that we are discussing this shows how plausible it is Because SARS like viruses circulate in South China the virologists also asked how a SARS like coronavirus could have arrived hundreds of miles away in the metropolis of Wuhan without sparking other outbreaks along the way Holmes remarked that all SARS like coronaviruses had been found hundreds of miles from Wuhan in southern China Holmes also noted that the Wuhan Institute of Viroogy found most of their coronaviruses in Yunnan Province Interestingly all the SARSr CoVs that are capable of using human ACE2 were found in R sinicus in Yunnan Province Andersen quoted from Shi Zhengli s paper There are bat betaCoVs from Hubei Wuhan s province but they fall into different clades and are not from R affinis The Wuhan group seem to sample almost exclusively in Yunnan Must have loads in their freezers So IN that sense it s no surprise that their virus is from Yunnan BUT if natural what must mean is that there is a betaCoV from a bat from Hubei that is 96 5 similar to 2019 nCoV AND that there must be an intermediate host that is even closer still Again may all be natural But I am struck by how differently this virus is behaving from SARS Holmes said Garry notes that the city of Wuhan was treated as an unlikely site of exposure to bat coronaviruses in an EcoHealth Alliance study Sera from Wuhan I kid you not was used a control group Garry said Andersen made a similar observation about RaTG13 the cousin virus identified at the Wuhan Institute of Virology I believe RaTG13 is from Yunnan which is about as far away from Wuhan as you can be and still be in China What are the chances of finding a viruses that are 96 identical given that distance he said Ebola got from Middle Africa to West Africa in 10 20 years

2019 Holmes said More generally the virologists demonstrated they were aware of the years long debate within the scientific community in the years before COVID 19 emerged over whether new techniques in virology research could spark a pandemic The mind can play tricks and one of those tricks is denial Garry said SARS CoV 1 escaped from Chinese labs 2 3 or 6 times depending on your source AFTER the outbreak that killed 10 of people infected was over Yes Wuhan maybe getting too much of the attention could be anywhere We know two groups in Guangdong were doing metagenomics and growing CoV from pangolins perhaps for years Escape via a custodian or researchers could happen from a lab and you would PROBABLY never know it The virologists privately ridiculed the Wuhan Institute of Virology s chief American partners the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance and Baric s lab at the University of North Carolina joking they had possibly released the novel coronavirus even as they publicly supported these scientists Andersen Garry Rambaut and Holmes had previously been critical of EcoHealth Alliance s plans to expand its approach to pandemic prevention by seeking to collect every virus circulating in nature and predict which could spill over into the human species But after the pandemic emerged from Wuhan the virologists pivoted to defending EcoHealth s research as essential to stopping the next pandemic Yet the virologists continued to make private gibes about EcoHealth its virus collection program with the U S Agency for International Development called PREDICT and Baric s lab They mocked EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak as Dastwat and the Grand Wizard of EgoHealth Garry proposed creating a diagram to outline the origin possibilities in play which at that point

being identified would be beneficial to them otherwise we re all going to point fingers at them telling people that they re so shit that they can t even predict the outbreaks of their own making Too harsh Andersen said on February 7 The virologists also expressed concerns about the work of Baric Drafts of Proximal Origin as early as February 3 state that genetic data clearly shows that 2019 nCoV is not derived from any previously used virus backbone including those recently posited by various conspiracy theories based on a 2015 paper in Nature Medicine with a reference to a coronavirus gain of function collaboration between UNC and the Wuhan lab that privately concerned the virologists Proximal Origin had ruled out a gain of function experiment gone awry but privately the jokes continued In a February 10 message Garry joked about the next novel coronavirus diseases that escapes from anywhere say a lab in North Carolina Mere days after joking about PREDICT Daszak and Baric as potentially culpable for the pandemic the virologists received their first citation A letter published in The Lancet circulated by Daszak condemned any questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology as stoking prejudice and distrust and cited an early version of Proximal Origin published on a virology blog By the time Proximal Origin published in the spring the virologists appeared comfortable with their analysis supporting the continuation of the virus hunting and gain of function research they had privately expressed concerns about even in light of concerns raised by other credible

Rambaut appeared to push the virologists to publish something that would dampen down the lab leak theory As some of the most influential funders of scientific research in the world Fauci Farrar and Collins had their own motives for downplaying the possibility that gain of function research had ignited the emergent pandemic Farrar said that a credible group of scientists should rein in the discussion about Wuhan s labs before that debate gets out of hand Farrar passed along drafts and updates to Fauci and Collins Farrar also sought their input as to whether it should be published at all The virologists nicknamed Fauci and Collins the Bethesda boys after NIH s headquarters of Bethesda Maryland Fauci and Collins simultaneously exchanged emails about whether the NIH could be linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology s research on RaTG13 the novel coronavirus close cousin virus Fauci had been alerted by late January that his institute had funded coronavirus discovery and research in Wuhan through the EcoHealth Alliance Collins also expressed concerns the theory could damage international harmony As the February 1 teleconference got underway with Fauci Farrar Collins the Proximal Origin authors and the gain of function virologists including Fouchier and Koopmans on the line the Proximal Origin authors exchanged thoughts on Slack About 40 minutes into the call the virologists exchanged enigmatic messages Big ask Holmes wrote Destroy the world based on sequence data Yay or nay Andersen replied A few minutes later Andersen makes another reference to an apparent request Makes sense what he s saying but man that s hard to pull off he said The precise nature of the big ask remains unclear But it is clear that after the call the group of virologists began accumulating evidence to suggest the virus was not engineered and shelving the evidence pointing to a lab I think someone needs to lay out the science of this before it gets out of hand and causes more formal

hypothesis than the idea that a scientist would only experiment on a known virus I think we need stronger arguments than an assertion that no lab has done those experiments Rambaut said on February 8 Is it possible to argue that A a passaging experiment wouldn t create the features we see Or B that there are logical reasons why someone wouldn t do such an experiment The virologists have insisted that they approached the problem as agnostic scientists and intermittent Slacks do indicate some desire to weigh the lab origin possibility with fairness I just think we need to lay out the features in the data and leave it open as to the cause Holmes said on February 3 Just outline what needs to be explained and leave it like that Irrespective of what the answer is and will likely never know these are really important bits of biology I think we should stick to our guns about the message and not tone it down just to get it published Holmes said on February 20 But the new messages also show how that impartiality receded amid pressure from their powerful funders their virologist peers and editors from the journal Nature The virologists had not even been grappling with the evidence for a week when Farrar asked if they could provide information to three of the most prestigious journals in the world Messages indicate that Farrar offered to use his position of power overseeing billions in scientific funding at the Wellcome Trust to place the piece in a high profile scientific journal When can you update Lancet Nature New England Journal of Medicine will all review immediately Farrar

theory and to lay down a respected statement to frame whatever debate goes on before that debate gets out of hand with potentially hugely damaging ramifications My preference is that a carefully considered piece of science early in the public domain will help mitigate more polarised debate Farrar continued If not that debate will increasingly happen and science will be reacting to it Not a good position to be in Any ambiguity as to Farrar s aim was dispelled in another email also dated February 6 in which he relayed a request from Koopmans who the Proximal Origin virologists knew opposed addressing the lab leak theory at all to dampen down further the conspiracy idea as soon as possible Possible to dampen down further the conspiracy idea and make totally neutral Talking with Koopmans last night and with the WHO meeting next week both wondering whether actually publishing this sooner but ruthlessly on the science is worthwhile to put that flag down The virologists sought Farrar s permission for every incremental question whether to publish the paper what preprint service to use whether to add another author to the byline even whether to circulate it to a wider email chain Had a chat with Jeremy this morning Rambaut reported on February 12 Really not much more to say Just that he still thinks it is important to get a matter of fact paper out there Yes let s just

of an existing SARS related coronavirus to it is improbable that SARS CoV 2 emerged through laboratory Farrar proposed holding a press conference Discussions about whether to hold a press conference may have included Daszak one email suggests It s going to blow Holmes said on February 6 Hence why Jeremy wants is thinking about putting something out Hence the toned down version I just sent him The group hoped the pangolin coronaviruses would prove a natural origin Our main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn t conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered Andersen said on February 8 Like Eddie and I believe Bob Andrew and everybody on this email as well I am very hopeful that the viruses from pangolins will help provide the missing pieces For now giving the lab theory serious consideration has been highly effective at countering many of the circulating conspiracy theories We now have and we will get more pangolin data We think we can tie this up even tighter with the next iteration and make a conclusive statement which will be the go to scientific statement to refer to Farrar echoed on February 8 just a week after their analysis had begun Yet as the pangolin coronaviruses proved disappointing Garry expressed concerns their data was insufficient I have to admit likewise that I don t really know the answers maybe someone else does Garry said on February 10 The data we have is just insufficient Even the pangolin coronavirus prob not helping unless it magically has a furin cleavage site which seems very doubtful But under pressure to produce a published report in favor of a non lab origin for the powerful funders the group pressed forward with arguments and data they privately lacked confidence in When Andersen pitched the piece to the journal Nature he said that it had been prompted by

primarily genetic data he said Pressure from their peers Nature The virologists received pressure to distance themselves from the conspiracy position from colleagues in the field of virology who conduct gain of function research namely Koopmans Fouchier and Drosten Their colleagues opposed giving oxygen to the lab leak theory at all or even calling the public s attention to the unusual furin cleavage site A dispute occurred between the Proximal Origin virologists and the gain of function virologists over whether ignoring the possibility of a lab leak or credibly considering and dismissing it would be more effective at quashing ideas they considered conspiratorial Specifically acknowledging the possibility the virus emerged from serial passage could lead to headlines saying top scientists consider this could have come from the lab Andersen said But the virologists also knew a rejection of the lab leak theory without the appearance of having seriously considered it could lead to accusations of a coverup This is already out there in full force so it d be very important to discuss Can t just sweep that under the rug Andersen said on February 9 While it ruled out lab origin scenarios the preprint on the virology blog Virological released on February 17 included some the ambiguity the virologists were privately grappling with Conclusively proving any origin theory would be difficult perhaps impossible Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS CoV 2 is a laboratory construct it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue the preprint read However any discussion of a lab origin was scrubbed from the final draft of Proximal Origin after editors with the journal Nature questioned whether the piece would feed or quash the conspiracy theories The virologists apparently considered wielding Farrar s influence to get around the rejection from the journal Nature I get a sense that Nature might be a little gun shy hence we d need to go all the way to the top Andersen said Good idea let Jeremy know and give him the rationale

could do that that s how this got started but unfortunately it s just not possible given the data In response to the journal s pushback the virologists made a tweak that would dramatically alter the meaning of Proximal Origin changing their conclusion from saying that a lab origin was not necessary to stating that a lab origin was not plausible Andersen set to work on a press release titled The COVID 19 coronavirus epidemic has a natural origin scientists say The pressure to reject the lab leak theory within the scientific community was so immense that an anonymous whistleblower submitted a tip to a journalist in July 2020 that sought to expose the Proximal Origin virologists for having briefly entertained the lab leak theory Holmes found himself defending the group for having ever considered the possibility I strongly reject the idea that we should not have raised nor discussed the possibility of lab escape as scientists we have to present all the data and discuss it openly That s all we did To have not mentioned the possibility of lab escape would have been negligent Holmes said Media manipulation The recent messages released by the committee show in new detail how the authors of Proximal Origin collaborated with Farrar Fauci and Collins to curtail discussion of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the media The idea of engineering and bioweapon is definitely not going away and I m still getting pinged by journalists I have noticed some of them starting to ask more broadly about lab escape and for now I have just ignored them there might be a time where we need to tackle that more directly head on but I l let the likes of Jeremy and Tony figure out how to do that Andersen said on February 4 We ll all likely be facing the lab escape or natural question

already noticed or easy to discover The group also expresses some anxiety about the press and specifically the New York Times finding out they are examining the origins of the pandemic at the request of Farrar Fauci and Collins Don McNeil then a veteran science reporter at the New York Times asked well informed questions of Rambaut and Andersen after being tipped off by a source that the U S government was investigating whether the virus had any connection to the Wuhan Institute of Virology Ignoring could further escalate which I have to be very careful about one main problem I have too is that my name is on official things looking at this so I need to be able to deflect potential future enquiries that could directly involve name me Andersen said The virologists immediately began deflecting his questions For example McNeil asked whether genetic manipulation could be detected in a virus I gotta say he pretty much nailed it Let s not tell him Andersen said Genetic manipulation leave signatures in a virus No Garry said to the other virologists You could put the furin site in very cleanly Yes But I didn t say that Rambaut replied I am thinking of just replying and saying that I see nothing in the genome that would make me believe it has been genetically manipulated in the lab Rambaut wrote Andrew s response is credible and correct but is not going to satisfy all the reporters Garry pointed out McNeil very credible but like every reporter can be mislead sic Andersen also told McNeil that there was no way the virus could be a lab construct repeating the false rationale at the center of Proximal Origin that engineering is easily detected A lot of conspiracy theories are talking about this being either a lab strain that had previously been produced or some

the messages clearly show the distortion of the issue in the media the degree to which the authors of Proximal Origin influenced the U S government remains ambiguous It s not precisely clear to what degree the U S government was informed about concerns that SARS CoV 2 was engineered and about Proximal Origin before its publication even after the release of hundreds of pages of communications It is clear that Andersen briefed an interagency meeting organized by the State Department s intelligence analysts soon after the paper published an email obtained by U S Right to Know shows Documents obtained by U S Right to Know shows that the article was incorporated by the Defense Intelligence Agency into its early COVID 19 origins report The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement in April 2020 claiming that the intelligence community agreed with the wide scientific consensus that the virus had not been engineered an apparent reference to Proximal Origin but the genesis of this statement remains unclear But there are conflicting accounts as to whether the U S intelligence community was alerted to the virologists concerns about a lab leak According to Holmes Andersen informed the U S intelligence officials soon after flagging potential signs of engineering to Farrar and Holmes When Fauci first learned about the furin cleavage site he said that if the virologists agreed there was cause for concern that MI5 and the Federal Bureau of Investigation should be notified Fauci who was meeting with the White House and National Security Council regularly by that time said that he would alert unnamed officials But Farrar s memoir makes no mention of U S intelligence services The memoir only states that Fauci alerted Collins and that both were

resistance from a collaborator of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in a very ugly Zoom call The Feb 15 2021 call was revealed for the first time in an email obtained through the Freedom of Information Act Tedros took issue with the extremely unlikely ranking and sought to acknowledge as credible the hypothesis that the COVID 19 pandemic began at one of the city s virology labs in the March 2021 WHO convened study of the origins of SARS CoV 2 But EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak perhaps the Wuhan lab s closest American collaborator strongly opposed Tedros openly arguing with the WHO leader on a call with other members of the mission and senior WHO leadership present according to a 2021 email Daszak sent colleagues By the way at one point after we returned from Wuhan the DG Director General openly tried to get us to change the conclusions of our poll that we held in China re lab leak so it would be more likely than extremely unlikely Utterly shameless Daszak wrote in an August 19 2021 email This led to us in particular myself and REDACTED arguing with the DG in a very ugly 2 hour zoom call Most of the senior staff around DG are ashamed of his political maneuverings Daszak continued REDACTED and others were very quiet on the zoom call when the DG announced to the team that he d be setting up a new structure and we d have to reapply for membership for Phase 2 through our governments this time The call occurred a few days after the February 9 2021 press conference in Wuhan in which the mission announced their conclusions the WHO confirmed As Daszak favored the joint WHO China study published a few weeks later on March 30 2021 reported that introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway A spokesperson for

also illogical to allege that Dr Tedros s position was a political act aimed at the U S due to the upcoming DG reelection There s ample evidence that Dr Tedros did not take political stands around the pandemic neither during the last year of the previous administration amid threats of U S withdrawal nor during the subsequent administration Jasarevic said Daszak served on the mission to Wuhan to

between 30 and 60 Chinese colleagues and a large number of them were not scientists not from the public health sector We know there was huge scrutiny on the scientific group from the other sectors The month long mission to Wuhan was hamstrung by lengthy negotiations with the Chinese government and a two week quarantine The visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology only lasted a few hours and did not involve an independent inspection of lab records The report indicates the visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology involved little more than presentations by the lab s leadership The WIV Director raised the issue of conspiracy theories reiterating that the Institute had worked with the media to stress the need to respect science in the fight against COVID 19 and to rebut the theories the report reads The international team s visit could help to defuse some of the theories that were circulating In response to criticism of the report for prematurely ruling out a lab leak the international team wrote a commentary in Nature pointing out that a laboratory origin hypothesis schema is presented on page 119 of the 120 page report The report then describes the scenario as extremely unlikely We held frank discussions with key scientists in the relevant Wuhan institutions a line of inquiry that exceeded our original mandate the team wrote When we reviewed the responses to our questions on this issue and all other available data we found no evidence for leads to follow up we reported this fact Tedros s influence The international team presented its rankings of various hypotheses at a press conference from Wuhan on Feb 9 2021 The conclusion that the lab origin theory had been ranked as extremely unlikely or was considered at all came as a surprise to the WHO

us no longer believe it the radiologist said Even security guards are infected he said The denial of human to human transmission and crackdown on frontline doctors coincided with the closure of the

years on the Chinese government has yet to provide the World Health Organization with the raw data underlying its 2021 origins investigation WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević recently confirmed to U S Right to Know Yet the wet market theory largely hinges on official statistics the Chinese government provided the WHO Some Western virologists say the earliest hospitalizations cluster around the wet market like a bull s eye proving the pandemic began there beyond a shadow of a doubt But Beijing s years of censoring information from this early period complicates that hypothesis The interview with the Wuhan radiologist originally appeared in Caixin Caixin is the most popular non English digital outlet in the world It has a reputation for strong investigative reporting The radiologist described the unprecedented nature of the pandemic to a reporter A colleague pronounced a classic sentence Wuhan will go down in history as a result he said U S Right to Know uncovered the document through Freedom of Information Act litigation against the U S State Department Documents obtained by U S Right to Know from the State Department also include a screenshot of the Caixin error page Woah I don t even have to translate for you to guess what this means deleted from Caixin a State Department official wrote But the surrounding pages are heavily redacted making it difficult to understand the context An image of the Caixin error page U S Right to Know has not independently verified all of the claims in the Caixin document or independently confirmed the radiologist s identity The interview was excerpted in a Caixin article noticed last year by Gilles Demaneuf a researcher with the independent group DRASTIC who has been studying the situation in the frontline hospitals and shared the article with U S Right to Know In those excerpts the radiologist has been given a pseudonym For his safety the radiologist s name has been redacted by U S Right to Know in the State Department document How early COVID statistics were censored The Caixin report lays out in unprecedented detail how COVID cases were censored Initially only six hospitals could report suspected cases the radiologist claims He does not specify which hospitals but it is clear from other sources that early surveillance and retrospective searches focused on neighborhoods around the wet market The confirmation of suspected COVID patients had to go through a three level review process a claim supported by other reporting The process was complicated and long and there were very few confirmed

they had collected Second the provincial CCDC would pick only a selection of samples from each hospital to test We all knew that each hospital had a corresponding reporting quota the radiologist said Authorities were controlling the increase in confirmed cases by controlling the number of virus samples tested Third hospitals were made aware that not all of their samples should come back positive Though not explicitly stated the provincial CCDC expected the hospitals to help generate a low seropositivity rate the radiologist said Officially there were 59 cases in China on January 5 Reports suddenly stopped without explanation Six days later on January 11 the official case count was revised down to 41 after using the very first PCR test kits Yet in his hospital alone the radiologist observed 2 cases on January 5 4 cases on January 6 7 or 8 cases on January 7 and 30 cases by January 10 roughly doubling every three to four days after that The virus is so contagious that many people have already been infected by the time ordinary people become aware the radiologist said Once word got out that there was a novel SARS like virus circulating from person to person sick people started showing up in greater numbers at hospitals like the radiologist s rather than in cheaper clinics I have never seen a virus spread so quickly the radiologist said On Jan 18 I saw 86 cases of ground glass images and every day after that it exceeded 100 cases On Jan 21 it was 136 cases and on Jan 22 it was 137 cases By Jan 20 denial of human to human transmission became untenable Officials

difficult to estimate the current situation but things didn t look optimistic he said The CT machines overheated The radiologist s colleague expressed a foreboding about the emerging crisis saying Wuhan will go down in history for this All but the most severe cases were turned away to quarantine at home Some patients begged on their knees for the hospital to admit them according to the radiologist A separate deleted Caixin report corroborates that hospitals were overwhelmed and turned most people away Our hospital s outpatient department was crowded with a large number of suspected patients who couldn t be admitted he said Some begged the doctors to admit them while some critically ill patients didn t even have the strength to climb onto the examination table for a chest X ray It was heart wrenching These people our parents and grandparents might have been able to avoid such suffering he said Epidemiologists say the interview shows in evocative detail how cases were suppressed I found this quite moving said Colin Butler an epidemiologist at Australian National University Whoever wrote this was speaking out I wish they could know that they have sympathisers and allies in far away places who will never know them But the experts also say it s not surprising that exponential spread was occurring in early January even as authorities denied a crisis was building A 2020 study by Chinese scientists in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that human to human transmission was happening by mid December Daniel Lucey a Georgetown University infectious diseases expert points out Lucey said that January cases don t tell us much about the pandemic s origin and that more information is needed about suspected cases in November and December 2019 He said the WHO s

in the early days of January said Raina MacIntyre a professor of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales We did a study in early 2020 which estimated vastly higher case numbers in China than were officially reported said MacIntyre Part of that would be asymptomatic or mild cases but clearly that only explains a small amount of the discrepancy as the magnitude of unreported cases in our study shows In order to spread as quickly as the radiologist describes in January the virus may have needed to begin infecting people before the wet market outbreak I think the most interesting thing this fellow says is that there are clearly tens of thousands of cases said David Fisman a University of Toronto epidemiologist That implies a much earlier introduction than would have occurred with a seafood market outbreak due to the time taken for the epidemic to grow Obfuscation and withholding of key information by Chinese authorities about the epidemiology of influenza like illness and clinical data pertaining to COVID like illness has made it extremely difficult to understand when the pandemic began said David Relman a Stanford University microbiologist and biosecurity expert Based on all available information we can reasonably conclude that the pandemic did not start at the Huanan Market in December Pressure on doctors to remain silent The Caixin interview illustrates how authorities pressure on frontline doctors to remain silent and retribution against whistleblowers has made obtaining information about the pandemic s earliest cases more difficult There has been a deliberate effort to obfuscate useful information about the beginnings of the pandemic said Relman I ve even heard Chinese authorities who should have had access to all data say that they were thwarted and have little confidence in the data themselves The threat of retaliation loomed according to the radiologist What really intimidated us was when the Wuhan police announced the lawful handling of eight rumor spreaders This had a significant impact on silencing the medical community the radiologist said In several other stories from the frontline flagged by Demaneuf investigative reporters lay out how the virus spread was suppressed at Wuhan Central Hospital and other top hospitals The early suppression of information is perhaps best emblematized by Li Wenliang an

doctors in Wuhan were discouraged from recording new diagnoses dismissing many with COVID symptoms as having simply a lung infection That s also corroborated by a New York Times interview with a Wuhan Central Hospital doctor who was one of the first doctors to treat a COVID 19 patient They said that a patient simply diagnosed in early January with a lung infection was transferred to the hospital by people in hazmat suits the kind I ve only seen in movies At that time most doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital were precluded from wearing masks in order to maintain the ruse that the virus did not transmit person to person Dozens of workers at Xinhua Hospital had caught the novel coronavirus by the end of January It suggests to me the leaders were either demoralized or callously sacrificing

Wuhan lab complex called out actions that we ourselves are doing and demanded access that we ourselves would never provide the email states The email may offer a window into one reason the origin of a

signed a bill to declassify intelligence related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology within 90 days An email obtained from the State Department through a FOIA request New emails obtained by U S Right

acknowledged the U S government s lack of clarity on the question of the pandemic s origin During the course of my work on COVID 19 since January I have had numerous opportunities to review the intelligence and also to discuss this very question with both Dr Fauci and Dr Redfield head of the CDC Biegun wrote Our leading medical experts were quite definitive in conversations with me as late as June that they simply could not draw any solid conclusions as to the origin of the virus Biegun also indicated that while he supported releasing information about the labs in Wuhan he faced deep concerns from the intelligence community and health agencies as well as opposition from within the State Department After this statement was drafted I took calls this week expressing deep concerns

work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that discovered new coronaviruses and that enhanced their pathogenicity in the lab according to federal records and grant reports NIH did not properly regulate the experiments it funded at the Wuhan Institute of Virology according to two independent watchdogs The high risk virology research there received improper exemptions from rigorous oversight by NIH they say The Wuhan Institute of Virology hosted a coronavirus database that was made inaccessible to the public in September 2019 and ultimately taken offline That database may have been informed by research underwritten by U S taxpayers according to biosecurity experts China maintains at least four maximum security laboratories while the U S houses eight according to biosecurity academics at George Mason University and King s College London In his 2021 email Biegun also voiced concerns that the statement could be undermined by antagonistic officials through anonymous quotes in the press The worst outcome is that we issue a statement that is impeached by anonymous press leaks and expert analysts Biegun wrote I see every indication that this outcome is likely The media s hostility to the possibility of a lab origin of COVID 19 particularly when the theory was voiced by former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also delayed the release of the State

Army has been deeply involved in virus research in the United States for many years In another email he expresses the same concern I m also nonplussed at the tendency to assume biological weapons work at the WIV because PLA officers are involved in virus work at WIV and elsewhere since by that faulty logic we ourselves must have a BW program which of course we don t he wrote The pandemic s

Institute of Virology coronavirus research scientist Shi Zhengli was denied permission to use the BSL4 lab for SARS experiments according to a U S State Department cable obtained by U S Right to Know The cable states that The National Health and Family Planning Commission of China which was responsible for overseeing laws and regulations regarding public health denied Shi permission to use the high containment lab This information was redacted when the cable was originally disclosed by the Washington Post in April 2020 though it was tweeted by Josh Rogin in July 2020 U S Right to Know obtained the fully unredacted cable confirming Rogin s tweets The previously redacted sentences along with more recent reports point to biosafety gaps at the WIV prior to the pandemic According to the Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions WIV researchers needed to adapt their biosafety methods and equipment when they couldn t obtain necessary technologies from abroad The Senate report even suggested that accidents with viruses in the BSL4 lab may have already occurred Release of the cable early in the pandemic stoked the controversy over Covid 19 s origins by highlighting biosafety concerns at the Wuhan lab famous for studying and manipulating coronaviruses Denying permission to elevate containment for high risk research is dangerously close to granting permission to trigger a pandemic Richard Ebright Rutgers University Early reports described the leaked cable as a warning shot about unsafe conditions at the WIV Their newly operational BSL4 lab didn t have enough trained staff to safely operate the facilities and the approval process for viral research was described as opaque The unredacted cable portions show just how opaque this process was and raises questions about research oversight at the WIV Shi is considered an expert coronavirologist She has spent over 18 years studying coronaviruses with a special focus on those related to SARS and MERS Her research includes controversial and potentially risky experiments like generating a chimeric coronavirus capable of infecting human cells using SARS as the backbone SARS is classified as a Risk Group 3 level pathogen by the NIH as well as a select agent and should generally be handled according to BSL3 practices According to the CDC s Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories guide BMBL if an experiment causes risk factors like virulence or pathogenicity to increase more stringent biosafety controls may be required Other documents obtained by U S Right to Know show that Chinese labs generally used BSL3 labs for SARS research No information is given in the cable about the experiments Shi intended to do but her request to use the BSL4 lab suggests that she anticipated an increased biosafety risk A request to elevate containment to BSL 4 could reflect an elevated assessment of risk said Richard Ebright a", "chunk_id":

but her request to use the BSL4 lab suggests that she anticipated an increased biosafety risk A request to elevate containment to BSL 4 could reflect an elevated assessment of risk said Richard Ebright a molecular biologist at Rutgers University According to Ebright this could happen because of an increase in risk associated with the pathogen Or for example an increase in risk associated with the experimental methods Antonius VanDongen a biology professor at Duke University agreed stating that at the time the cable was written BSL4 labs were usually reserved for the deadliest viruses like Ebola or Nipah If the request for BSL4 access was for SARS experiments the researchers must have been aware they increased the pathogenicity by a lot said VanDongen He then explained Because working under BSL4 conditions is extremely cumbersome and slow one does not request access to those facilities unless absolutely required by the type of experiments you need to do and the pathogenicity of the virus you are working on The cable doesn t state whether Shi carried out the planned experiments at a lower biosafety level than requested However lack of access to high containment biolabs for risky research can potentially lead to accidental infections among researchers Denying permission to elevate containment for high risk research is dangerously close to granting permission to trigger a pandemic said Ebright Indeed SARS has already led to multiple lab accidents in China Singapore and Taiwan in both BSL3 and BSL4 labs The unredacted cable states that no reason was given for denying Shi permission to use the BSL4 lab for SARS work According to the cable Shi said that government procedures for approving viral research were not transparent An interesting redaction The cable describes potentially risky research performed at the WIV at lower biosafety levels The scientists found a bat cave harboring many SARS like coronaviruses which they showed had the potential to jump directly from bats to humans The unredacted cable states that it is interesting that WIV scientists are allowed to study the SARS like coronaviruses isolated from bats while they are precluded from studying human disease causing SARS coronavirus in their new BSL 4 lab until permission for such work is granted by the NHFCP National Health and Family Planning Commission It is

BSL2 The ability of some SARS like coronaviruses to use the ACE2 receptor suggests that they may be able to infect people using the same mechanism as SARS Experiments done in partnership with the WIV also showed that some might be able to escape or evade therapeutics developed for SARS Despite this the WIV s biosafety committee allowed bat coronaviruses to be handled according to BSL2 standards unless the experiments were done in animals WIV needed international assistance The final significant redaction suggests that China did not have the expertise necessary to safely operate its new BSL4 lab In order to fully and safely run the lab China is likely to need additional technical assistance and advice from the international community a previously redacted portion reads Yuan Zhiming a professor and investigator at the WIV expressed similar sentiments in an article published just before the pandemic began According to his article regulations for research authorization and pathogen management needed to be strengthened Zhiming also wrote that most laboratories lack specialized biosafety managers This makes it difficult to identify and mitigate potential safety hazards Without

are summarized in part and extended by Sam Husseini journalist and Jonathan Latham virologist in their recent article Key claims The Leendertz investigation detected no Ebola in the bats they sampled in the vicinity of Meliandou The investigation did not detect Ebola in other animals in the area The investigation found no evidence of the decline in mammalian species in the region typical of Zaire Ebola outbreaks There is no clinical evidence that Emile or his immediate contacts had Ebola infections as no blood or other samples were ever taken from any of these suspected cases There is no clear evidence that Emile had contact with the hollow tree or with bats Emile was reported to have been two years old but he was 18 months old at the time Relatives say he was too small to play on his own or to eat bats and that he was always with his mother Emile connects to the first proven Ebola cases only via epidemiological links that the Leendertz team acknowledges are not well established Widely

Persistent rumors in West Africa linked the disease to the Kenema laboratory There is a long colonial history of Western medicine and geopolitical interests using Africa as a site for medical experimentation The VHFC had received tens of millions of dollars from the U S government to study viral hemorrhagic fevers a biodefense interest that received a boon of funding following the anthrax attacks in 2001 Ebola was an established research interest for members of the VHFC leadership A few months before the outbreak the VHFC removed from its website an article about major advances in Ebola research VHFC scientists have made conflicting statements about whether the Kenema lab conducted Ebola research After years of denying that Ebola research was conducted at the lab including a 2022 article by virologist Robert Garry that said we did not have EBOV in our laboratory and therefore could not have released or engineered it virologist Kristian Andersen said in an interview that they had been studying Ebola in Kenema in Sierra Leone Inspections by the WHO CDC and MSF found many biosafety lapses at the Kenema lab both in the Tulane operated lab and in another lab operated by

cephalosporin antibiotic Pfizer gave the children a substantially reduced dose of the ceftriaxone relative to that approved by the U S FDA Pfizer is said to have done this to skew the test in favor of its own drug The Nigerian government called the clinical trial an illegal use of an unregistered drug It alleged that participants and their families were not told that they were part of a trial nor that Médecins Sans Frontiéres MSF was offering the standard treatment in another part of the same building The survivors of the trial later pursued legal action against Pfizer in the U S the government of Nigeria also later sued Pfizer which subsequently led to an out of court US 75 million settlement that was subject to a confidentiality clause Overall the 1996 meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria killed about twelve thousand people These deaths were principally associated with the human subject research deliberately carried out by Pfizer on patients who had come to treatment

removing her from a top level position after she complained about agency delays in advancing a lead poisoning prevention program In testimony before Merit Systems Protection Board Judge Joel Alexander Etzel described being shocked to learn she was being placed on leave without pay in September 2018 and the vindictive cat and mouse games she alleged EPA officials used to block her from scheduled national and international speaking engagements She also testified that the agency issued public statements designed to discredit and intimidate her They appeared to be just trying to smear my good name she testified Etzel is a pediatrician and epidemiologist who was brought into the EPA in 2015 by the Obama administration to direct the agency s Office of Children s Health Protection OCHP Etzel previously worked as a senior officer in the department of public health and environment at the World Health Organization in Switzerland and also previously worked for the U S Centers for Disease Control and on public health matters within the U S Department of Agriculture The agency actions against her occurred during the Trump administration and allegedly followed an aggressive push by Etzel to launch a federal action plan aimed at reducing childhood exposures to lead According to her whistleblower complaint Etzel spoke out about gross mismanagement and a substantial and specific danger to public health from childhood lead poisoning and tried to promote the release of a new federal strategy even after EPA leadership delayed the plan s final review In response EPA placed Dr Etzel on administrative leave without warning fabricated complaints about her leadership and obstructed her ability to travel to attend and speak at professional conferences Etzel alleges Separate from Etzel s allegations four EPA scientists have recently come forward with allegations that the agency is putting corporate interests ahead of public health protection allowing dangerous chemicals into the marketplace The whistleblowers allege the EPA routinely uses intimidation tactics to coerce agency scientists into ignoring data showing risks of harm with certain chemicals and or altering

stronger updated statement about Etzel to state that she was placed on administrative leave because of serious reports made against her by staff that were very concerning After being put on leave Etzel went on multiple television shows to talk about the agency actions In testimony Monday she said she felt she had no other choice I had been completely silenced by being placed on administrative leave and I was not able to do the job that I was hired to do I had no other venue Etzel testified I basically took an oath when I became a doctor to do no harm and by being silent when hazards continue in the environment unabated I do harm and so I m not willing to do that I had to speak out Etzel said the lead plan that was ultimately rolled out after she was placed on leave was weaker

Etzel was former EPA official Reginald Allen who served in several positions at the agency including as Acting Deputy Chief of Staff Allen testified that during the Trump administration Millan Hupp a political appointee close to then EPA administrator Scott Pruitt absolutely engaged along with Pruitt in unethical behavior and was at least partly instrumental in working to push out certain EPA personnel Pruitt who was appointed by Trump to run the EPA was pushed out in July of 2018 amid evidence of multiple ethical violations Allen further testified that Helena Wooden Aguilar who was acting

about Etzel s management including allegations from employees that she failed to follow agency HR policy was emotional and would bully co workers Allen testified that she determined Etzel had poor management abilities and had lost the respect the trust the confidence of those she managed Allen confirmed her findings in a report that stated It is my view that Ms Etzel cannot effectively perform

Protection Agency EPA have alleged dozens of violations of the agency s scientific integrity policy over the last few years including complaints of political interference and tampering with chemical risk assessments but nearly all the complaints have been ignored according to an analysis conducted by a nonprofit group representing EPA employees Seven complaints were filed very recently between January and July of this year according to EPA data obtained by the group Since 2017 there have been a total of 68 allegations of scientific integrity violations inside the EPA including 35 allegations filed between 2019 and mid year 2021 according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility PEER PEER is currently representing four EPA scientists who have come forward as whistleblowers offering internal agency emails and other documents as evidence of what they allege is wide spread corruption driven by powerful political and corporate influences Among other things those whistleblowers have claimed specifically that chemical risk assessments have been altered or otherwise tampered with in order to make chemicals entering the marketplace appear safer than they actually are The result leaves the public exposed to chemicals that may cause cancer developmental problems or other hidden health risks Importantly the whistleblowers have said that agency misconduct has continued through the first several months of the Biden administration The information obtained by PEER shows that of the 35 allegations filed from 2019 through June 2021 12 were closed 22 remained unresolved and only one was deemed substantiated but even that one has not led to any punishment It s a complete sham Jeff Ruch one of PEER s regional directors and former executive director said of the EPA s scientific integrity program They give the illusion that they have a program but it s worse than nothing because it suggests they re holding themselves to a high standard of scientific integrity when they re not Interference The EPA has publicly reported scientific integrity complaint information through 2018 but has not filed public reports for complaint information since The data for 2019 through June of 2021 was procured by PEER through a Freedom of Information Act request The nonprofit requested details about the complaints and their handling but EPA provided only very limited information illustrated in pie charts The information in the pie charts shows that interference in scientific work ranked as the most often cited type of complaint Five of the seven

whistleblower complaints PEER is involved in the EPA scientists notified the agency s office of scientific integrity last November about their concerns about a memorandum that made policy changes they scientists said weakened human health assessments in a way that made them less likely to find risks with a new chemical substance Their concerns were ignored for months according to PEER The memorandum was eventually revoked but the altered chemical assessments were not corrected and the scientists fear the policy memo will be reinstituted according to PEER In the EPA s 2018 report the agency said that Scientific integrity remains an ongoing priority for EPA and said the agency works with special advisors and committees and engages the Office of Inspector General OIG when needed to

director of the litigation group for the nonprofit public interest organization Public Citizen which has litigated Freedom of Information Act cases for U S Right to Know They hear whatever case comes before them all sorts of cases For example she said they don t have a ton of experience with the Motor Vehicle Safety Act The judges lack of scientific expertise went on display in June when the Supreme Court corrected an opinion that contained the wrong scientific terminology In a Supreme Court ruling on emissions control measures of nitrogen oxides Ohio v Environmental Protection Agency the opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch referred to nitrous oxide also known as laughing gas They issued this opinion Snyder said the Supreme Court with its clerks and all of its cite checking that s supposed to be going on and they had laughing gas in there Regulators retain some power The ruling that struck down Chevron deference does not affect all decisions by federal agencies particularly in matters such as expertise on the safety of consumer goods Zieve said that the ruling does not address the Food and Drug Administration s determination of a drug s effectiveness or the Department of Transportation s decision on the safety standard for a particular airbag It doesn t deal with those types of expert decisions Zieve said However she said in less specific areas of expertise such as issuing regulations on how to implement a statute for air quality standards the power in those determinations now goes to the judges It s easier now for them to impose their policy preferences rather than having the agencies do that she said To some extent because of uneven application of Chevron deference in recent years in different courts the new ruling may not amount to a seismic shift in the decisions they make In some courts Zieve said like the federal court in DC the judges will apply Chevron deference regularly But in other courts like in Texas 5th Circuit the judges haven t been using Chevron deference anyway Rather she said the judges are just holding regularly that the agency was wrong Snyder said that as judges signal whether or not they will defer to agency recommendations

Engineered Corn MEX USA 2023 31 01 By Professor Michael Antoniou King s College London UK May 28 2024 Expert testimony before the Panel established pursuant to Chapter 31 Dispute Settlement of the Agreement between the United States of America the United Mexican States and Canada USMCA Summary This report provides an overview of key studies and other evidence on the toxicity of agents contained in genetically modified GM corn and other GM crops including Bt VIP insecticidal toxins and herbicide residues in particular glyphosate There is no intention to claim that all studies that have investigated the safety of GM crops show toxic or other adverse effects Nevertheless this report compiles a large body of evidence from well controlled laboratory animal toxicity studies that show evidence of harm to multiple physiological systems This shows that it is not possible to generalise about the safety of GM crops and that each individual variety needs to be tested Studies are presented that show major compositional differences between GM and non GM crop varieties including corn These studies demonstrate that the GM transformation process can result in unintended compositional changes at both a protein and metabolite level stemming from the DNA damaging effects of this procedure Thus claims that GM foods are substantially equivalent to their non GM counterparts and are therefore safe are not supported by the scientific evidence These changes may have unknown health consequences for the consumer The report summarises findings from well controlled animal feeding studies including some commissioned by industry to support regulatory authorisations that show signs of toxicity from the consumption of GM corn and another GM crop soy These studies repeatedly show that the main organs and systems affected by the consumption of the GM food are the liver kidneys digestive tract and immune system The report progresses to consider the health implications of glyphosate based herbicide residues that will inevitably be present in GM glyphosate tolerant corn and other crops It is beyond the scope of this report to review the vast number of studies undertaken to investigate glyphosate herbicide toxicity Instead the report summarises work by my own research group and others of particular relevance In studies on animals exposed to regulatory relevant doses of glyphosate and commercial glyphosate based herbicide formulations adverse effects were observed in multiple organs and systems including gut microbiome structure and functional 5 dysbiosis oxidative stress in the gut and internal organs non alcoholic fatty liver disease increased markers of genotoxicity DNA damage and carcinogenicity It is particularly noteworthy that these toxic effects were more pronounced in animals exposed to the commercial glyphosate based herbicide formulations than those exposed to glyphosate alone This demonstrates the high degree of toxicity of the co formulants present", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:usrtk.org_expert-report-on-toxicity-of-genetically-engineered-corn.txt:0:3858cdc42c9c", "wtk_id": NaN},

pronounced in animals exposed to the commercial glyphosate based herbicide formulations than those exposed to glyphosate alone This demonstrates the high degree of toxicity of the co formulants present in these formulations the composition of which is generally kept secret by manufacturers and the residues of which are never monitored in foodstuffs by regulatory agencies In vivo toxicity studies of glyphosate and commercial glyphosate based herbicide formulations presented in the report consistently demonstrate that the currently held regulatory no observed adverse effect level NOAEL for glyphosate and by default the acceptable daily intake level ADI is incorrect and set too high Indeed based on the current available evidence the safe dose of glyphosate when consumed over the long term is unknown The report also summarises key epidemiological studies One such study has shown statistically significant associations between glyphosate based herbicide use and non Hodgkin lymphoma In addition scientists have found links between occupational use of glyphosate based herbicides and a marker of DNA damage genotoxicity called mosaic loss of chromosome Y mLOY mLOY has been associated with blood cancers such as lymphoma myeloma and leukemia as well as with Alzheimer s disease Furthermore in a study that analysed the urine of applicators of glyphosate based herbicides it was found that markers of oxidative stress were significantly elevated This included the marker of oxidative stress known as 8 OHdG which is also an indicator of direct DNA damage Furthermore the report summarises studies that have investigated the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with other pesticides used on corn all of which were administered to laboratory animals at the acceptable daily intake ADI dose These mixtures of pesticides including the glyphosate resulted in numerous negative health outcomes This shows that the regulatory practice of setting ADI values based on toxicity studies of individual pesticide active ingredients is invalid and puts public health at risk It is important to bear in mind that all the GM corn toxicity studies summarised in this report have tested single Bt trait or single herbicide tolerance trait varieties However the current reality is that the vast majority of GM corn that will be imported into Mexico from the US will be stacked trait varieties engineered to contain multiple Bt VIP toxins and herbicide tolerances Without scientific foundation regulators have assumed that the toxicity of the stacked trait varieties is no greater than the toxicity of any individual Bt VIP or the residues arising from an individual herbicide tolerance trait In conclusion this report provides evidence that Mexican citizens will be exposed to

Farmers in the US are using more antibiotics on farms particularly in pigs and cattle than they did seven years ago when their use to boost animal growth was prohibited Scientists and veterinarians worry that excessive use of antibiotics on farms is furthering antimicrobial resistance Photo iStock Antimicrobials are widely used to treat or prevent disease in farm animals across the US More of these medically important drugs are sold for use in livestock than for humans each year Using antimicrobials gives illness causing bacteria a chance to develop ways to evade them a problem that killed 1 14 million people globally in a single year topping deaths from HIV and malaria combined What s more mortality is expected to grow by nearly 70 over the next 25 years reaching a similar scale to the COVID 19 pandemic To tackle the crisis nearly 8 years ago the US Food and Drug Administration FDA effectively banned farmers from using medically important antimicrobials to boost growth in livestock a practice regarded by many researchers veterinarians and advocates as excessive and unnecessary Antimicrobials are a group of drugs that kill microorganisms including bacteria viruses and fungi The FDA contends that the widely welcomed ban along with some other reforms have led to significant and sustained changes in the use of antimicrobials on farms But advocates for cutting the use of antimicrobials warn that the FDA s assertions are disingenuous New data shows sales are falling says FDA Using fewer antimicrobials is crucial to help preserve important medicines for the good health

doesn t yet routinely collect data on how much antimicrobial farmers actually use In a summary analyzing the new data the FDA highlights that sales fell by 2 percent from 2022 to 2023 and by 37 percent since 2015 Most of these gains come from a big drop in sales as farmers geared up to meet the ban on using antimicrobials to boost growth In a statement to US Right to Know an FDA official wrote that the agency believes the overall trend in volume of sales indicate a significant and sustained change in how antimicrobials are sold and distributed in food producing animals But veterinarians and advocates for cutting antimicrobial use in farm animals warn that sales are actually growing for some livestock species After an initial drop sales began creeping back up Steven Roach who works on safe and healthy food at the Food Animal Concerns Trust FACT a campaign group says that after an initial welcome drop sales began to rebound after the ban came into force We can all agree that what the FDA did had an impact he says But the impact is limited and the drop in sales wasn t big enough he adds Roach calculated a small drop in sales between 2022 and last year but a 6 9 percent rise from 2017 His calculations take account of changes in the size and weight of livestock populations clarifying that shifts in sales are not due to fluctuations in animal numbers The initial drop in US sales is largely due to big cuts made in chicken and turkey farming with the former sector slashing sales in half since 2017 and dropping a further 4 6 percent between 2022 and last year says Roach Less progress is seen in pigs and cattle Roach calculated a small drop in sales for pigs between 2022 and 2023 but a 24 percent rise since 2017 Sales for cattle rose by 1 5 percent

Working an advocacy group based in the US says the FDA is unnecessarily soft on the major corporations that promoted overuse of antibiotics on farms and has fallen short of its weak promises to tackle the problem Consequently US farmers are lagging behind their European counterparts Farmers in Europe stopped using antimicrobials to boost growth over a decade prior to those in the US They also no longer use antimicrobials routinely to prevent disease Antimicrobials on European farms have dropped by around 43 percent over nine years up to 2020 at which point use on the continent was over 80 percent lower than in the US Wallinga s research shows In contrast routine use of antimicrobials is common on US farms particularly in intensive and confined operations where large numbers of animals are housed in close quarters and animal welfare and sanitation standards are lower says Hansen Wallinga says the FDA s assertions that it has achieved large and sustained cuts in antimicrobial use and

rebounded after the ban which the agency puts at around 9 percent between 2017 and 2018 but says that numbers have remained relatively stable at a reduced level since then It would be unrealistic to expect sales of medically important antimicrobials for food producing animals to decrease every year the official adds Reading patterns of bacterial resistance is hard The FDA says that its efforts to cut antimicrobial use are associated with reductions in resistance among key bacteria principally Escherichia coli E coli and Enterococcus The former is a common bacteria that infects the intestines of people and livestock causing diarrhea urinary tract infections and pneumonia The latter can also infect the urinary tract and the lining of the heart Scientists suggest that as the use of antimicrobials drops resistance should also drop although a direct link between cutting drug use and reducing bacterial resistance is difficult to prove In a letter dated 17 September the agency told U S Senator Cory Booker D NJ that a concomitant decline in resistance among these bacteria are important indicators of change The FDA s comments were in response to a letter from Sen Booker asking the agency for a progress report on its strategy to tackle antimicrobial use in livestock But researchers say that reading trends in resistance to antimicrobials isn t straightforward Independent academic research and data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System NARMS a collaborative program run by the government state and local public health departments and universities shows that resistance to antimicrobials is falling for some bacteria and some drugs but rising for others And resistance in poultry and cattle is faring better than in swine Csaba Varga an infectious disease epidemiologist who researches antimicrobial resistance in animals and people at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign says that resistance to the most crucial antimicrobials such as cephalosporins that treat infections like pneumonia and meningitis generally remains low But there are some worrying shifts he says Antimicrobial resistance to critical medicines is rising In research published last year Varga found rising resistance to cephalosporins in E coli samples taken from pigs He also found E coli with very high resistance to other less critical antibiotics like ampicillin

it s dropping she says Whatever the chicken industry is doing is working she says Mohsen Naghavi a health metrics scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle who works on antimicrobial resistance says that it s difficult to parse an overall picture of the battle against antimicrobial resistance by looking at trends in bacteria Every pathogen and drug combination has a separate story he says Instead he prefers to gauge progress by looking at patterns in human mortality from antimicrobial resistance Globally more people are dying from it today than three decades ago Between 1990 and 2021 deaths from antimicrobial resistance grew by 80 percent in people 70 years and older but fell by around 50 percent in children younger than 5 years leading to a slight increase in overall mortality An FDA spokesperson said in a statement that the agency s responses to Senator Booker s letter adequately summarize its accomplishments and the challenges it faces But to understand the impact the policies have had research is needed to compare the resistance patterns before and after the policy changes says Varga To make real headway in the battle against antimicrobial resistance US farmers must further reduce their need for antimicrobials by improving living conditions and the welfare of animals in intensive farming operations including by reducing animals stress the density in

pig operations has reached their residences Chris Heaney and Devon Hall Sr courtesy of Chris Heaney The project is described in a study that is submitted to the journal Science of the Total

conditioning units roof front porch vents refrigerators and TV remotes They sealed the swabs inside tubes containing a liquid solvent similar to those used as home testing kits for the virus that causes COVID 19 and sent them to the laboratory at Johns Hopkins University for analysis The analysis found that the pig specific DNA sequence was widespread inside and outside the homes of people who work in and live next to industrial pig farms They found only one positive sample from an urban area located far from the farms The researchers also calculated that homes in areas close to more and bigger pig farms were contaminated with more fecal waste This further demonstrates that the pig specific genetic marker found in people s homes is linked to the swine farms the research says This work

adapted for use in other farmed animals such as cows and chickens Providing evidence for lawsuits Alexis Andiman a senior attorney at the environmental law firm Earthjustice says communities who are exposed to pollution from industrial animal facilities need access to data such as that provided by the Pig 2 Bac tool to be able to protect their health Local air pollution data will become increasingly important as the Environmental Protection Agency finalizes new federal rules under the Clean Air Act a bedrock environmental law that factory farms have been shielded from The new rules aim to control air pollution from animal agriculture including hydrogen sulfide ammonia and particulate matter For the past 20 years the EPA has been developing models to enable it to estimate emissions from industrial animal farms During this period the EPA gave factory farms a free pass to pollute without limits or penalties If not for the free pass neighbors of industrial hog operations that have been plagued for decades by hog waste pollution could use this powerful legal tool to hold the industry accountable says Hildebrand Many researchers and activists say the models are long overdue the EPA initially said they would be completed in 2009 The EPA published a draft of the models in November 2024 and is now collecting public comments on the draft When the models are finalized industrial farms will be required to operate with a permit and comply with clean air laws If farms fail to comply with the law communities will be able to use pollutant data to help bring lawsuits against those operations And tools like Pig 2 Bac could help make the case that the pollution is coming from animal operations as opposed to other sources like chemical plants And now that Heaney and Hall s teams have tested and refined the Pig 2 Bac tool it could stand up even better under scrutiny in court Dan Snyder an attorney at the public interest law firm Public Justice who has worked with

New York argued that pig manure was likely also inside the residents homes where they eat and sleep a claim the new Pig 2 Bac study results support In 2018 residents won the case and were initially awarded 50 million in damages and compensation which was later reduced to 2 5 million following a change in state law The Pig 2 Bac tool has also helped researchers argue that toxins from industrial farms in Duplin county travelled into public waterways far off site from operations that were not allowed to discharge pollutants Researchers first developed the Pig 2 Bac tool to track pollution in local wells and rivers Pushing for Change But as communities living in the shadow of industrial animal farms make headway states have strengthened their right to farm laws which shield the agriculture industry from regulation Since 2018 North Carolina and Iowa two states with the most hogs in the country have made it nearly impossible for residents to file nuisance lawsuits against industrial farms And at least seven more have made it more difficult by changing criteria for filing suits or decreasing the amount of damages plaintiffs can recover And now some activists and lawyers are worried the

Elizabeth Southerland Flawed standards In the 1940s and 50s researchers began reporting on a spate of infants with a blue discoloration of their skin Some were also vomiting Others struggled to breathe Several didn t survive The infants were suffering from blue baby syndrome also known as methemoglobinemia MetHb They likely developed the condition after being fed with infant formula made with nitrate contaminated well water concluded researchers and health professionals But the condition can also occur as a genetic disorder MetHb occurs when bacteria in the body convert nitrate a compound of nitrogen and three oxygen atoms into nitrite a compound of nitrogen and two oxygen atoms The nitrite interacts with hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells to form methemoglobin In this form blood is less able to bind oxygen and deliver it around the body Infants are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of excess nitrate because their bodies are more sensitive to nitrate and nitrite and are not yet able to correct the problem The condition can be treated with an intravenous dose of methylene blue a blue colored solution Nitrates in water used to make infant formula can cause infants to develop methemoglobinemia a condition in which they appear blue grey due to lack of oxygen Photo credit Arindam Ghosh on iStock In 1991 the EPA set legal limits on nitrates in drinking water to protect infants from the condition Largely based on two key studies the EPA determined that restricting nitrates in drinking water to 10 milligrams per liter mg L of nitrate nitrogen

drinking water standards for Wisconsin asserts that the nitrate limits are based on a false premise The EPA assumes that infants develop the condition at concentrations of 11 mg L nitrate nitrogen or above He identified several cases where infants developed the condition at much lower levels These include five cases in the state of Iowa where infants developed MetHb at concentrations as low as 0 4 mg L These cases were reported in studies that the EPA considered directly and indirectly when developing its standards Lots of uncertainty There are also other problems with the EPA s nitrate standards The limits don t take account of differences in the way infants respond to nitrate or their susceptibility to MetHb writes Belluck in comments to the EPA Factoring in this variation would lower the limits to ensure that the most vulnerable individuals are protected There is no scientific justification to assume that all infants are the same in their response to nitrate ingestion wrote Belluck Anna Fan a toxicologist and former chief of the pesticide and environmental toxicology branch of California s Environmental Protection Agency wrote that there is little buffer between the legal limit of 10 mg L and the level the EPA says can harm infants In addition the studies that the EPA standard relies on are poor quality and scientifically unreliable suggested Fan and Belluck

However it will not review the risks of MetHb The agency said it only plans to look at possible links to cancer and some other health effects such as thyroid disease that were not considered when the EPA developed the nitrate standards Fifteen years ago EPA scientists recommended the agency evaluate growing evidence of cancer and other health effects from nitrates in drinking water Meanwhile other EPA scientists have long called for changes to the nitrate regulations In an email from 2017 Kimberly Harris who at the time was a health effects specialist at a regional EPA branch that serves states including Wisconsin and Minnesota wrote that her office had been advocating for updates to the nitrate nitrate drinking water regulations for some time But they were told that the risk assessment must precede any reforms she writes The email was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request In 2017 the EPA started the risk assessment but it was suspended two years later by the previous Trump administration due to changes in EPA leadership priorities The Biden administration restarted the program but the nitrate assessment could take several years to complete The EPA says it will decide whether regulatory reforms are needed once the assessment is finished All the while nitrate pollution continues to grow In July last year the EPA released data showing that it found nitrates in over 71 percent of water systems it surveyed nationwide between 2012 and 2019 Of these 2 8 percent exceeded legal limits with some nitrate concentrations reaching over 90 times the limit An earlier

stomach cancer even at concentrations below the legal limits A 2022 analysis found that the risk of stomach cancer linked to nitrate in drinking water nearly doubles as the concentration increases from 0 to 2 26 mg L With each additional 2 26 mg L the risk grows at a faster rate Roberto Picetti an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and lead author of the study

nitrates at mostly low levels were at a 73 higher risk of dying from cancer over a 13 year period compared to people whose drinking water had no detectable nitrates The magnitude of the effect size was shocking said Angelico Mendy an epidemiologist at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and coauthor of the study But although there is strong evidence of a link between stomach cancer and

into waterways violating the law according to an analysis by Food and Water Watch a non governmental organization pursuing corporate and government accountability No area of the state is safe from manure discharging into waterways stated the analysis Industry fights back Meanwhile representatives from the food and agricultural industries are fighting back to deter stricter nitrate controls They argue that nitrates aren t all bad because consuming them in food can boost health In addition they say people get most of their nitrate from food only a small amount comes from drinking water The Fertilizer Institute a trade organization and 21 other agriculture groups including the National Pork Producers Council wrote to the EPA arguing that the current nitrate standard should stay as it is The agriculture and food groups argue that tighter controls would be expensive and not provide any health benefits They point to estimates that halving the permissible levels of nitrates in drinking water could burden customers with additional costs of over 400 million each year To clarify the risks of exposure to nitrates the industry groups urged the EPA to focus its review on the benefits of

questioned some of the dangers of hexavalent chromium a carcinogenic compound used by the steel industry and others and a byproduct of electricity production Independent scientists agree that nitrate and nitrite from food and water should be considered when assessing the overall risk But nitrates in drinking water are more of a health concern they said This is partly because of a crucial

beef is one of the most intensive sources of greenhouse gas emissions Meat companies like Tyson have hired PR firms to clean up their image Credit Darcy Maulsby Producing meat is one of the biggest sources of climate warming gases and beef is the worst of the bunch data shows To clean up their image leading meat producers including Tyson one of the largest meat companies in the United States have hired public relations and advertising firms mirroring a strategy used by fossil fuel companies Now US Right to Know has new details of the PR campaign behind a key part of Tyson s green strategy its so called climate smart beef product branded Brazen Beef In early 2023 Tyson unveiled its climate smart beef which it claimed is produced with 10 fewer greenhouse gasses than regular beef It was the first US produced beef to receive approval from the United States Department of Agriculture for its climate friendly claim Later that year the product was available for purchase from Schweid Sons a burger and ground beef company which had plans to sell it in supermarkets nationwide But shortly after the product s launch e nvironmental groups and media reports called Tyson out for obfuscating how it calculated the cut in climate warming gases to achieve a low emissions beef product And researchers cast doubt on Tyson s ability to measure such slim emissions cuts Other researchers also argued that emissions from beef are so high that even with a 10 cut it could still not be considered climate smart Tyson is also now being sued for making false and misleading claims to consumers regarding its green goals and climate smart beef program from which the Brazen Beef product is produced Tyson s Brazen Beef website has now been taken down and the product appears no longer for sale But the PR and marketing strategy behind the product s promotion provides insight into how the meat industry is trying to appear more sustainable and to capitalize on consumers willingness to pay around 10 but up to 50 more for sustainable products PR and advertising is so important to the company that in 2023 the year it launched Brazen Beef Tyson spent 339 million on it nearly three times as much as it spent on research and development its financial documents show Tyson s claims falsely lead consumers into thinking that they have these products that are better for the climate when in fact

suggested that grazing beef cattle releases fewer climate warming gases compared to industrial beef production where animals are kept in confined spaces and fed on grains such as corn For example grazing cattle on land that is unsuitable for human use and rotating cattle on plots with crops or other livestock can sequester carbon in the soil reducing grazed cattles carbon footprint But in research published in March Eshel and his colleagues re evaluated the amount of soil carbon sequestration that can be reasonably attributed to grass fed cattle Previous studies had overestimated this amount With the new approximation the study shows that grass fed cattle release at least as much greenhouse gas as industrial produced beef By promoting its so called climate smart beef Midan is aiding Tyson to position itself as an honest company with green credentials and alternative environmentally friendly products says Jennifer Jacquet who researches the meat industry s influence on climate change politics and policy at the University of Miami They are involved in enabling it she says False and misleading claims Tyson is also criticized for another aspect of its sustainability strategy which includes a pledge to achieve net zero climate emissions by 2050 To reach this goal Tyson would need to cut or capture as many emissions as it releases which estimates suggest are more than those released by the entire nation of Greece But researchers lawyers and environmental groups say that Tyson s net zero pledge and its climate smart beef claims are deceptive and misleading In September 2024 the Environmental Working Group EWG filed a lawsuit against Tyson for making false and misleading claims to consumers about its net zero emission target and its low emissions beef program The idea that they will get to net neutrality is absurd it s a contradiction in terms says Eshel And even with a 10 reduction in emissions Tyson would still be producing one of the most

says the lawsuit Tyson did not respond to requests for comment In November last year Tyson filed a motion to dismiss the complaint The company argued that EWG s claims are barred by the First Amendment Imposing liability for pursuing a net zero ambition and for making truthful statements about its program to reduce GHG emissions generated from cattle production in Tyson s supply chain goes right to the heart of what the First Amendment protects says a document supporting Tyson s motion to dismiss Tyson also rejects EWG s claim that it has not taken steps to achieve its net zero emissions target Tyson points for example to its participation in the Science Based Targets Initiative an international collaboration to help businesses set goals to reduce emissions and its partnership with a feedlot to collect and assess emissions data In February this year Judge Julie Becker for D C s Superior Court denied Tyson s motion to dismiss the case Judge Becker found that EWG s arguments were strong enough for the case to proceed In the order Judge Becker writes that EWG s allegations are sufficient to support its claim that Tyson s climate smart beef statements give consumers a misleading impression The lawsuit against Tyson follows a similar one against JBS USA the American subsidiary of the world s largest beef producer In February 2024 New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit alleging JBS USA misled consumers when it stated it would achieve net zero greenhouse gases by 2040 It says JBS targeted consumers with fake sustainability claims

Tensions over targets Early drafts of the declaration included concrete global targets to cut the quantity of antimicrobials used in agriculture by at least 30 per cent from countries current levels over the next 6 years Drafts also proposed to eliminate by 2030 the routine use in animals of antimicrobials that are important for human medicine and to gradually phase out the use of these medically important medicines for promoting animal growth But in the final draft of the political declaration dated 9 September the numerical targets are gone Instead member states are required to strive to meaningfully reduce antimicrobials used in the agri food system over the next 6 years among other efforts Documents seen by USRTK show that the governments of the US Canada Australia and New Zealand nations with big meat producing industries objected to the targets In the private UN document dated 6 June which compiles member states objections and proposed changes to the declaration the US suggested deleting the targets as did Canada Australia and New Zealand as a group A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote in a statement The U S government supports ambitious and measurable steps to address AMR in animals and agrees with the goal to reduce and even eliminate inappropriate antimicrobial use in animals However the spokesperson added that the arbitrary nature of setting reduction targets would not take into account uses of antimicrobials that are necessary and appropriate to ensure animal health and welfare To set targets more data on the

USDA Preston Keres Slaughterhouses and meat and poultry processing plants are among the nation s most polluting industries They butcher and prepare around 10 billion animals each year And use large volumes of water to clean carcasses machinery work surfaces and floors The wastewater contains blood and other body residues and is contaminated with the most phosphorus and the second highest levels of nitrogen of all industries found the Environmental Protection Agency EPA By the end of August the EPA has plans to announce new limits on these and other pesky pollutants in wastewater from processing plants that can cause harmful algae blooms kill swaths of fish and expose local communities to bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illness It would be the first time the EPA has updated its wastewater pollution controls for processing facilities in around 20 years The move is a big win for environmental groups who sued the EPA for failing to update the pollution rules In May 2023 the agency and the environmental groups reached a legally binding agreement that obliges the agency to finalize new pollution standards by 31 August There is an enormous volume of waste going straight into waterways and contaminating drinking water It s desperately overdue for regulation says Delcianna Winders director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School The EPA is currently considering comments from industry advocacy groups and others to help shape the rules Meat and poultry companies such as Tyson and Cargill and industry lobby groups are fighting the regulation In a public submission to the EPA the Meat and Poultry Coalition a lobby group that includes the National Pork Producers Council argues that the new rules will be too expensive to implement and will kill tens of thousands of jobs Industry s objections may find support in the new Trump administration which has fired hundreds of EPA employees and vowed to roll back environmental regulations echoing actions to weaken environmental regulations taken in President Trump s first term legal experts warn Alexis Andiman a senior attorney at Earthjustice an environmental law nonprofit that co led the lawsuit against the EPA for failing to update the pollution rules says Trump s EPA may renege on its legal obligation to finalize the rules by the end of August Or it may water down the rules to such an extent that they fail to protect people and the environment she adds Also Congress may move forward with legislation that makes it difficult for the EPA to act For example

Ron Estes R Kansas and Eric Burlison R Missouri introduced a bill into the House last month that seeks to stop the EPA from finalizing and implementing the meat and poultry plant pollution limits It s clear EPA has an obligation to revise the rules and publish pretreatment standards But it s hard to say what they will do says Andiman Huge volumes of nutrient pollution Today around 5 055 or so meat and poultry facilities are operating in the United States The new rules would likely apply to around 17 percent of these up from around 3 percent that are currently covered Most facilities send wastewater to publicly owned treatment works where it is filtered and cleaned to remove contaminants like oil and grease and solid floating particles depending on local rules But in an analysis the EPA found that around 171 facilities discharge wastewater directly into wetlands rivers and streams These include a plant owned by pork giant Smithfield Foods in Tarheel North Carolina and a facility owned by John Morrell and Company in Sioux Falls South Dakota These types of facilities must obtain permits under the Clean Water Act a federal law that regulates water pollution The permits restrict nutrients like nitrogen which cause algae blooms and are linked to certain cancers and other contaminants like oil and grease and solid floating particles Nonetheless most of the water bodies receiving wastewater from these facilities are not in good shape they are plagued with algal growth excess nutrients and depleted oxygen the EPA found Part of the problem is that some facilities release very high levels of pollution In an analysis of the worst offenders the Environmental Integrity Project found that the John Morrell and Company s Sioux Falls plant released 866 874 pounds of nitrogen pollution between 2022 and 2023 the most out of all the facilities The Smithfield plant in Tarheel came in second with 773 553 pounds of nitrogen over the same time frame These volumes are over six times the average annual nitrogen released by meat and poultry facilities Chris Jones an expert in water quality and agricultural waste says these are huge volumes of nutrient pollution Combining the pollution from the Smithfield and John Morrell facilities is enough to contaminate about 80 billion gallons of water beyond the safe drinking water standard for nitrate says Jones

per year says Jones who is author of The Swine Republic an exposé of the science and politics of agriculture and water pollution in the state of Iowa Pollution at these levels can devastate the environment and human health In 2015 a slaughterhouse in Beardstown Illinois owned at the time by Cargill Meat Solutions spilled 29 million gallons of hog waste into ditches and waterways The pollution ended up in the Muscooten Bay and other local waterways killing 64 000 fish The slaughterhouse now owned by JBS was charged 150 000 in fines for unpermitted discharges and agreed to pay an additional 34 000 to a local conservation group writes the EPA And in 2021 residents of Millsboro in Delaware settled a lawsuit with Mountaire Farms for over 200 million after a poultry slaughterhouse that it owned contaminated residents well water used for drinking with harmful bacteria and unsafe levels of nitrates The contamination was linked to gastrointestinal illnesses suffered by residents New rules to limit pollution The new rules that the EPA expects to finalize later this year would tighten limits on nitrogen from large processing facilities that directly discharge into water bodies For example the new rules would require John Morrell s Sioux Falls plant to cut its nitrogen by 92 per cent and Smithfield s Tarheel plant by 88 per cent the EIP calculated The new rules would also restrict phosphorus in wastewater for the first time Phosphorus is another nutrient that causes algae blooms In addition the EPA will set some restrictions on the thousands of meat and poultry facilities that discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment plants These facilities are currently unchecked by any national restrictions on wastewater contaminants Although some are required to meet local limits set by the treatment works or local authorities The agency s new rules would require processing facilities to treat wastewater prior to feeding it to the treatment plants Facilities must meet water quality standards for biological oxygen demand BOD a measure of the amount of oxygen needed for microbes to decompose organic material High levels of BOD can deplete oxygen in the

coming from the meat and poultry facilities The EPA found that some processing facilities have directly caused issues for the treatment works including damaging their cleaning technologies or causing them to violate discharge permits Problematic facilities include the Kiryas Joel Poultry processing plant and the Kiryas Joel Meat Market Corporation in Orange County NY which in 2014 was ordered to pay 330 000 in penalties to settle a lawsuit with the EPA for repeatedly violating the Clean Water Act On numerous occasions between September 2008 and March 2012 the poultry plant discharged large volumes of contaminated wastewater into a local wastewater treatment plant damaging its filters and other cleaning equipment legal documents show The pollution also caused the treatment works to violate its state discharge permit on several occasions when it released contaminated water into a tributary of the Ramapo River The poultry plant wastewater sometimes contained large volumes of blood causing potentially harmful bacteria to pass through the treatment works and into the waterway It also spilled wastewater containing chicken parts fats oils and grease directly into the tributary

well regulated The Institute also disputes the EPA s claim that the industry s wastewater interferes with treatment plant operations or passes through untreated We believe that meat and poultry plant indirect dischargers very rarely if ever cause or contribute significantly to interference or pass through at their publicly owned treatment works writes Bryan Burns general counsel to the Meat Institute in a public submission to the EPA The Meat and Poultry Coalition argues that the agency has underestimated the costs to the industry of complying with the rules It claims that 74 facilities could close and 80 000 people would lose jobs over 4 times the impact that the EPA estimated Complying with the new rules could cost hundreds of millions more than the 232 million per year estimated by the EPA it writes In addition the new standards would upset constructive relationships that meat and poultry facilities have with sewage treatment works the coalition writes Many facilities pay fees to treatment plants to clean their wastewater and to help cover operating and maintenance expenses it writes Will Trump trash the new rules Replogle is hopeful that the EPA will finalize the rules by the August deadline as it is legally required to do But Winders and Bainbridge question whether Trump s EPA will honor the legal agreement The proposed rule is unlikely to fare well under the Trump administration says Bainbridge During its first term the Trump administration rolled back several rules under the Clean Water Act and this term it will likely do more of the same she says

To help ensure that principle is upheld we recognize that public access to information about government actions is critical to sustaining individual and collective freedoms But this year as we notch the 50 th anniversary of the signing of the Freedom of Information Act FOIA mounting evidence shows that many of our federal agencies are actually working to stifle that freedom by wrongfully withholding information from the public In June President Obama signed a bill presumably aimed at strengthening FOIA But while the law offers a range of new procedural improvements the provisions do little to actually prevent the continuation of common abuses and excuses we see from agencies reluctant to turn over information about their activities Attempts to evade the FOIA law have become so routine that the U S Government Accountability Office is convening a team now to begin a broad audit of FOIA compliance at federal agencies The GAO review will get underway this month according to the GAO The investigation comes in response to a directive issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary congressional bodies that have oversight of FOIA operations And it comes after a damning report from the House committee that found the culture of the executive branch of the federal government encourages an unlawful presumption in favor of secrecy when responding to Freedom of Information Act requests Agencies are supposed to act upon and respond to FOIA requesters within 20 working days but anyone who regularly makes FOIA requests knows that it will likely be months if not years before any records are produced If and when records are turned over they often are heavily redacted making them essentially useless The House committee on oversight also found that political pressures often are at play with documents deemed problematic or embarrassing withheld from release Secrecy fosters distrust the committee report noted In their letter to the GAO congressional committee leaders cited an Associated Press analysis that found people who asked for records received censored files or none at all in a record 77 percent of requests last year Overall the Obama administration censored materials it turned over or fully denied access to them in a record 596 095 cases Filing a FOIA these days is a little like stepping

odyssey In January I requested certain records from the Food and Drug Administration regarding a food safety testing program the agency conducts to measure pesticide residues in food When I inquired about the status of my request after the requisite 20 working days had passed the agency told me it was waiting for its drug evaluation unit and its center for veterinary medicine to search for records My protests that the records obviously were not housed in the FDA s drug or veterinary units got me nowhere After several months the FDA acknowledged the request should be assigned to its food safety unit but then I was told a response would be delayed because there was a backlog due to staff changes I was also told some records had to be cleared with the Environmental Protection Agency but the FDA FOIA officer assigned to my request wasn t clear on how to make that referral I ve since been told the agency has found several hundreds of records that are responsive to my request but all I ve actually received are a litany of excuses and delays and a handful of records with several sections blacked out The FDA has repeatedly cited the infamous b 5 exemption which allows agencies to redact information they deem part of a deliberative process The House committee found that the b 5 exemption is misapplied by federal agencies so frequently that it is known as the withhold it because you want to exemption And it s not just federal agencies working to block public access to information that rightfully belongs to the public Many of our public universities have also been found balking at complying with state open records laws The organization I work for the consumer advocacy group U S Right to Know last month filed a lawsuit against the University of California Davis after the university failed for more than a year and a half to turn over public records As well state officials in Michigan were exposed last year promoting the charging of exorbitant fees as a way to

accidental release measures and first aid and firefighting measures according to PEER This is a particular concern for pregnant women according to the PEER complaint Erasing important information On August 26 2021 PEER filed a separate complaint alleging that the EPA has been breaking the law by erasing original versions of internal communications and draft documents and retaining only the final version of key documents The practice violates the Federal Records Act by eliminating details of the decision making process from outside review according to PEER PEER states that that discarding of documents trails is not only contrary to law but also violates the EPA s own records retention policy According to PEER its complaint focuses on two classes of documents Alterations of chemical risk assessments by managers in which both the identity of the manager and the alterations themselves are not apparent and Internal comments related to the development of its Waters of the United States WOTUS rule in which EPA software overwrote the original and allprior versions any time there was an edit Thus only the final version was saved It is as if EPA memorializes its internal decision making

hunger crises in recent times According to a new United Nations report on hunger more than 2 37 billion people did not have adequate access to food in 2020 The Covid 19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in food systems that were already failing to meet the needs of so many people Rather than addressing systemic solutions for hunger and poverty however leaders of the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit are ignoring human rights and pushing to expand genetic engineering and commodity crop monocultures that are deepening the crises and also not feeding the world according to hundreds of groups that are boycotting next week s events and organizing a counter summit All this context is missing from a 7 000 plus word promotional article for genetically engineered foods published this week in the New York Times Magazine Jennifer Kahn reports that overblown fears have turned the public against genetically modified food even though the potential benefits have never been greater She concludes We should all just learn to love GMOs Kahn leads the narrative program at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California Berkeley Her narrative about GMOs hews closely to agrichemical industry talking points were it not for fear mongering consumers and governments insisting on transparency and safety checks they claim GMO technology could fulfill its potential But Kahn missed decades of evidence showing that GMO crops have failed to deliver on the kinds of promises upon which she hung her story We describe some of these examples below Corporations are effectively controlling what food ecosystems emerge once a country decides to rely on biotech gene seeds Kahn also missed concerns about increasing corporate control of seeds privatization of seed stock and concentration of corporate power at the center of the GMO debate U S and European agrichemical companies are exerting pressure on countries in the Global South to accept patented seeds despite massive resistance in those countries For informative reporting on that topic see Renee Alexander and Simran Sethi s article on how Mexico s plan to phase out glyphosate and GMO corn imports could reverse

professor also relied heavily on a discredited source She quoted at length Mark Lynas a writer who has made many inaccurate claims about GMOs and pesticides according to scientists and food policy experts who have written detailed critiques of his work We have compiled the critiques of Lynas here He is a fellow with the Cornell Alliance for Science a public relations campaign funded by the Gates Foundation to convince other countries particularly in Africa to accept GMO seeds and foods In a recent Scientific American article African food movement leaders asked Bill Gates to stop telling Africans what kind of agriculture Africans need The public deserves a more honest conversation about GMOs one that digs deeper than industry spin and examines critical issues of corporate power neocolonialism and food sovereignty The complex nature of GMOs calls for a new conversation UC Berkeley scholar Maywa Montenegro wrote in 2015 An honest discussion of genetically modified organisms must move beyond narrow concepts of human health to the wider social and environmental impacts of engineered crops The need is more relevant today than ever Instead corporations investors and donors pitching techno food and industrial farming are dominating food policy negotiations As Montenegro and her colleagues wrote last month powerful actors have commandeered the UN Food Systems Summit not only to promote a technology driven approach to food systems but also to fragment global food security governance and create institutions more amenable to the demands of agribusiness GMOs a long

context suggesting she is a victim of global injustice Mrs R is in fact a successful farmer who champions agroecological practices and makes a good living according to the report She asked Lynas to remove her image but it remains on his Twitter feed Lynas tactics crossed an ethical red line and must cease according to the report posted by the African Centre for Biodiversity The seed sovereignty group said in a press release that Lynas has a history of mischief making in Tanzania for the agricultural biotech industry lobby His visits to the country are well organized by the lobby using platforms such as the regular meetings of the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa OFAB where the media are in attendance to report on his talks His attacks have principally been directed at the country s biosafety regulations particularly its precautionary approach and strict liability provisions Pesticide industry talking points not science Another example of inaccurate reporting by Lynas is his 2017 article for the Cornell Alliance for Science attacking the World Health Organization s cancer agency for reporting glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen Lynas claimed the expert panel report was a witch hunt and an obvious perversion of both science and natural justice orchestrated by people overcome with hysteria and emotion He claimed glyphosate is the most benign chemical in world farming A fact check by U S Right to Know found that Lynas made misleading and erroneous arguments and relied on two flawed sources including a former chemical industry lobbyist In his defense of Monsanto Lynas also failed to report on the substantial documentary evidence widely reported in the media that Monsanto manipulated the science and regulatory reviews on glyphosate for decades using covert tactics including ghostwriting studies and articles trying to stop independent research pushing dubious science attacking scientists and strong arming regulatory

to discount concerns that Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides cause cancer several new studies are raising questions about the chemical s potential impact on reproductive health An assortment of animal studies released this summer indicate that glyphosate exposures impact reproductive organs and could threaten fertility adding fresh evidence that the weed killing agent might be an endocrine disruptor Endocrine disrupting chemicals may mimic or interfere with the body s hormones and are linked with developmental and reproductive problems as well as brain and immune system dysfunction In a paper published last month in Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology four researchers from Argentina said that studies contradict assurances by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA that glyphosate is safe The new research comes as Bayer is attempting to settle more than 100 000 claims brought in the United States by people who allege exposure to Monsanto s Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicide products caused them to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma The plaintiffs in the nationwide litigation also claim Monsanto has long sought to hide the risks of its herbicides Bayer inherited the Roundup litigation when it bought Monsanto in 2018 shortly before the first of three trial victories for plaintiffs The studies also come as consumer groups work to better understand how to reduce their exposure to glyphosate through diet A study published Aug 11 found that after switching to an organic diet for just a few days people could cut the levels of glyphosate found in their urine by more than 70 percent Notably the researchers found that the children in the study had much higher levels of glyphosate in their urine than did the adults Both adults and children saw large drops in the presence of the pesticide following the diet change Glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup is the most widely used weed killer in the world Monsanto introduced glyphosate tolerant crops in the 1990s to encourage farmers to spray glyphosate directly over whole fields of crops killing weeds but not the genetically altered crops The widespread use of glyphosate by farmers as well as homeowners utilities and public entities has drawn growing concern over the years because of its pervasiveness and fears about what it could be doing to human and environmental health The chemical is now found commonly in food and water and in human urine According to the Argentinian scientists some of the reported effects of glyphosate seen in the new animal studies are due to exposure to high doses but there is new evidence showing that even low dose exposure could also alter the development of the female reproductive tract with consequences on fertility When animals are exposed to glyphosate before puberty alterations are seen in the development and differentiation of ovarian follicles and the uterus the scientists said Additionally", "chunk_id":

the scientists said Additionally exposure to herbicides made with glyphosate during gestation could alter the development of the offspring It all adds up to show that glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides are endocrine disruptors the researchers concluded Agricultural scientist Don Huber professor emeritus from Purdue University said the new research expands on knowledge about the potential scope of damage associated with glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides and provides a better grasp of understanding the seriousness of the exposure that is ubiquitous in our culture now Huber has warned for years that Monsanto s Roundup might be contributing to fertility problems in livestock One noteworthy study published online in July in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology determined that glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides disrupted critical hormonal and uterine molecular targets in exposed pregnant rats A different study recently published in the journal Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology by researchers from Iowa State University looked at glyphosate exposure in mice The researchers concluded that chronic low level exposure to glyphosate alters the ovarian proteome a set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell or organism and may ultimately impact ovarian function In a related paper from the same two Iowa State researchers and one additional author published in Reproductive Toxicology the researchers said they did not find endocrine disrupting effects in the mice exposed to glyphosate however Researchers from the University of Georgia reported in the journal Veterinary and Animal Science that consumption by livestock of grain laced with glyphosate residues appeared to carry potential harm for the animals according to a review of studies on the topic Based on the literature review glyphosate based herbicides appear to act as reproductive toxicants having a wide range of effects on both the male and female reproductive systems the researchers said Alarming results were also seen in sheep A study published in the journal Environmental Pollution looked at the impacts of glyphosate exposure on the development of the uterus in female lambs They found changes that they said might affect the female reproductive health of sheep and show glyphosate based herbicides acting as an endocrine disruptor Also published in

herbicides from the ages of 10 days to 52 weeks The researchers concluded that the glyphosate herbicides could modulate key physiological pathways antioxidant status testosterone and the microbiome but they did not detect effects on reproduction They said the effects of glyphosate may not always be visible with traditional especially short term toxicology testing and such testing may not fully capture the risks Glyphosate and Neonicotinoids One of the newest studies looking at glyphosate impacts on health was published this month in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health Researchers concluded that glyphosate as well as the insecticides thiacloprid and imidacloprid were potential endocrine disruptors The insecticides are part of the neonicotinoid class of chemicals and are among the most heavily used insecticides in the world The researchers said that they monitored the effect of glyphosate and the two neonicotinoids on two critical targets of the endocrine system Aromatase the enzyme responsible for estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen receptor alpha the main protein promoting estrogen signaling Their results were mixed The researchers said with respect to glyphosate the weed killer inhibited aromatase activity but the inhibition was partial and weak Importantly the researchers said glyphosate did not induce estrogenic activity The results were consistent with the screening program conducted by U S Environmental Protection Agency which concluded that there is no convincing evidence of a potential interaction with the estrogen pathway for glyphosate they said The researchers did see estrogenic activity with imidacloprid and thiacloprid but at concentrations higher than the pesticide levels measured in human biological samples The researchers concluded that low doses of these pesticides should not be considered harmless however because these pesticides together with other endocrine disrupting chemicals might cause an overall estrogenic effect The varying findings come as many countries and localities around the world evaluate whether or not to limit or ban continued use of glyphosate herbicides A California appeals court ruled last month that there was abundant evidence that glyphosate together with the other ingredients in Roundup products caused cancer", "chunk_id":
