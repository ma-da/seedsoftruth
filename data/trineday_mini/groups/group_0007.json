The border to the French zone was only a few kilometers away, and the Belarus Brigade took the hint. That evening they noticed that every American guard had been pulled away from the camp perimeter.65 By morning they had fl ed to other DP camps or moved to the French zone. In early October 1945, Patton was relieved of command of the Third Army and as Military Governor of Bavaria by General Eisenhower. He was given command of the Fifteenth Army, which was largely concerned with historical research and controlled no divisions or occupation area. Among the reasons for Patton’s removal from Bavaria was his failure to cooperate with the denazifi cation program. In December, he was fatally injured in a motor accident. For many of the Nazi collaborators, the postwar months in the French zone were an idyllic time. A Byelorussian school was opened, and a sort of Nazi community in exile was established. The men who had presided over the mass murder of the Jews in Byelorussia were now safely ensconced as employees of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA). Stanislaw Stankievich was hired as an English-language teacher for the camps.66 Dimitri Kasmowich, former police chief of the Smolensk region and commander of one of Skorzeny’s “special” units, was a refugee rations offi cer. Throughout the occupied zones, the French and British intelligence organizations sought jobs for their new assets with UNRRA in the camps. It was not only good cover but provided extra funds, since the British and French had no money to pay a large retinue of ex-Nazi puppets. These jobs were often a cover for the real work as recruiters for the Polish Military Mission. The Polish mission itself was an arm of the British and French secret services, which sought to provide assistance to the government-in-exile in London. Throughout 1945 and 1946 a task force composed of several of the original Einsatzgruppen guides reestablished contact with the now scattered elements of the Belarus Brigade and other Eastern European collaborators hiding in the DP camps. The Byelorussian collaborators had been given false identity cards showing that they were discharged Polish offi cers.

Bartishevic’s staff apparently made new identities for each of the leaders of the BCC just before the war ended. Most of the members of the Belarus simply changed their names from the Byelorussian spelling to the Polish, and the confusing conversion from the Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin was enough to conceal their identities. Ostrowsky replaced Astrouski, Jasiuk replaced Yasyuk, Sobolewsky replaced Sabaleuski, Franz Kushel replaced Frantzishak Kusiel. The forging operation had intelligence implications as well. Large numbers of Byelorussian Nazis had been trapped behind enemy lines, and all through the summer and fall of 1945 survivors came trickling into the western Allied zones of Germany. Travel through the Soviet zone was still possible: Some German units were operating in the chaotic rear areas despite the end of the war. Each arrival often brought news of Soviet military activity and troop movements. The Byelorussians combined these bits of gossip and fact and printed them up to look like captured Soviet documents. Those who had served with Ostrowsky in Vorkommando Moskau had ample experience with real Soviet documents when they pillaged the offi ces of the Minsk NKVD in 1941. A large number of these authentic but out-of-date documents had been taken to Germany when the Byelorussian collaborators fl ed in 1944. By mixing real documents with the newly concocted reports, the Byelorussians hoped to convince the Allies that they possessed an active spy network behind the Soviet borders. The sale of the documents from the Byelorussian paper mills brought in a sizable income during the fi rst years after the end of the war. After 1946, however, the last trickle of border-crossers was cut off by the Soviets, and the Byelorussians lost most of their contacts with the homeland. Realizing that the Allies could not offi cially embrace a government created by the Nazis, Ostrowsky called the fugitives out of hiding at the end of 1945 to create another front organization.67 He told a special meeting of the Byelorussian Central Council that it would be in their best interests to dissolve the government in order to avoid being sent back to Byelorussia as war criminals. In fact, following Patton’s removal from command, the Third Army had forcibly repatriated 243 Soviet nationals who had fought for Germany during the war. The BCC changed its name to the Byelorussian Central Representation (BCR) and within a month was operating in the British zone under the new name but the same leadership.

But whatever unity had prevailed among the exiles was already splintering.68 Factionalism is the bane of émigré political organizations. Increasingly remote from the reality of their homelands, the exiles exist in a hothouse atmosphere that breeds a mixture of intrigue and paranoia. Each faction becomes convinced that it alone is the legitimate instrument of struggle for national liberation, and the fi ghts between them take on the bitterness of a family argument. This is exactly what happened among the Byelorussians. The western, Polish faction was growing more and more uncomfortable with Ostrowsky’s leadership, complaining that he was too visible a target because he was widely known as the leader of a Nazi puppet government. It split off and formed its own organization under Abramtchik. Unlike Ostrowsky, Abramtchik had worked secretly for the Gestapo and the SS, and his role as a Nazi collaborationist was not widely known.69 To be sure, he had participated in Ostrowsky’s government-in-exile in Berlin as Intelligence Minister, but it would be diffi cult to connect him with the atrocities committed in Byelorussia. Moreover, Abramtchik had a front organization of his own to offer the Allies, the Byelorussian National Republic, which had been established following the Russian Revolution and had set itself up as a government-in-exile in Paris. As soon as Abramtchik reestablished the BNR in Paris in 1946 he went to work usurping Ostrowsky’s position with the British secret service. By the middle of the year, émigré newspapers were reporting that the BNR was being funded by a combination of anticommunist groups, including the Vatican and the London-based Polish government-in-exile. Far from being a front for funding from the British secret service, as the Soviets have suggested, the London Poles were desperately maneuvering on their own to regain control of a country that was rapidly falling under Communist infl uence. One of their methods was to fi nance groups that held themselves out as possible sources of resistance to Communist control. The Vatican supplied support to Abramtchik’s group because many members were Catholics from the former Polish provinces of Byelorussia.70 A special school was established in the Vatican to encourage their postwar nationalism. The curriculum eventually included parachute training, and there is an apocryphal story about a headline in the Vatican newspaper reading “They Fall from the Skies like Angels.” Bitter infi ghting erupted among the various Byelorussian factions as they struggled against each other for recognition and fi nancial aid from Western intelligence agencies.

They were like salesmen competing for a lucrative account. Ostrowsky’s Orthodox supporters were opposed to Abramtchik‘s links to the Vatican; Abramtchik told the British and French that their opponents, loyal to the Moscow patriarchy, were secretly manipulated by the “Communist” Orthodox Church. Abramtchik soon hit upon a more effective technique: quietly, the word was spread that many of Ostrowsky’s followers were war criminals. In order to avoid public scandals, both the British and French cut their links to Ostrowsky and adopted the “moderate” Abramtchik faction as their channel for dealing with the Byelorussians.[3] Ostrowsky appeared to have been left out in the cold, but it was not long before he found new sponsors – Reinhard Gehlen and the Americans. Along with the cream of Nazi rocket scientists and engineers, Gehlen was one of the prize catches of American military intelligence. $\\underline { { 7 1 } }$ As head of FHO, he had amassed a huge amount of information about the Soviet Union.[4] Even after the Germans were driven from Russia, Gehlen coordinated the processing of intelligence from the Nazi spy network that had remained behind Soviet lines. Realizing at the war’s end that he would be sought by the Russians for punishment even though he claimed never to have been a Nazi, he made plans to ensure his survival by placing with the Allies his vast storehouse of information on the Soviet Union. Like many other Germans, he was convinced that it was only a matter of time before the alliance between the Russians and the West would collapse. In anticipation of that day, Gehlen microfi lmed his entire Soviet intelligence fi le, stored the microfi lm in steel boxes – some fi fty in all – and buried them in the Bavarian Alps in the path of the advancing Americans, to whom he and his staff surrendered in May 1945. Once Gehlen’s identity was established, General Edwin L. Sibert, the Twelfth Army Group’s chief of intelligence, consulted with Allen Dulles, then OSS station chief in Germany. Unlike many generals who distrusted the civilian intelligence service, Sibert respected Dulles’s judgment. Both men agreed that Gehlen would be a prize beyond measure.

Through him, American intelligence would obtain an unprecedented opportunity to develop an anticommunist network in Soviet territory. Fearing that the Russians, who were searching for Gehlen to settle old scores, might get wind of the fact that he was in American hands, the military decided to send him to Washington for extended interrogation. Much to Gehlen’s amusement, the Americans gave him the uniform of an American general to wear as he was spirited aboard a plane in an attempt to avert the attention of Soviet agents. Upon his arrival in America on August 22, 1945, he was put in civilian clothes and installed as an honored prisoner in the interrogation center at Fort Hunt, just across the Potomac from Washington, where Nazi VIP’s, such as Gustav Hilger, were interviewed. There, Gehlen received a steady stream of visitors from the faction-ridden American intelligence community, each of whom had his own ideas how this windfall should best be used. From their conversations and from the Washington newspapers he was permitted to read, Gehlen discovered that his interrogation coincided with an intense struggle among U.S. intelligence agencies for control of future operations. Rather than being a supplicant, he now found himself the center of a bureaucratic tug-of-war. The American intelligence system was almost as complex as the Nazi apparatus, and the infi ghting among its members was equally Byzantine. Until World War II, the United States had no centralized intelligence agency. There were the Army’s G-2, the Navy’s ONI, the State Department’s small “research bureau,” and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s activities in domestic counterespionage. The devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor spot-lighted the lack of cooperation among these agencies and the vital need for coordination. President Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Offi ce of Strategic Services to meet this need and appointed Colonel William J. Donovan, a World War I hero and an old classmate from Columbia Law School, as its head.72 “Wild Bill” Donovan shaped the OSS in his own image. Flamboyant and daring, he recruited agents from among Wall Street law fi rms, Ivy League schools, and big corporations. The old-line military intelligence agencies, contemptuous of the new organization, claimed its initials stood for “Oh So Social.” Nevertheless, after a shaky start, the OSS achieved a credible record in the secret war against the Nazis and the Japanese. Impressed with the success of the OSS, Roosevelt planned, as the war neared its end, to create a permanent, centralized intelligence organization with Donovan’s agency as its nucleus. But he had failed to reckon with J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime chief of the FBI.[5] Hoover believed that he, rather than Donovan, should head such an intelligence apparatus.

But he had failed to reckon with J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime chief of the FBI.[5] Hoover believed that he, rather than Donovan, should head such an intelligence apparatus. A plan prepared by Donovan for the President’s consideration was leaked to the rabidly anti-Roosevelt Chicago Tribune, which warned that FDR was trying to create an “American Gestapo.” Following Roosevelt’s death, the generals and admirals who had also resented Donovan’s power persuaded President Truman to disband the OSS as of October 1, 1945.73 The surviving intelligence agencies began competing for the remains of Donovan’s organization. The War Department took over the OSS counterintelligence section, where it became the Strategic Services Unit after its entire staff threatened to resign if they were forced to work for Hoover.74 As a result, the task of detecting Soviet spies became split between the FBI and the Army, a division that would later have tragic consequences. The State Department obtained the political intelligence section of OSS, including all its fi les.[6] Reinhard Gehlen benefi ted from this struggle. Each of the American agencies coveted his services, and he dictated a high price for them. Gehlen entered into a pact with the U.S. government and returned to Germany in July 1946, where he was permitted to establish his own intelligence empire. He was under contract to the Americans with the understanding that once a German government was established he would be transferred to its authority. (On April 1, 1956, Gehlen became chief of the Bundesnachtrichtendienst (BND), the offi cial intelligence service of the Federal Republic; he retired in 1968.) The U.S. Army and Navy, State Department, and the FBI were each to receive the intelligence Gehlen produced, but access to his original sources would be strictly limited. Gehlen had good reason to be cautious. He needed to keep the Americans from learning how badly his organization had been penetrated by the Soviets during the war. He possessed a pipeline to the Soviet Union all right, but it would be years before the Allies learned that the pipeline fl owed in both directions. Upon his return to Germany, Gehlen began to reassemble his staff of intelligence analysts at his headquarters at Oberursel, near Frankfurt. Former members of the FHO staff in American prisoner-of-war cages were surreptitiously released to Gehlen’s custody. American military law prohibited him from employing war criminals and ex-members of the SS or the Gestapo, which had been indicted as criminal organizations at the Nuremberg Trials, but Gehlen reasoned that what the Americans did not know would not hurt them.

Blacklisted men were hired and given aliases and false personal documents so he could claim he knew nothing about their past associations. Only one problem remained: Where would Gehlen obtain suffi cient amounts of raw intelligence for his machine to digest and process? The Americans were pressing for immediate results to justify the substantial amount of money, not to mention the risk involved, in setting up the Gehlen organization. Gehlen had a solution. During much of the war, the headquarters of FHO had been in Smolensk, part of the territory that was intended by the Nazis for absorption into Byelorussia. The leader of the collaborators in Smolensk was an energetic Byelorussian nationalist named Radoslaw Ostrowsky, who had impressed Gehlen and commanded a network of secret informers who could provide a great deal of intelligence. Gehlen learned that Ostrowsky was hiding in the British zone and proposed a plan for collaboration. In return for information collected by Ostrowsky’s network in the displaced persons camps, Gehlen offered him the prospect of protection from prosecution for war crimes, courtesy of his American sponsors. [4]Early in 1945 General Heinz Guderian, the chief of staff on the eastern front, presented Hitler with a survey of the deteriorating military situation and the strength of the Soviet armies prepared by Gehlen. “Completely idiotic!” the Fuhrer shouted, and demanded that Gehlen be committed to an insane asylum. Guderian angrily replied that Gehlen was “one of my best staff offi cers” and said he would not have shown the report to Hitler if he were not in agreement with it. “If you want General Gehlen sent to a lunatic asylum,” he declared, “then you’d better have me certifi ed as well.” Hitler relented, but after this both Guderian and Gehlen were on his blacklist (Guderian, Panzer Leader [E.P. Dutton, 19521,p. 387). [5] The rivalry between the FBI and OSS was intense. When Hoover learned that the OSS had penetrated the Spanish embassy in Washington and was secretly photographing code books and other documents belonging to the Franco regime, he decided to put an end to it. One night after the OSS had broken into the embassy, two FBI cars pulled up in front of the building and turned on their sirens. The entire neighborhood was awakened, and the shaken interlopers fl ed. Donovan protested to the White House, but instead of reprimanding Hoover, the President ordered the infi ltration project turned over to the FBI.

Harris Smith, OSS: The Secret History of America’s First Central Intelligence Agency, University of California Press, 1972, p. 20). [6] The State Department’s intelligence operation was unable to rival the military’s growing dominance of the fi eld because it was hampered by congressional charges that some of the transferees from the OSS had “strong Soviet leanings” (William R. Corson, The Armies of Ignorance, Dial Press, 1977, p. 272). Gehlen and Ostrowsky had much in common. Both had the knack of survival, and both were professional conspirators who would serve any master to achieve their goals. And they both had an inordinate amount of luck. Their secret alliance was cemented at a time when their American benefactors were deciding to get into the intelligence business in a massive way. By early 1946 President Truman realized he had made an error in dismantling the OSS and he undertook the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. “Confl icting intelligence reports fl owing across my desk from the various departments left me confused and irritable, and monumentally uninformed,” he complained.75 The fi rst step was the organization of a Central Intelligence Group to regulate the information that fl owed into the White House from the State Department, the military services, the FBI, and a myriad of other sources.76 The President wanted an intelligence service that would tell him what the Russians were up to. But Truman’s choice as Director of Central Intelligence was less than inspired. Although Truman was an admirable man in many ways, the President’s idea of good government was to give a friend a job. Rear Admiral Sidney W. Souers was one of Truman’s poker cronies who had owned the Piggly Wiggly stores in Memphis and then operated an insurance offi ce in St. Louis before offering his wartime services to the Navy. Two days after Souers was sworn in there was a party at the White House in which Truman jokingly presented him with a black hat, a cloak, and a wooden dagger. Souers was out of his depth and was replaced within six months by Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, who had commanded the Ninth Air Force in Africa and Europe. He was no stranger to Soviet affairs, having served as chief of the U.S. Air Mission to Russia from 1943 to 1944.

Vandenberg viewed the CIG as a stepping-stone to a fourth star and the post of Chief of Staff of the Air Force as soon as it was created, but during his one year as DCI he built an intelligence empire. He was not hampered by the fact that he was the nephew of Arthur H. Vandenberg, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When aides presented the general with a proposal for a research department with a staff of eighty, he sent it back with an order to come up with a plan for eight hundred employees. Vandenberg’s most important acquisition was the OSS intelligence operation, which had been transferred to the War Department at the time of the dismantling of Donovan’s agency. It was renamed the Offi ce of Special Operations (OSO) and brought with it a staff of a thousand people. The CIG also shared supervision, along with the Army’s G-2 Military Intelligence Service, of the Gehlen organization and the fruits of its efforts.[1] Gehlen was delighted by the scope of Vandenberg’s vision, and foresaw a signifi cant increase in his funding and mission. Omitting the Nazi backgrounds of his recruits, Gehlen informed his new employers that there was a network of Byelorussians operating in the DP camps which would like to assist the Allies. In return for recognition of their anticommunist nationalist movement, the Byelorussians would secretly target Communist spies working in the émigré community. The proposal attracted interest, because for some time Soviet espionage had been dramatically increasing among the exiles. Gehlen originated Operation Tobacco, a plan to use Byelorussian informants to help the Army’s Counter-Intelligence Corps to smoke out Soviet agents. He hoped not only to ingratiate himself with the CIG, but also to neutralize the increasing pressure from the Nazi hunters of the CIC. Gehlen fl ooded the Americans with “authentic” documents provided by the Byelorussians. Because the information pertained to Soviet activity in areas where verifi cation was impossible, the Americans had no choice but to view Gehlen’s information as genuine. In reality, most of the “secret” intelligence that Gehlen furnished was gossip from recently arrived émigrés who had just been released from a Russian POW camp, Soviet newspapers, and mail from Byelorussia and the Ukraine, which was permitted to continue with only varying degrees of censorship until 1948.

Much of Gehlen’s information concerned the DP camps themselves. Hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and survivors of Nazi brutality lived in these camps. The International Refugee Organization was making heroic attempts to feed and clothe them until a permanent solution could be found. With the German economy in ruins, cigarettes and chocolate were the main items of exchange, and there was a thriving black market.[2] For a few years after the war, blackmarketing and espionage were among the chief means of livelihood. It was normal for Gehlen to pay his informants with goods from the American PX which they could then resell at a substantial mark up. Entire communities of refugees in post-war Germany scoured the DP camps for tiny shreds of gossip which Gehlen could resell to the ever gullible Americans. But in the early post war years, all the Army had were suspicions. These suspicions were heightened when the CIC stumbled across some of Gehlen’s agents in its denazifi cation sweeps. No one in their right mind would use a fugitive Nazi collaborator as a spy: he could too easily be turned or blackmailed. Time after time, CIC agents arrested Nazis hiding in the DP camps, only to have the suspect produce a special card with a phone number to Gehlen’s military liaison.77 Invariably, higher headquarters would order the CIC to release the Nazis. It did no good for the CIC to protest that Gehlen’s men were ex-Nazis who were suspected of selling the same information to the Soviets. By now Washington had become addicted to Gehlen’s reports, and he could claim his successes. For example, Gehlen’s interrogations of German soldiers straggling home from Russian prison camps occasionally produced signifi cant intelligence. Some had worked in Soviet factories and mines, others on rebuilding dams and highways. By piecing together bits of information obtained from these interrogations, Gehlen was able to deduce a signifi cant portion of Soviet plans for reconstructing its military and economic machinery. One of the POWs brought back with him an ordinary-looking piece of ore that turned out to be fragments of pitchblende, from which uranium can be extracted and which was thought to be unknown in the Soviet Union.

They were simply telling the gullible Americans what they wanted to hear. Within two years after Germany’s surrender the Byelorussian Nazis had, with Gehlen’s assistance, virtually seized control of the DP camps in which they lived. $\\underline { { 7 8 } }$ The ex-Nazi inmates were running the intelligence asylum. Most of the Belarus Brigade had been reassembled at Regensburg and Michelsdorf, where Franz Kushel acted as camp coordinator. Kushel organized military training units in the camps; to evade regulations forbidding such organizations, the units were disguised as Boy Scout troops and veterans’ social clubs.79 Stanislaw Stankievich ran the Osterhofen camp. Those who resisted his authority were cut off from food rations. Osterhofen contained a large number of refugees unconnected to the Belarus underground and when they protested to the American authorities about the brutality of Stankievich’s regime, their complaints were ignored. Some of the protesters were beaten by Stankievich’s thugs. Stankievich had never been elected camp leader, as required by the IRO rules, but those who demanded a free election were told by the U.S. military representative that there would be no changes. Eventually the dissidents were transferred to other camps. A dual camp system was being established – one for legitimate refugees, who barely survived, and another for privileged refugees like the members of the Belarus Brigade. Under the guise of realigning the DP locations along ethnic lines to facilitate administration, the Byelorussian and Ukrainian collaborators were given their own private camps. The Backnang, Michelsdorf, Osterhofen, and Aschaffenburg camps all came under the control of one or another of the Byelorussian factions. Ex-Nazi collaborators who were now employed by the Gehlen organization were placed in charge of these camps, and they obtained jobs as schoolteachers, rations distributors, translators, and clerks. The sale of secrets was a cottage industry, and some of them worked not only for Gehlen but for other intelligence services as well. One of the most embarrassing examples of multiple loyalties surfaced when the Americans conceived of the idea of “repatriating” their own agents into the Soviet zone to collect intelligence. Gehlen provided the Americans with the services of Jury Bartishevic, the man who ran the Byelorussian forgery operation.

One of the most embarrassing examples of multiple loyalties surfaced when the Americans conceived of the idea of “repatriating” their own agents into the Soviet zone to collect intelligence. Gehlen provided the Americans with the services of Jury Bartishevic, the man who ran the Byelorussian forgery operation. It was he who provided false documents to enable the Nazis to hide in the American zone. After his ruse was eventually discovered, the Americans asked Bartishevic to prepare suffi cient documents to enable their Russian-speaking agents to move freely through the Soviet zone. The enterprising Bartishevic printed several duplicates of each forged document, which he promptly resold to a number of willing purchasers, including the Soviets. Thus, the Soviet border guards had a list of the false identities used by American spies, and picked them up as soon as they crossed the border into the Russian zone. When Bartishevic’s duplicity was uncovered he was dismissed, and a scathing comment was placed in his fi le at the CIC central registry to the effect that Bartishevic’s loyalty would follow whoever paid him.[3] This was apparently a dig at the all-too-visible lack of coordination among the many organizations which sought to develop an intelligence presence among the refugee populations in Germany. Fighting Russians with Russians was a concept that had long intrigued American Army intelligence. The Army hoped to build an underground force to disrupt the Soviet empire in advance of the inevitable confl ict between East and West. In preparation for this mission, the European Command Intelligence School (EUCOM G-2) had been assembling Eastern European experts, particularly Ukrainians, as the nucleus for such a force. But the paramilitary units that could actually conduct this secret war were lacking. Even Gehlen was no help because his charter limited him to gathering and analyzing information rather than engaging in covert military activities. During the fi rst years of his operation he had successfully concealed the fact – despite CIC probing – that most of the refugee sources he had recruited were members of the Nazi underground community and perpetrators of atrocities. But early in 1947 the Americans accidentally discovered the key to the Belarus network. The disclosure came about when Dr. Friedrich Buchardt, who was wanted as a major war criminal, emerged from hiding with an offer designed to save himself from execution.80 Buchardt had been one of Dr. Franz Six’s assistants in Einsatzgruppe B, and had later commanded a detachment of the mobile killing units in the Minsk and Smolensk areas. Toward the end of the war, Buchardt became chief of “émigré affairs” of the SS.

In this post he acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of the role of the various Eastern European and Russian collaborators. Most of the other Einsatzgruppen commanders had already been captured and were awaiting trial before the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal on charges of having systematically liquidated millions of Jews and other Eastern Europeans. Buchardt offered to trade a secret history of SS operations in Russia, with particular emphasis on the work of the native collaborators, in exchange for help from Army intelligence in avoiding punishment for his crimes. Omitting no details, Buchardt described how his colleague Dr. Six had recruited the Byelorussian collaborators in Warsaw and had imported about thirty of them along with the fi rst wave of the invasion. He named several – including Ostrowsky, Kushel, and Stankievich – and described in detail the functioning of Ostrowsky’s government. The manuscript was also a manual on the art of psychological warfare and the winning over of an occupied population through the effective use of collaborators. All the mistakes made by the Nazis during the occupation of Russia were enumerated, and methods were discussed to avoid repeating them during a future occupation. Buchardt arranged for a copy of his manuscript to be passed on to Alexander Dallin of Army intelligence, and it was rapidly handed up the chain of command until it reached the offi ce of the Army Chief of Staff for Intelligence in the Pentagon where it was immediately classifi ed Top Secret and placed in a special safe for sensitive documents. Buchardt was taken under the wing of Army intelligence and the U.S. government thus recruited a major war criminal. With few exceptions, the other Einsatzgruppen commanders were sentenced to death at Nuremberg. Army intelligence protected Buchardt so effectively that no further trace of him has been found. [Years later I found Buchardt’s manuscript in the Top Secret vaults in Suitland, and traced his recruitment to then Professor Alexander Dallin, Chair of the History Department at Stanford. Dallin frantically confessed that Buchardt had been taken by the CIA, presumably OPC, but no further trace of him was found. Although Buchardt’s name as an Einsatzgruppen commander originally appeared in one of the most noted histories of the Holocaust, it was mysteriously deleted in later editions. But at the time Dallin received Buchardt’s manuscript, it was considered the key to unlocking the secrets of the Soviet Union.] The Army soon linked the names in Buchardt’s manuscript to the Byelorussians living in the DP camps.

Within a month after the manuscript was received in the Pentagon a courier from the Polish Military Mission in France was caught passing sensitive information to the Polish Communists. The courier claimed to be a double agent for Free Polish Intelligence, jointly supported by the French and the British, and was trying to penetrate the Communist intelligence service. He said he had been requested by the Polish Communists to establish the whereabouts of the former leaders of the Byelorussian Central Council, and to ascertain whether or not they were working with any Western intelligence agency. The courier had contacted Kushel, Stankievich, and other leading members of the western Byelorussian faction, and had obtained a list showing the residence of several cabinet-level collaborators. This list matched the names in Buchardt’s manuscript. Kushel and the others had willingly furnished it to the courier to establish his bona fi des as a spy. The Byelorussians realized Soviet agents were monitoring their activities and would have secured the information anyway.81 Up until this time, the Americans had no knowledge of the importance of the Byelorussians to Soviet intelligence. The Russians had made no request for their arrest, and their names had never been published on any list of wanted war criminals. The Soviets seemed content to track their every move but not to disclose an interest. This was surprising, as the Soviets had previously relished publishing the names of eastern European Nazis given sanctuary in the American zone. Curiously, the Soviets kept their silence about the Belarus Brigade only until their courier was captured. Primed by the information in Buchardt’s manuscript, Army intelligence launched a crash program to learn everything it could about the Byelorussians, who seemed made to order for a guerrilla campaign against the Soviet Union. But the Americans faced serious problems in enlisting the Byelorussians for a secret war. One problem was that the various factions showed no inclination to cease their internecine feuding. More importantly, however, the United States was offi cially committed to the policy of repatriation for all Russian war criminals, including Byelorussians. With the trials of the Einsatzgruppen commanders soon to begin at Nuremberg, this was hardly the time for the Pentagon to reveal that it had recruited any of their colleagues. And the Soviets chose this moment to break their silence regarding the Byelorussian Nazis.

Few of the UN delegates realized, however, that the denunciation was a skirmish in the rapidly heating Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West. The Government of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic has available a substantial list of German fascist criminals and their accomplices who committed crimes on the temporarily occupied territory of Byelorussia [the Byelorussian delegate declared]. Some of the criminals are still hiding in camps for displaced persons, while others are living on in the western zones of Germany and Austria, where they are forming all kinds of organizations hostile to Soviet Byelorussia and engaging in subversive activity against the United Nations. A “Byelorussian Committee” … also operates at Regensburg (in the United States zone of occupation). This “Committee” has a considerable number of members who committed crimes against the Byelorussian people [among them] … Lieutenant-Colonel Franz Kushel, who lives in Amberg (United States zone of occupation), and who, during the German occupation of Byelorussia, was a member of the so-called “Byelorussian Central Council” set up by the fascists. Kushel was one of the most active workers of the “Byelorussian Territorial Defence Organization,” which took part in the fi ghting against the Soviet Army and the Byelorussian partisans. With Franz Kushel lives his wife Arsenieva, one of the chief contributors to the fascist newspaper Ranitsa, which was published in Berlin by the German authorities and called for bloody reprisals against the unyielding Byelorussian people…. The following members of the “Byelorussian Central Council” which existed during the German occupation of Byelorussia are also at Amberg: Evgeni Kolubovich (or Geny Golubovich), who worked as head of the Department of Culture and Propaganda of the “Byelorussian Central Council”; Stanislaw Stankievich, who was chief of the Borissow district at the time of the German occupation, directed the massacre of the innocent inhabitants of this district, and afterwards became editor of the fascist newspaper Ranitsa; Yosif Dashkevich, who served as an SS captain and conducted punitive operations against the population of the Slonim district of the region of Baranovichi; and many others whose hands are stained with the blood of the Byelorussian people.

He is Radoslaw Ostrowsky, whose misdeeds the Byelorussian people will never forgive, wherever he may hide and whoever may hide him…. Bandera was advised by military intelligence to go underground while the CIC searched for him. Stankievich constituted a more diffi cult problem. The CIC picked him up in 1948 for “aggressive interrogation,” and upon being shown a copy of Ranitsa with his name on the masthead, he broke down and sobbed out a partial confession.84 While Stankievich acknowledged having held numerous posts in the occupation regime, he did not mention the atrocities committed while he held those positions. The staff of General Lucius D. Clay, the military governor of the American Zone in Germany, persuaded the CIC not to prosecute, pointing out that Stankievich was now working for British intelligence. The CIC agreed, and Clay’s intelligence staff notifi ed Washington that Stankievich was merely an anticommunist politician whom the Soviets wished to discredit. “All other indicated fi les … disclosed no derogatory information,” the letter said.[4] Meanwhile, the American intelligence establishment was undergoing another shake-up. In September 1947 the Central Intelligence Group became the Central Intelligence Agency, with a greatly enlarged fi eld of operations.85 Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, Vandenberg’s successor at the CIG, was named its head. Unlike his predecessors, the admiral had considerable intelligence experience, which he had garnered in the Pacifi c during the war, and he was fl uent in German. Army intelligence, which lost its share of the supervision of the Gehlen organization to the CIG, was determined to prevent further erosion of its privileged position in the intelligence community. Military intelligence was particularly alarmed about the infl uence of old OSS hands in the civilianoriented CIA, for the Army had always regarded the OSS as too liberal in its political coloration. Many of the G-2 staff were convinced that the OSS had been effectively penetrated by the Communists during the war, and the FBI claimed that Allen Dulles had hired “a bunch of Bolsheviks” to work with him.86 In point of fact, while the OSS made use of Communists in its work in occupied Europe, its prevailing political ideology was for the most part a vague sort of Eastern Establishment liberalism.

By comparison, the Army intelligence staff was largely conservative in its political and social outlook. The CIA and G-2 also clashed over the proper function of an American intelligence agency. Military intelligence favored infi ltration of “liberation groups” such as the Byelorussians into the Soviet Union, while Hillenkoetter disdained “unconventional warfare.” He did not believe the high risk of exposure justifi ed actively engaging in sabotage and subversive activities or recruiting paramilitary cadres even on a standby basis. He regarded the CIA as a consumer of intelligence rather than a producer, and was content to receive Gehlen’s reports and pass on analyses to the President. Many of the OSS veterans in the CIA argued that 90 percent of all American intelligence needs could be met by a careful examination of open source material, such as newspapers, or by questioning returning visitors to foreign countries, while the remainder could be supplied by a few wellplaced agents. The OSS faction convinced Hillenkoetter that espionage was an industry for craftsmen, requiring a great deal of skill, enormous concentration, and large amounts of money and patience. To support their arguments the OSS veterans maintained that every American intelligence failure in the postwar era could have been prevented by making better use of information already in the fi les. More emphasis should be placed on gathering information about foreign industry, mineral resources, and political patterns to supplement the heavy doses of purely military intelligence. Hillenkoetter was determined that analysis and collection would be the foundations of the CIA’s success, and that the agency should not become involved in schemes to prepare liberation groups for a war that might never come. The military had important allies, however. Many ranking Republicans regarded the Truman administration’s efforts to contain the Soviet Union as ineffectual. Containment of communism was not enough; America should roll back the frontiers of the Soviet empire and liberate the captive nations of Eastern Europe. The “liberationists” included Thomas E. Dewey, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 1948; John Foster Dulles, Dewey’s top foreign policy adviser; Allen Dulles, his brother and an old OSS hand; and Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had headed the U.S. propaganda-espionage effort in Latin America during the war.[5] Within the government, their allies were James V. Forrestal, the fi rst Secretary of Defense, who possessed a fanatical hatred of communism; George F. Kennan, chief of the State Department’s Policy and Planning Staff; and Robert P. Joyce, Kennan’s assistant for Eastern Europe.

Joyce, Kennan’s assistant for Eastern Europe. Alarmed at the prospect of a Communist victory in the Italian parliamentary elections scheduled for April 1948, Forrestal pressed Truman to use the CIA as an active weapon.87 Following considerable debate, the National Security Council ordered Hillenkoetter to instigate covert operations to make certain that the pro-Western Christian Democrats remained in power. Although Hillenkoetter was concerned that such activities were beyond the statutory jurisdiction of the CIA, he ordered the agency’s Offi ce of Special Operations to take a hand in the Italian elections. Backed by $10 million in secret funds, the OSO launched a wellcoordinated propaganda campaign that created fear of a Communist takeover. Politicians were bought and sold with impunity. Tens of thousands of Americans of Italian ancestry were persuaded to appeal directly to friends and relatives at home to cast their votes for parties that would cooperate with the United States. Although the Communists gained many votes, the Christian Democratic majority was suffi cient to keep them out of the government – and the reluctant OSO was credited with the victory. The success of the Italian operation brought demands for similar actions elsewhere. Just before the Italian election a state of near-hysteria was generated in offi cial Washington by a cable from General Clay, which warned of the danger of imminent war with the Soviets.88 In May 1948, George Kennan produced a plan for a permanent State Department agency to do worldwide what the OSO had done in Italy. While the CIA would continue with the routine collection and interpretation of information, this new agency, the Offi ce of Policy Coordination, would engage in a backalley struggle against the Soviet Union. National Security Council Directive 10/2, the OPC‘s charter, gave it the widest possible latitude, which would include the use of clandestine military organizations to overthrow governments regarded as unfriendly to the United States. The OPC was also a bureaucratic anomaly. Its agents overseas wore American military uniforms, but were paid by the CIA. Although its director was to be chosen by the Secretary of State, policy guidance would theoretically be provided by the Secretaries of State and Defense. In practice, however, OPC’s program emanated almost entirely from the State Department’s Policy and Planning Staff, headed by George Kennan.

Policy and Planning was the nucleus of America’s Cold War effort, with liaisons to each component of the intelligence community. One high-ranking offi cial of the Truman administration confi ded that the State Department had been engaged in intelligence operations even before OPC was created. This is not surprising, in view of the backgrounds of the Policy and Planning Staff. Robert Joyce, who became OPC‘s liaison offi cer, was formerly an OSS agent assigned to guerrilla warfare in Yugoslavia. Kennan had worked in the Moscow embassy from 1939 to 1941, where, according to one of his contemporaries, he had become close friends with Gustav Hilger, who had helped negotiate the Hitler-Stalin Pact. When Hilger was fi rst brought to the United States in 1945 for secret interrogation, he met with a warm reception from his friends in the State Department, who were later to become his sponsors. Retired CIA offi cials agree that the State Department alone had initiated OPC‘s “political action” programs, and that the other intelligence services merely provided cover and logistical support. The Director of Central Intelligence was completely bypassed, even though the OPC eventually became a CIA component, after State became uneasy about the risk of exposure. Yet, when the head of the CIA objected to the recklessness of these covert operations, he was ordered to cooperate. The net result of State’s maneuvering was that no one had ultimate authority for riding herd on OPC, and a strong director could do almost anything he wanted.89 Frank Wisner had returned to government service from his Wall Street legal practice only a short time before he was named to head the Offi ce of Policy Coordination. In 1947, Under Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson suggested that Wisner be named Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Countries. It was an intelligence, rather than a diplomatic, assignment, where Wisner had ample opportunity to map out his plans. Everything that he observed convinced him that the United States faced the prospect of a long struggle with the Soviet Union, with the strong possibility of a sudden eruption into open warfare. Wisner set to work reviewing the accumulated fi les of the OSS, now held by the State Department, including the list of Romanian collaborators and fascists that he had compiled while in Bucharest searching for potential sources for destabilization movements behind Soviet lines. His staff came up with a copy of Stanislaw Hrynkievich’s statement to Third Army intelligence in 1945, with its detailed description of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:113:3b42c4a46c5c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4226, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 114, "text": "the Soviet Union, with the strong possibility of a sudden eruption into open warfare.

Soviet lines and were now vulnerable to blackmail by threats to expose their wartime collaboration with the Nazis. They had also proven their willingness in Operation Tobacco to collaborate with the Americans by informing on Communist penetration of the DP camps. The counterintelligence angle would also provide good cover for Wisner’s guerrilla warfare operations, which he wanted to keep hidden from the rest of the American intelligence community. Wisner was going to make General Patton’s dream a reality – continuing the fi ght against communism by recruiting guerrilla bands of former SS men.[6] Although there was some resistance to a suggestion by Allen Dulles that Wisner be named to head OPC – William R. Corson states that military intelligence regarded him as “another Donovan who’ll run away with the ball” – he had strong backing.90 Forrestal supported him, and so did General Edwin L. Sibert – Gehlen’s original sponsor – who was a deputy director of Central Intelligence, as well as General Clay and the Dulles brothers. Each of these men was sympathetic to Wisner’s desire to create a “standby” force to carry out guerrilla warfare in case of a war with the Soviet Union. The underlying goal was to destabilize each of the Eastern European states in an undeclared war. In fact, the State Department had drawn up a plan to overthrow the governments of several Eastern European countries.91 In the early days of OPC, Wisner projected an air of affability and optimism. A man of independent means – he could afford to leave his uncashed salary checks in his offi ce desk for a year – he lived well and entertained lavishly. His critics say that the real source of his income was the million dollars that he and his Albanian fascist friends stole form the Embassy and buried on Wisner’s country farm in Maryland.

And despite his active social life he was a hard worker, sparing neither himself nor his staff. Wisner was obsessed by an anticommunism that he had developed in the Balkans and postwar Germany, and it was the driving force behind the OPC. Of course, there was always the underlying motive or regaining American fi nancial investments in Eastern Europe and Russia. Wisner threw off ideas for rolling back the Soviet empire – some good, others wildly impractical – like a human pinwheel. Wisner established OPC in the temporary buildings near the Lincoln Memorial and the Refl ecting Pool and recruited a staff of what Stewart Alsop called “Bold Easterners” and less-admiring observers described as “Ivy League dilettantes.”93 They included Kermit Roosevelt, Tracy Barnes, Desmond FitzGerald, Richard Bissell, and Cord Meyer, Jr. The OPC, wrote William Colby, who later became Director of Central Intelligence, operated “in the atmosphere of an order of Knights Templar, to save Western freedom from Communist darkness – and from war.”94 [Overlooked at the time was that these particular Knights had once invested in both Hitler and Stalin. The true mission of OPC, once suspects, was to spare themselves and their fi nancial allies from indictment of collaboration with the enemy. As we shall see, Wisner’s real masters were the Dulles brothers, lawyers for the Robber Barons] By the summer of 1948, when Wisner fl ew to Germany, circumstances had combined to permit him to lay the groundwork for a unique intelligence operation. The presidential election was approaching, and Wisner, a dedicated Republican, was looking forward to a Dewey victory over Truman. This would mean that his program for funding underground guerrilla movements would soon be implemented. It also meant that he would no longer have to conceal his plans from the rest of the American intelligence community, which fl oundered about in various stages of disarray. As far as Wisner was concerned, the CIA under Hillenkoetter was “a bunch of old washerwomen exchanging gossip while they rinse through the dirty linen.”95 Wisner explained his plan to re-create the SS underground networks in Eastern Europe, Byelorussia and the Ukraine to General Clay in several lengthy meetings.96 Once these networks were revived, they could be used to cache supplies of arms and equipment for his “Special Forces.” Soon, Wisner believed, the Soviet Union would begin to disintegrate from internal rebellions, rebellions which he intended to assist and, if necessary, instigate. It was only a matter of time before the Western powers became involved in war, and then Wisner’s underground", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:115:477f0bb5cf81", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4228, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "the SS underground networks in Eastern Europe, Byelorussia and the Ukraine to General Clay in several lengthy meetings.96 Once these networks were revived, they could be used to cache supplies of arms and equipment for his “Special Forces.” Soon, Wisner believed, the Soviet Union would begin to disintegrate from internal rebellions, rebellions which he intended to assist and, if necessary, instigate. It was only a matter of time before the Western powers became involved in war, and then Wisner’s underground armies would play a major role in helping to overthrow the Soviet empire. Of course, Wisner added, it would take several years for the plans to come to fruition – probably not until the 1950s – but it was necessary to begin preparation immediately. He knew that many of the people he wished to recruit were still being hunted because of their pro-Nazi activities and they had to be protected. The CIC, at the direction of Congress, was about to launch a major campaign to prevent Nazi war criminals from emigrating to the United States. It was important that the CIC not obstruct Wisner’s training program which, for reasons of secrecy would have to take place mostly in America. With the leading Nazi collaborators in New York, safe from the prying eyes of other intelligence agencies (not to mention Soviet war crimes investigators), Wisner would be free not only to have his Nazi politicians recruit commando units to guide western forces in any future invasion of Russia, but he could also establish entire “governments-in-exile” to assist with the occupation. Although President Truman had never sanctioned this extension of OPC’s charter, Wisner and General Clay were confi dent that Dewey’s election would guarantee their freedom of operation. After all, the Dulles brothers were key fi gures in the Republican election campaign and they were the most ardent supporters of OPC‘s political action program.[7] But until the defeat of Truman, it was essential that the Byelorussian Nazis and the other collaborators hiding in Clay’s refugee camps remain protected. New EEI’s (Expected Elements of Information) were drawn up by Clay’s intelligence staff and forwarded to the fi eld. [EEI’s were the Headquarters’ blueprint for espionage priorities] The EEI’s for Byelorussia and the Ukraine were so sensitive that they were not published even in the Top Secret CIC Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual, but were issued directly to the commanders in a special memorandum. The effect was immediately apparent. A special team of CIC agents had been working in West Germany to confi rm Hitler’s death by interviewing his bodyguards and chauffeurs, many of whom had gone underground in the Displaced Persons camps. When the CIC team went into the Byelorussian camps to round them up for questioning, however, they were quickly ordered to withdraw and were told that the persons they were seeking would not be found there.

When the CIC team went into the Byelorussian camps to round them up for questioning, however, they were quickly ordered to withdraw and were told that the persons they were seeking would not be found there. Instead, the CIC was ordered quietly to collect all intelligence on the political activities of the Byelorussian refugees and their links with other intelligence agencies. No mention was made of prosecuting the ex-Nazis, only of observing them. [A similar “do not arrest” order was issued for the Ukrainian Nazis, as we shall see.] Apparently the CIC‘s analysts were disgruntled by the hands-off treatment given the Byelorussians. In their Top Secret Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual for 1948, they devoted a special chapter to the Byelorussian Nazi underground that was encyclopedic in its thoroughness. More than a hundred Byelorussian leaders were identifi ed by their wartime services to the Nazis, present status in the DP camps, and relationship to the various Byelorussian factions. Virtually the entire Nazi puppet government was identifi ed, and the CIC made it clear that every one of the factions had collaborated with the Nazis. Their claims to be leaders of a legitimate nationalist political movement were plainly without foundation, for, as the Manual pointed out: To ease occupational problems and to take advantage of native nationalist feeling, the Germans created the puppet state of White Russia during their invasion…. When the Red Army threatened to reoccupy the country in 1944, the puppet government moved to Berlin and continued its activity as a government in exile. The Germans, in the meantime, put their agents into the Central Rada [Council]. Nevertheless, Wisner’s plans for a “standby” guerrilla movement were proceeding smoothly. General Clay, the most powerful American in Europe, was on his side, and he had neutralized the troublesome CIC by making it a part of the program. Now Wisner began recruitment of his OPC paramilitary force. The old SSU had already established intelligence operations in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Ukraine, and had even made brief contact with the Byelorussians. Wisner’s program was more comprehensive, and less susceptible to exposure by the CIA, which was at that time actively assisting with the prosecution of war criminals at Nuremberg. Wisner’s staff contacted each of the German intelligence chiefs who had worked with the émigrés during the war. It was not hard to fi nd them: Hilger had given his State Department friends a great deal of information, and most of the key Nazis were already working for the Americans at Gehlen’s secret base in Pullach, where Wisner now went to visit him.

This elaborate new headquarters, built in 1938 as a large housing development for SS offi cers and their families, had been converted into a sort of fortress at a cost to the United States of $3 million. The Gehlen Organization left Oberursel near Frankfurt and moved into Pullach in the second week of December 1947, prepared to continue its espionage activities against the Soviet Union, now backed by substantial American fi nancial aid.[8] [2] Although the American military government tried to crack down on the black market, military intelligence also subsidized it by paying its informants in cigarettes and other hard-to-get goods. Gehlen augmented his cash subsidies from the Americans by taking payment for his own network of informants in cigarettes and cocoa, which he sold on the black market. There was a rumor that the Americans had given him the Lucky Strike cigarette concession as a permanent subsidy for his organization, but it does not appear true. The CIC was unhappy with Gehlen’s prowess, however. Not only did he make their own efforts seem ineffective, but to their credit, CIC offi cers deduced that much of Gehlen’s information could have been planted by the MVD, the latest version of the Soviet state security apparatus. The CIC had secretly photocopied the entire secret archives of the communist membership of East Germany, and knew that many of Gehlen’s informants were selling information to both sides. Many years later, Gehlen’s right hand man, Heinz Felfe, who was in charge of anti-Soviet intelligence, turned out to be a Soviet spy. All of Gehlen’s amazing information about Soviet strengths, weaknesses and war plans turned out to be a fi ction made up in Moscow. [5] During the war, Rockefeller foreshadowed the anticommunist policies of the Cold War by cozying up to dictatorial regimes in Latin America. Niccolo Tucci, head of the State Department’s Bureau of Latin American Research, resigned because of this, asking Secretary of State Cordell Hull to abolish his bureau. “My bureau was supposed to undo the Nazi and fascist propaganda in South America and Rockefeller was inviting the worst fascists and Nazis to Washington.” Tucci took his objections to Rockefeller and was told: “ ‘Everybody is useful and we’re going to convert these people to friendliness to the United States.’ And then, Rockefeller’s lawyer Larry Levy said to me, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll buy those people’ ” (Peter Collier and David Horowitz, The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty.

[6] Recently, Marc Truitt, a graduate student working on his doctoral dissertation in Albanian history, came across references to State’s Top Secret plans for the overthrow of the Communist regime in that country. The documents that he discovered at the National Archives plainly establish the role of the Policy and Planning Staff in recruiting a network of Albanian anti-communists, principally from among those who had previously been denied visas as Nazi collaborators and war criminals. In 1948, Robert Joyce arranged for one such person to be brought to the United States “outside of the regular visa division” channels. In arranging this patently illegal transaction, Joyce laconically explained that “our friends” had determined that the person was of interest to the national security. From subsequent documents, the identity of the Nazi’s friends became clear. He and his fellow collaborators were later placed in charge of an OPC front group in New York, and began recruiting agents for OPC‘s abortive invasion of Albania. [7] One retired CIA offi cial said that the Dulles brothers were “fanatical” adherents of covert liberation programs. Another, who visited with John Foster Dulles during the Dewey campaign, described the OPC Cold War mentality as almost “surrealistic,” and inexplicable outside of the context of the times. Gehlen must have envied Wisner. The Offi ce of Policy Coordination had access to unlimited funds, and the entire world was its area of operations.[1] Sensing that OPC was the wave of the future, he became Wisner’s fi rm ally. Wisner offered fi nancial support, which Gehlen repaid with information – particularly about the Byelorussian DPs, who so much interested the American. They conferred together on several occasions during the Cold War. The two men presented a striking contrast: Wisner, bulky and given to orotund utterance; Gehlen, short, slight, and precise as he provided a briefi ng that fi lled the gaps in Wisner’s knowledge about the intended recruits for his secret army. For example, the CIC, despite its extensive digging into the background of the Byelorussians, realized only that Franz Kushel, who had taken over control of the Michelsdorf DP camp, was a Nazi police commander who had served with the Waffen-SS. They did not know that Kushel’s camp was the home of the Belarus Brigade, which had fought against the Americans on the western front.

They did not know that Kushel’s camp was the home of the Belarus Brigade, which had fought against the Americans on the western front. Gehlen was aware of the facts because his organization employed many of the SS and SD men who had supervised the Byelorussians during the war. The leaders of the SS intelligence network in Byelorussia were now “research analysts” in Pullach, and over the next four years Gehlen recruited most of the original intelligence staff of the Byelorussian Einsatzgruppen. Gehlen believed that the émigrés who had most recently collaborated with the Germans were the ones in closest touch with the thinking of the populations behind the Iron Curtain.[2] For this reason he had immediately recruited Ostrowsky and his followers after they had been dropped by the British in favor of Abramtchik‘s group. He urged Wisner to put his political backing and fi nancial support behind Ostrowsky, and suggested that they try to bring about a merger of various factions. Ostrowsky had taken such a step early in May 1948 by convening a mass meeting of Byelorussian refugees at the Ellwangen DP camp. Abramtchik did his best to disrupt planning for the session, and his people were ordered to boycott it. When he learned that Ostrowsky had petitioned General Clay to be accredited as head of a legitimate government-in-exile,98 Abramtchik launched a fresh campaign to discredit the Ostrowsky group as war criminals – even though Stankievich and Kushel were leading fi gures in his own organization. The charges and countercharges of Communist infi ltration and Nazi collaboration were so strident that they reached the Byelorussian-language press. Fortunately for both factions, few outsiders were able to read the camp newspapers. The infi ghting gradually subsided, but not before Abramtchik’s divisive tactics caused lingering resentment in both groups.99 To eliminate the endless feuding, Wisner and Gehlen planned to establish an umbrella group – known as the KTsAB for its Russian acronym – to lead the various nationalities in the struggle to liberate the homelands. The Byelorussians were to be used as a link to the other British groups, especially the more numerous Ukrainians. The Americans planned eventually to supplant the British and take control of all émigré anticommunist activities. Kennan’s Policy and Planning Staff had already convinced the State Department to fund a series of innocuous-sounding cover organizations in New York,[ such as the American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism or AMCOMLIB.

AMCOMLIB, later known as Radio Liberty, was funded by the innocent sounding Crusade for Freedom, for whom young Ronald Reagan was the pitchman in fundraising commercials. Reagan well knew that 99% of AMCOMLIB’s funding came not from his fundraising commercials but from CIA’s unvouchered funds. This information was censored from the original manuscript of this book.] With the help of the old OSS political intelligence fi les, Joyce arranged to have these organizations staffed with the “émigré leaders” that Wisner would select. In turn, they could fund each of the KTsAB’s émigré committees headquartered in Paris, Munich, London, and Rome.[3] Under the guise of carrying on anticommunist propaganda, the émigré committees would also identify potential recruits for the paramilitary section of OPC. Wisner’s immediate strategy was to locate enough Nazi intelligence offi cers to train the nucleus of the private armies that were to fi ght in the expected guerrilla war behind the Iron Curtain. Gehlen was to identify those to be recruited, and General Clay would provide cover for the training activities at the European Command Intelligence School near Oberammergau in Bavaria, or at OPC’s “Air Force” units near Wiesbaden. Money for the project would be drawn from untraceable government accounts, such as those of the CIA, and laundered through American corporations whose leaders had expressed willingness to work with Wisner and OPC. Gehlen suggested that Wisner hire Dr. Franz Six to head the recruitment and training of the Special Forces. Dr. Six knew most of the leading Byelorussians, he explained, having recruited them for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia. Six, however, was at that moment on trial at Nuremberg for his war crimes. Wisner asked General Clay to intercede with the Nuremberg prosecutor and judges. Whether Clay took such action is unknown, but Six received only a twenty-year prison term, while the rest of the Einsatzgruppen commanders were sentenced to death. In 1950, Clay’s successor, High Commissioner John J. McCloy, commuted the sentence to time served, and Six went to work for Gehlen on the Special Forces project. Wisner and Gehlen found the DP camps fertile ground for recruits. Hundreds of thousands of young refugees – Byelorussians, Poles, Balts, Ukrainians, and anti-Stalinist Russians – lacked work or prospects of emigration. The only jobs they could fi nd were as ill-paid farm workers or as laborers clearing bomb rubble.

The “secret army” provided good pay and living conditions, and within a few months recruits were assembled at various camps. American and former Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS instructors provided training in hand-to-hand combat, wireless operation, parachuting, small arms, demolition, signals, and all the other “trade craft” of the spy. In the early 1950s, several of these agents were parachuted into various regions of the Soviet Union from planes supplied by Wisner. They had excellently forged documents and carried miniature radio transmitters, as well as a few thousand rubles and small bags of gold coins with which to buy favors from peasants whom they might have to ask for food and shelter. Some of these agents were to attempt to make contact with the agents Gehlen had left behind in Russia after the German retreat; others were to take jobs in Soviet industry and report back on what they found. A few were successful and provided information for a brief time, but most were quickly captured and executed. Some were “turned” by the Soviets and transmitted false information to Gehlen until the Russians decided to make a show of them at well-publicized press conferences.100 Many of the recruits from the Byelorussian SS were put on the government payroll as members of “Polish” labor service battalions and detailed as armed guards at American PXs and commissaries. $\\underline { { 1 0 1 } }$ The Byelorussian units kept the same command structure used under the Nazis and simply changed uniforms as they went on the American payroll. Some had “Polish army” papers signed by Joseph Danikevich, who had been an offi cer in one of the Byelorussian police units absorbed into the Belarus Brigade. One of the benefi ts of joining a labor service unit was the fact that character references were provided. For example, a document in Stankievich’s fi le from the commanding offi cer of the U.S. Army’s 59th Supervision Company stated that, “in the opinion of the undersigned, Stankievich, Stanislaw, is a good prospect for providing the United States with a loyal, useful citizen of excellent integrity.” The other intelligence agencies were not oblivious to the preparations taking place in Germany, although Wisner did his best to keep the CIC and the CIA away from his operation.102 His cover was that he was planning to train psychological-warfare operators and secret agents who would help downed American fl iers escape from behind the Iron Curtain in case of war.

Most of the American agencies were content to believe that this was all Wisner intended with his rather small operations in West Germany. The MVD was not fooled, however. Soviet intelligence had penetrated every corner of the Byelorussian network and had even entered into active competition with Gehlen and Wisner for recruits in the DP camps. Anticipating that the western Allies would sooner or later try to establish an anti-Soviet underground movement, the Russians engaged in a preemptive strike. The right wing exile groups – Byelorussian BCC, Ukrainian OUN, and Russian NTS – were all riddled with Soviet agents. From almost the beginning, as we have seen, Ostrowsky had repeatedly charged that many of Abramtchik’s associates were former Communists and his group had been honeycombed with Soviet informers. Wisner went to the best source for comment on these charges – Kim Philby, who had been head of anti-Soviet operations for the British secret service at the time the British recruited Abramtchik and his followers. Philby, then in Washington as liaison between the British and the CIA and FBI, assured Wisner that Ostrowsky’s warnings were merely the sour grapes of a disaffected politician. In later years, however, Ostrowsky’s warning of Communist penetration of the Abramtchik faction received independent corroboration. CIC records show that several Soviet moles were unearthed who furnished derogatory information about the group. Other intelligence agencies learned that one of Abramtchik’s deputies had been trained as an intelligence offi cer by the Soviets. (He later emigrated to the United States.) Military intelligence identifi ed several Byelorussians as part of a network that passed sensitive information to east-bloc intelligence services. (Another of these alleged Communist agents subsequently worked in America.) [Soviet Intelligence had found a shortcut for smuggling their agents to America … their spies just “confessed” that they were former Nazis willing to fi ght communism.] Stanislaw Stankievich was pressured by Soviet intelligence to work for them, but he reported the recruiter to the CIC. She was Nina Litwinczyk, the typist at Gestapo headquarters in Minsk during the German occupation who had supplied the Soviets with the names of Nazi collaborators. Since 1945 she had been blackmailing these fugitives in an effort to turn them into Russian agents.103 Years later, the FBI received three separate reports concerning a Communist agent living in the United States.

One of the prisoners confessed to the pro-Russian partisans that he was a secret communist agent who had infi ltrated the Nazi networks. The other two bona fi de Nazi collaborators managed to escape from the partisans and, following the war, eventually made their way to the United States, only to fi nd that the self-confessed communist spy had preceded them.104 The FBI fi led the reports without action because the Time after time, American intelligence offi cials ignored their own informants or were persuaded by Kim Philby that the charges about Communist agents among the Byelorussians were merely mudslinging by the out-of-favor Ostrowsky faction. Philby’s biggest coup was to unload the Communist-infi ltrated Abramtchik organization on the all-too-eager Wisner.105 Pleading a lack of funding from Britain’s impecunious postwar government, he allowed Wisner to take over the group, emphasizing the extensive espionage network that Abramtchik was supposedly developing in Poland. Philby also threw in the entire NTS network to serve as the foundation for a Pan-Slavic anticommunist bloc in exchange for access to the intelligence produced. Delighted by Philby’s willingness to cooperate with the OPC, Wisner accepted the offer. As chief of the Soviet section of British intelligence, Philby could claim his successes – in which he was assisted by his Soviet masters – and was considered a preeminent authority on anti-Soviet espionage. Wisner apparently believed that Philby’s endorsement provided the “Special Forces” concept with a cachet that might have taken him years to acquire on his own. The sardonic Philby must have smiled to himself as he turned over the hollow shells of his Eastern European intelligence operations to Wisner. In his memoirs, published after he escaped to the Soviet Union, Philby dismissed Wisner as “a young man for so responsible a job, balding and running self-importantly to fat.”106 Wisner wanted to train his Nazi protégés in the United States out of sight of both Soviet spies and other Allied intelligence agencies. Plans were made to bring recruits to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for parachute instruction, and a secret base was established near Williamsburg, Virginia where they could be trained in guerrilla warfare without even knowing they were in the United States. In order for this to happen, however, Wisner had to evade a ban imposed by President Truman on admitting ex-Nazis to this country without alerting the Immigration Service.

German rocket and atomic scientists. To make such recruitment easier, the Russians had classifi ed virtually every signifi cant German physicist as a “war criminal” subject to immediate arrest. [Some scientists, such as Arthur Rudolph, were in fact war criminals who used Jewish slave laborers as if they were disposable chemicals at his underground Dora facility for V-2 rockets. Years later, Rudolph admitted his crimes to OSI, and accepted voluntary deportation back to Germany.] The Pentagon asked Truman for permission to “deny” these scientists to the Russians by smuggling them into the United States. The White House was concerned that the United States might be accused of breaching international agreements against sheltering war criminals, and issued an order forbidding admission into the country of any scientist who had voluntarily aided the Nazis. The scientists brought over in Operation Paperclip, therefore, were to be classifi ed as prisoners of war so as not to violate immigration laws. Top Secret White House documents recently discovered among State Department archives conclusively establish that Truman was under the impression that no American agency had ever brought any Nazi “quislings, traitors, or war criminals” into the country.[5] Assistance in earmarking which German scientists to recruit was offered by Donald Maclean, the First Secretary of the British embassy in Washington and liaison for atomic secrets.107 Maclean was also a Soviet mole. Among the Top Secret documents in the Operation Paperclip fi les is a letter from him advising the Pentagon that certain German scientists were not important enough for recruitment. Later it was determined that several of these men were physicists of international reputation. And the Pentagon soon began to notice that with unsettling regularity many of the scientists whom it wanted to bring to the United States were disappearing, apparently kidnapped by the Russians. The Pentagon had other worries. The CIC, which had been assigned to scrutinize the candidates for entry into the United States to ferret out Nazis, was coming dangerously close to discovering that several Paperclip candidates were war criminals who had participated in experiments on human beings or had employed slave labor under inhuman conditions. [Indeed, I discovered in the Top Secret vaults written orders from President Truman banning the immigration of any German Scientist who was either a) an early member of the Nazi party b) an SS volunteer or c) wanted by the Allied for war crimes.

The State Department, convinced that President Dewey would soon take offi ce, simply lied to the President, sanitized the scientists’ fi les, and brought them to America anyway.] The Pentagon had apparently decided, without informing the President, that the interests of national security in using these scientists far outweighed any notion of prosecuting them for war crimes. The names of several scientists were deleted from the Army’s war crimes suspects list, and the CIC was directed to accelerate background clearances for them. The war crimes investigations were closed, and a “no derogatory information” report was issued. The scientists were simply listed as cargo on an aircraft weigh bill and fl own to the United States. Several years later they would be paraded across the Mexican border and back again so as to create a “legal” entry for immigration.108 It was almost an article of faith that any deception was permissible to protect valuable scientists such as Wernher von Braun from Soviet apprehension.[6] There were, however, several incidents that graphically illustrated the haphazard nature of postwar security checks for German scientists. According to one CIA agent, Klaus Fuchs was given clearance to work on the atomic bomb project despite the fact that the agency possessed a classifi ed SS report identifying him as a Communist spy. The document was discovered only after Fuchs had sent much important information off to Moscow. (I have since found this document in the National Archives.) The net result of OPC’s recruitment of Nazi scientists was that the Russians obtained all the secrets of the US Atom Bomb research. With the “successful” Paperclip example before him, Frank Wisner designed a program to smuggle his “freedom fi ghters” into the United States, where he could prepare them for the coming war of liberation. He instructed OPC to concentrate on refugees who had been high-level political collaborators. They were to be brought to the United States to set up “national committees for liberation” for each country behind the Iron Curtain, with money funneled through the OPC‘s secret accounts. Clay’s contacts ensured that the CIC would not conduct war crimes investigations involving them, while Wisner used his infl uence within the State Department to make certain that the Nazis’ visa applications were expedited.109 It was not a large operation at fi rst.

Between 1948 and 1950, while the CIA was still being organized, the State Department systematically imported and recruited the leaders of nearly all the puppet regimes established by the Third Reich from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Hilger’s dream was coming true. *George Kennan, who designed the administrative structure of OPC for the State Department, was also instrumental in forming the National Committee for a Free Europe. However, there is no conclusive evidence that he knew that Joyce and Wisner were staffi ng these committees with former Nazi collaborators.[ Such ignorance does seem implausible, given Kennan’s rank and position.] The OPC insiders were hardly ignorant of the fact that these men were responsible for war crimes involving thousands of innocent civilians. Joyce himself had fought the Nazi collaborators in Yugoslavia. Wisner had been stationed with the OSS in Istanbul during the war when refugees escaping from Eastern Europe described the role of these political leaders in the Holocaust. Kennan, the State Department’s Russian expert, must have had access to the reports of atrocities in Byelorussia and the Ukraine from the OSS, the Polish Secret Service, and the U.S. Military Attache in Moscow. The Department even maintained a Political Biographical Section that cross-fi led all the reports on the emigre leaders. In the Library of Congress is a 1948 publication by the government of Albania, identifying its major collaborators and war criminals. Across the top is the signature of the State Department offi cial who donated the copy. A few months later, many of the war criminals listed were placed in charge of the “National Committee for a Free Albania” by the State Department. A review of State cable traffi c in the National Archives, Diplomatic Branch, Decimal Files Section, shows that they possessed similar information on the backgrounds of the collaborators in each country prior to OPC’s recruiting drive in 1948-50. Kennan’s friend in the German Foreign Offi ce, Gustav Hilger, can hardly deny that he knew of the atrocities. Foreign Offi ce records in the National Archives show that weekly reports from the Einsatzgruppen were forwarded to Hilger’s Russian desk.

Several of the persons named in the CIA report, including various Ukrainian collaborators [such as Mykola Lebed], were recruited by OPC. In a secret report, an Army intelligence offi cer noted with amusement that one wing of the CIA (apparently OSO) was hunting Ukrainian Nazis, while another wing (OPC) was recruiting them. All of the intelligence offi cers with whom I spoke placed full responsibility for the initial recruitment of collaborators on the State Department. [1]As early as 1949 the OPC had 302 agents in fi ve stations and a budget of $4.7 million. By 1952, the number of employees had jumped to about 4,000 in forty-seven stations and the budget had reached 582 million. This did not include funds spent by other American intelligence agencies on behalf of OPC, nor did it represent the expenses of OPC proprietary operations such as Radio Liberty. [3] During a series of interviews, former CIA offi cials conceded that nearly every American intelligence organization, including OPC, had utilized ex-Nazi émigrés for intelligence purposes in Europe during the Cold War. To do otherwise, they insisted, would have been negligent, since there were so few sources of information available with any expertise on Eastern Europe. All of them disavowed any knowledge that the Nazi émigrés were later assisted in entering the United States. Several conceded that in view of the bitter rivalry between CIA and OPC in the late forties, it would have been most unlikely that Wisner would have apprised them of his plans. [One Army offi cer when shown evidence that his former Nazi agents had been relocated to America said “this is treason.”] [6] Ψ^(*)Not all the scientists, of course, were von Brauns. Some were Soviet spies. Not until many years later, when one of the Paperclip scientists turned down a job requiring a Top Secret clearance, did the Army fi rst begin to suspect that it may have been too hasty in expediting the earlier background checks. The “scientist” confessed that he had simply made up a host of academic credentials in the hope that the Americans would grant him sanctuary.

The “scientist” feared that if he accepted the better-paying job offer and underwent a Top Secret clearance investigation his fraud might be discovered. To the consternation of the Army investigator conducting the interview, the man also confessed that before his departure to the United States he had been solicited to become an informant for Soviet intelligence. For years the “scientist” had lived in dread that one day the Soviet agents would blackmail him. After an investigation the Army decided that he was telling the truth and had not been in contact with the Soviets since coming to America. Apparently the Soviets had much higher level Nazi scientists on their payroll. Paradoxically, at the same time that Wisner was trying to smuggle Byelorussian and Ukrainian Nazis into the United States, these very same people were being denounced in Congress as examples of those who should not be allowed entry. In the summer of 1948, Congress approved the Displaced Persons Act, which permitted some 400,000 refugees to come to America, but only after extensive debate because of widespread concern that war criminals might slip through the screening process. The strict standards established by the International Refugee Organization (IRO) to bar war criminals, Nazi offi cials, and collaborators from emigrating were tightened by Congress. Even mere membership in any “movement hostile” to the United States was made suffi cient cause for denial of an immigration visa. On August 7, 1948, during the debate on the DP bill, Congressman Arthur G. Klein of New York cited Stanislaw Stankievich as an example of the war criminals hiding in the refugee camps who should never be permitted to enter the United States. Klein inserted into the Congressional Record Appendix an article prepared by an OSS offi cer who was then assisting the Nuremberg prosecution, giving a detailed account of the Borissow massacre and other atrocities in Byelorussia and the Ukraine. The documentation included Sergeant Soennecken’s report on the events of October 19-20,1941, which had been entered as evidence at Nuremberg.110 For the fi rst time Congress learned of the holocaust in Byelorussia, as Klein read Soennecken’s account of the slaughter of the 7,000 Jews of Borissow. He also noted the OSS agent’s belief that among the refugees in the European camps were many Eastern European Nazis, including Stankievich, who were trying to emigrate to America: Ukrainians, and White Russians. [Nuremberg] Document E.C. 326, a memorandum [dated] November 26, 1942, on the treatment of Poles, instructed the Nazi administrators in Poland to take care that “in particular, mayors, district and region chiefs of Polish nationality", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:129:79c7549b972c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4242, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "read Soennecken’s account of the slaughter of the 7,000 Jews of Borissow.

[Nuremberg] Document E.C. 326, a memorandum [dated] November 26, 1942, on the treatment of Poles, instructed the Nazi administrators in Poland to take care that “in particular, mayors, district and region chiefs of Polish nationality or pro-Polish leaders of large industrial plants and estates will be dismissed and replaced by members of other nationalities (Lithuanians, White Russians, Ukrainians)…. The Polish language … must neither be put on the same level nor be preferred to the use of Lithuanian, White Ruthenian, or Ukrainian. To buttress his contention that large numbers of SS men who persecuted the Poles and Jews were also hiding in the DP camps, Klein produced additional comments from the OSS expert. He described how the Nuremberg documents clearly showed that many non-German collaborators had served the SS in Byelorussia, the Ukraine, and the Baltic states: The Baltic and Ukrainian collaborationists proved so loyal to their Nazi masters that the latter incorporated them in the elite corps, in the SS. For a non-German to qualify for membership in the SS, he would need to have proved his total loyalty to Himmler, in short, to be a superkiller. As an isolated report (1137-PS, October 19, 1944) indicates, the Nazis were few, widely distributed, stationed almost entirely in the towns and lost in the maze of villages. To carry out the confi scations, requisitions, recruitment for forced labor, the Nazis used a large force of collaborationists, made up of local residents, without whom these tasks could not have been carried out. Alerted by such testimony, Congress intended to make certain that Stankievich and others responsible for equally horrifying atrocities would never be permitted to enter the United States. Even persons who had merely been members of collaborationist movements were to be barred. A three-tier system of review was established. First, the IRO had to certify that a visa applicant was eligible, under its standard, as a victim of Nazi oppression. Then the CIC would investigate to determine whether the applicant had ever been a member of a “movement hostile” to the United States. After CIC clearance, a U.S. Displaced Persons Commission created by the law would require an American organization to sponsor and certify that the applicant was of good moral character and had a job waiting for him in the United States.111 Only then could the State Department issue an immigration visa. As soon as the Displaced Persons Act became law, American religious and charitable organizations went to the DP camps of occupied Germany to sponsor refugees for immigration. Among the camp leaders who played a key role in selecting “worthy” candidates for emigration were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:130:da0f156692d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4243, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "require an American organization to sponsor and certify that the applicant was of good moral character and had a job waiting for him in the United States.111 Only then could the State Department issue an immigration visa. As soon as the Displaced Persons Act became law, American religious and charitable organizations went to the DP camps of occupied Germany to sponsor refugees for immigration. Among the camp leaders who played a key role in selecting “worthy” candidates for emigration were Franz Kushel of the Belarus Brigade and Stanislaw Stankievich of Borissow. The CIC was proud of its role in helping to assure that Nazis were barred from entering the United States. As early as 1945 the agency had assigned a special denazifi cation section to each major district in the American zone in Germany to apprehend Nazi war criminals and prosecute them before special tribunals that supplemented the Nuremberg trials. The CIC‘s record of prosecutions was an admirable one, and, on the whole, it carried out the will of Congress with integrity and effi ciency. To be sure, the CIC recruited its share of Nazis to help track down other Nazis, but for the most part these informants were rewarded only with cigarettes or scarce rations. Only a handful of extremely valuable agents were helped to emigrate, and they were sent to the United Kingdom rather than the United States. [For example, Juri Soloviev-Sawadsky told CIC that he was a communist spy posing as a Nazi collaborator. As a reward for identifying other “red Nazi” double agents in the Belarus Brigade, Army intelligence asked Australian intelligence to resettle Sawadsky “down under.” Australian intelligence then lied to the Australian Parliamentary inquiry about his background. Unfortunately, a few zealots in the CIC knowingly permitted Nazi informants to process through for immigration to the United States. Such instances were rare, however, and must be considered in the context of the hundreds of thousands of German denazifi cation and refugee investigation cases that the CIC conducted. [In addition to bringing a few thousand Nazis to America, one offi cer admitted that OPC had sent so many Nazis to Chile and Argentina, that one day they passed the word that they just refused to take anymore. My counterpart in the West German prosecutors offi ce, the BundesJustizMinisterium, estimated that 150,000 Nazis committed war crimes during WWII, of whom less than 50,000 received even minimal punishment, Most fugitive Nazi war criminals remain in Germany to this day, while signifi cant numbers were resettled by the British—and only later by the Americans – in Australia, Argentina and Canada. The latter probably has the highest per capita Nazi population outside of Germany. Only a few thousand at most, including approximately 300 members of the Belarus Brigade ever reached America.] This is not to say that the Pentagon was totally precluded from employing Nazis as intelligence agents, especially in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:131:f1f32b2a4dc2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4244, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "Most fugitive Nazi war criminals remain in Germany to this day, while signifi cant numbers were resettled by the British—and only later by the Americans – in Australia, Argentina and Canada.

In fact, the opposite seems to have been true. One offi cial admitted putting his own fi ngerprints on documents belonging to a former SS offi cer who was spying for the military in East Germany. Equipped with a new set of documents and a safe set of prints, the SS man was free to emigrate wherever he chose. Although it was a violation of the Treaty of Montevideo to assist Nazis to fi nd shelter in the Western Hemisphere, the Pentagon, at least where its own interests were concerned, was willing to ignore any Nazi migration to South America. The Soviets got wind of the exodus, and Pravda charged that thousands of Soviet nationals in the American and British zones of occupation were being sent to South America by way of Trieste. [One minor Vatican offi cial wrote that his offi ce had helped resettle 20,000 fugitive German soldiers and technicians to South America.] [The reason why so relatively few Nazis made it to America is enshrined in the separation of powers doctrine in the U.S. Constitution. Only Congress has the power to determine the qualifi cations for American residency or citizenship.] It was quite clear that anyone wishing to bring Nazis into the United States would have to do so over the express prohibitions of Congress, in violation of several criminal laws, and against the direct orders of the Commander-in-Chief. Congress and the President were not blind to the needs of national security, however, and exceptions were made. In 1949 a special law was enacted to permit the CIA to bring in not more than a hundred persons a year who were “ineligible” for visas to the United States. As in the case of Mykola Lebed, head of the Ukrainian Gestapo-like SB, Justice and State concealed that he was a wanted war Nazi criminal, and listed his involvement with a pre-war Polish assassination plot as the only grounds for his ineligibility to obtain a regular visa. For the most part the CIA acted in an exemplary fashion under the “Hundred Persons Act.”[1] The Pentagon had a similar mechanism for special entry where intelligence considerations were involved. The State Department had no legal authority to waive immigration provisions for OPC recruits.

The State Department had no legal authority to waive immigration provisions for OPC recruits. The power to suspend entry requirements temporarily did not even exist until 1951, and even then Congress insisted, as it had in the “Hundred Persons Act,” that entry would be permitted only for a brief visit for reasons of national security.112 Even then, some congressmen argued that the waiver law and the “Hundred Persons Act” could never be used to provide a mechanism for Nazis and fascists to enter the United States. [In the Top Secret Bloodstone Files of the National Security Council are the records of a meeting Wisner had with the Justice Department. Both were concerned about what would happen if Congress ever learned about “the few bad apples” that were being brought to America. The Deputy Attorney General explained to Wisner that there was no legal way Justice could accomplish this, so the best approach would be to shift the blame to the Army, which was much more likely to escape Congressional wrath. Wisner concurred. ] Wisner’s plans to build an anticommunist liberation movement required that large numbers of “freedom fi ghters” be brought to America, but it was too substantial an operation to escape CIC scrutiny. Inasmuch as Attorney General Tom C. Clark was helping prepare the Nuremberg war crimes prosecutions, Wisner knew not to push his friends at Justice while Truman was still President. As the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Countries, Wisner had already placed his own agents in key State Department visa offi ces, and his involvement in Operation Paperclip helped him learn how to circumvent the CIC‘s screening process. In recruiting the German scientists, the Pentagon’s Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency reported to the State-Navy-War Coordinating Committee, a predecessor of the National Security Council. In the State Department’s 1947 telephone directory, the room assigned to the SNWCC liaison at State was also the offi ce of Frank Wisner, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Countries. According to State Department Security offi cials, this offi ce had almost unlimited access to the visa channels of persons wishing to emigrate to America from occupied Germany. There was a weak point in the CIC‘s system. All of its information on Nazi war criminals was stored in one consolidated CIC fi le in West Germany. During the period in which the DPs came to the United States the fi le was located fi rst at Frankfurt and then Stuttgart, before being moved to its current home at the United States Army Investigative Records Repository (USAIRR) at Fort Meade, Maryland.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:133:297559d55e77", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4246, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "wishing to emigrate to America from occupied Germany.

The CIC gathered information from every conceivable source: agents in the DP camps, Nazi personnel records, and from other intelligence services, most of which maintained liaison offi cers at the Stuttgart central fi les. For reasons of national security, the author has been requested to delete certain details of the fi le-laundering process and to state only that “various intelligence agencies had access to the central fi les at the Stuttgart CIC. [Now that the security restrictions have been lifted, I can confi rm that OPC’s Boris Pash had a fi le clerk inside CIC who worked for him. Ostensibly an Army offi cer, Pash was identifi ed during the Church Committee hearings as being in charge of OPC Program Branch 7, responsible for assassinations. Similarly, access to the CIC central index was granted to a liaison from the British Army of the Rhine. The BAOR liaison later confessed to being a communist double agent. Two of the American political commanders (OMGUS) worked for OPC, as did the French OMGUS liaison, Jean Francois Poncet. Francois Poncet had been a Nazi informant for Klaus Barbie of the Gestapo during the war, and then worked for OPC’s predecessor WDD, after the war. WDD was the code name for Allen Dulles’ secret unit.] It is not surprising, then that in 1985 the Justice Department falsely put the blame on the Army for the Klaus Barbie case, and pretended not to know what the “WDD” was that Barbie worked for. The CIC never knew that there were OPC “ringers” combing through their central fi les. It is not surprising therefore, that not all the information in the CIC’s fi les was released to CIC agents, several of whom were Jews who scrupulously obeyed the edict against Nazi immigration. Each of the other American intelligence agencies devoted a great deal of effort to spying on CIC, and jealously guarded the Nazis in its employ. If a CIC fi eld agent in Frankfurt conducted a visa check on a Nazi who was secretly working for Military Intelligence in Munich, the MIS liaison to the CIC Central Records Repository would simply “red-fl ag” his agent’s records so that any queries would come to him. Consequently, no information would be released.

Consequently, no information would be released. CIC Stuttgart would then report to the fi eld agent that the central fi les contained “no derogatory information” and the MIS agent would be allowed to emigrate, in spite of his Nazi background. Under General Clay’s direction, the MIS had used this system to sanitize incriminating information in the CIC fi les about the German scientists brought to the United States by Operation Paperclip. Wisner approached Clay and received similar access for his “Special Forces” staff. This fi le-laundering system worked well, and derogatory information was withheld from the CIC fi eld investigators checking on visa applicants. For example, the CIC had a thick dossier on Stanislaw Hrynkievich which listed the fact that he had been arrested in 1945 as a security suspect, had confessed during imprisonment to being a Nazi collaborator, and had also admitted being vice president of the White Ruthenian “self-help” committee in Berlin, which was enough by itself to place him in the CIC‘s “automatic arrest” category. Moreover, he had been a ranking member of the central committee of the Byelorussian government, which made him both a “quisling” and a member of a “movement hostile.” Placed on top of all these incriminating documents is a letter from the Central Repository to the CIC visa investigator stating that its records showed that Hrynkievich was a medical-school student in Berlin who was staunchly anticommunist. This was the only information furnished to the DP Commission,[2] and Hrynkievich was permitted to go to the United States despite his having been imprisoned by the Americans for his Nazi activities, and despite his denial of this fact on his visa form.113 After the CIC check was evaded, the rest was easy. Few immigration offi cials had even heard of Byelorussia. Since the Soviets did not furnish information to the IRO, it was barely mentioned in the agency manual. Most of the émigrés did not even bother to change their names, since usually all that was necessary to defeat the CIC fi ling system was a minor variation in spelling. For example, the highest-ranking collaborator under the administration of General Wilhelm Kube, Dr. Ivan Ermachenko, emigrated to the U.S. as Dr. John Jermaczenko, a permissible phonetic transliteration from the Cyrillic alphabet of Byelorussia into the Latin alphabet of Poland. Most Belarus émigrés had already listed their birthplace as Polish Byelorussia to avoid the earlier repatriation efforts, and so use of the Polish form of their surname was consistent with their previous cover stories.

The name translation ploy was so successful that it enabled the majority of Byelorussians to escape detection from the even more antiquated fi ling systems of the FBI. The Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice did not even pretend to maintain an effi cient fi ling system. Some Byelorussians were picked up in a post-emigration check by the CIA’s more effi cient cross-language indexing system and were referred to the FBI, but Wisner had arranged for prominent religious leaders in various ethnic groups to vouch for the émigrés as anti-communists who were being victimized by accusers of dubious backgrounds. These religious leaders, many of whom were themselves described in SS documents as key collaborators, played an important role in defeating the CIC screening system. Since few legitimate refugees, especially concentration camp survivors, had retained their birth certifi cates, the IRO permitted priests to issue substitute baptismal or marriage certifi cates. Father Mikalaj Lapitski, an Orthodox priest mentioned favorably in Einsatzgruppen reports and a delegate to the Minsk congress in 1944, was a prolifi c producer of instant documentation for the Belarus network. The papers almost invariably listed a Polish birthplace, were translated to show a Polish variant of the Byelorussian surname and – at least for the younger collaborators – included a slight change in the date of birth so as to show that they had not been old enough for military service during the war. Lapitski’s forgeries appear in numerous immigration records, and his monument in the Belarus cemetery at South River, New Jersey, is equal in prominence to that of Otrowsky.114 Some of the Byelorussian Nazis, however, had become so notorious that merely withholding information from the CIC would not be enough. Kushel, for example, had already been described in the 1948 CIC Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual as the Byelorussian Minister of War, a member of the puppet government, and the leader of the Regensburg DP camp. It was one thing for the CIC to ignore General Clay’s favored Nazis while they were living in Germany; it would be another to defy Congress and clear them for visas. Apparently acting on instructions, Kushel moved to another part of Germany, where he was less well known, and there applied for a visa to the United States.

In fact, central CIC fi les in Stuttgart contained several indexes for Kushel under various spellings, but which clearly established that he “controls the White Ruthenian Veterans League and was also the leading fi gure for the German SD” (USAIRR fi le No. XE198433-1181045) and was the same Kushel who “was in the 29th SS Grenadier Division, Russische No. 2” (which later became the Belarus Brigade of the 30th SS Division). Other CIC fi les connect Kushel’s “Veterans League” with reports of an anticommunist guerrilla force being recruited by Americans in the DP camps. The fi les also list Kushel as a former cabinet offi cial in the Nazi puppet government of Byelorussia. Not only was this information withheld from immigration offi cials, but a cover story had been fabricated in its place. Kushel was issued a visa (No. 5291/73) at Munich on May 18, 1950. In New York, he established a front group for Wisner’s Offi ce of Policy Coordination. He then became an FBI informant and betrayed OPC’s plans to recruit Byelorussian ex-Nazis for paratroop operations behind Russian lines. Nice work for a former SS General. Stankievich’s route to the United States was less direct. Having emerged unscathed from his denunciation by the Soviets in 1948, he had been put to work running an OPC-funded newspaper for Byelorussian émigré in the American-zone DP camps. Soon after the CIC rejected his fi rst visa application, Stankievich moved to another region of Germany and applied again. And again, the CIC blocked the application. Stankievich fi led an appeal to the U.S. Displaced Persons Commission, but before Clay’s staff could intervene, the CIC submitted a series of scathing reports to the DP Commission to the effect that: The CIC report then went on to list chronologically every Nazi position held by Stankievich, including mayor of Borissow, national deputy of the Byelorussian Central Council, and fi nally, editor-in-chief of Ranitsa in Berlin just before the collapse of Nazi Germany.116 To make sure the DP Commission did not miss the point, the CIC noted that Ranitsa was “a pro-Nazi, anti-Allied paper printed in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:137:896be8c216ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4250, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 138, "text": "CIC submitted a series of scathing reports to the DP Commission to the effect that: The CIC report then went on to list chronologically every Nazi position held by Stankievich, including mayor of Borissow, national deputy of the Byelorussian Central Council, and fi nally, editor-in-chief of Ranitsa in Berlin just before the collapse of Nazi Germany.116 To make sure the DP Commission did not miss the point, the CIC noted that Ranitsa was “a pro-Nazi, anti-Allied paper printed in the White Ruthenian language under full control of the German authorities. Subject assigned many positions of trust in the German administration throughout the war.” As a result of the Stankievich report and other documentation, the U.S. Displaced Persons Commission simply stopped considering visas from Byelorussian collaborators in 1950; anyone found to have been a member of the Ostrowsky government in any position from the lowest municipal offi cial to national deputies was automatically rejected as a member of a “movement hostile” to the United States. As if to chide Wisner for the dubious backgrounds of the people he was recruiting, the CIC mentioned a secret fi le to the DP Commission that showed that Stankievich was a possible Soviet double agent: Briefl y, Subject worked fi rst with the Soviets, then with the Nazis, then again for the Soviets. He appears to be an opportunist who will work for anyone who will pay him…. Subject is considered a security risk…. This should be suffi cient to preclude [Stankievich’s] appeal beyond Amberg. However, we have additional information in our Secret fi les still more damning, which can be forwarded…. Even this did not keep Stankievich from trying to emigrate again. His “blue fi le” at Fort Meade contains four separate visa applications over the next ten years, all of which were rejected before he fi nally got to the United States in 1959. By that time OPC had penetrated CIA offi ces abroad and were circumventing the Parole Powers Act by issuing their own visas to foreigners recruited for intelligence purposes. The State Department urged the CIA to make these visas look “as normal as possible.” It was nothing less than treason against the US Constitution granting exclusive power to Congress on immigration matters.117 The American consulate in Stuttgart was the center of Wisner’s visa mill. As soon as news of the Displaced Persons Act reached the camps, the handful of American offi cials were besieged by refugees who wished to emigrate to the United States. Some of them were in a state of panic, fearing that there would not be enough visas for everyone. The wife of one consular offi cial said that her husband was approached by a woman who offered to trade a handkerchief full of diamonds for visas.

The wife of one consular offi cial said that her husband was approached by a woman who offered to trade a handkerchief full of diamonds for visas. Procedures established by the Displaced Persons Act that governed the issuance of visas were complex, and consular offi cials depended upon inquiries made by other agencies in determining eligibility. The system required American charities to obtain blank sponsorship forms for a certain number of refugees and then to receive lists of eligible applicants from the IRO. The IRO forwarded each individual refugee application and sponsorship form to the U.S. Displaced Persons Commission, along with a detailed questionnaire to make certain that the applicant met the IRO’s qualifi cations as a victim of Nazi oppression. The commission sent the paperwork to the CIC for a further background investigation. Making false statements on the form was a criminal offense, but many refugees altered their backgrounds to avoid repatriation to their Communist-occupied homelands. Neither the Army nor the Displaced Persons Commission could do much to detect such falsifi cations, for the Soviet Union refused to cooperate with the IRO in providing background information on the refugees. Strong efforts were made by some to identify war criminals and Nazis attempting to fl ee to the United States and other Western countries, but the harassed offi cials had almost no investigative staff and were faced with a mountain of paperwork. With applications for visas piling up in Stuttgart, attempts were made to decentralize operations. Consular sub-offi ces were opened up in the larger DP camps, such as Regensburg, which was controlled by the Belarus Brigade, and the OPC used its agents to help subvert the system.118 Having short-circuited the CIC background checks, the Byelorussian Nazis had little trouble with the rest of the visa process. Most of the applicants sailed with their families to the United States from Bremerhaven on converted troopships. Passenger manifests show that many of the collaborators traveled in groups, an indication that their visas had been processed simultaneously. The voyage to America was supposed to give the CIA and the FBI suffi cient time to run fi nal background checks, since in the rush to help the starving refugees neither agency had been given enough advance warning to investigate before the visas were issued.[3] As a result, the CIA frequently identifi ed Byelorussian Nazis to the FBI only after they had arrived in America. Unlike the regular “quota” émigrés, the displaced persons were not subjected to long delays at Hackensack, Ellis Island, or the other immigration ports. They were expedited with the help of American charities, such as the World Church Service, which had provided initial sponsorship.

They were expedited with the help of American charities, such as the World Church Service, which had provided initial sponsorship. [Allen Dulles’s brother, John Foster Dulles, was then a senior leader in the World Church Service.]Once the Nazis were in America, tracing them became diffi cult. They only had to register once a year, and the Immigration Service’s record-keeping was abysmal. By the time the CIA’s objections reached the FBI, the Byelorussian Nazis were already settled in South River, Cleveland, Chicago, New York, or in numerous smaller communities in America. There they became part of the well-funded émigré apparatus. The Byelorussians had lawyers to defend them, politicians to endorse them, and, most important, trusted FBI informants to vouch for them as good anti-communists. The CIC’s denunciations had little effect, other than to help the FBI identify potential recruits for its network of informers. The FBI, after all, is part of the Department of Justice which had helped OPC design the illegal immigration system in the fi rst place. By the end of 1949, most of the leading Byelorussian collaborators, with the active assistance of Wisner and the OPC, had either evaded the restrictions designed to keep them out of the United States or were on their way. Once the leaders had arrived, they arranged sponsors for their followers, and the pyramid of Nazi emigration was begun. In one case, in 1951, a State Department offi cial named Vedeler stumbled across evidence of Wisner’s recruiting efforts. Believing that the operation was being conducted by CIA, he was delighted to blow the whistle on a rival agency and sent a lengthy memorandum to the State Department. It was immediately given to Wisner. Vedeler’s memorandum and a cover letter are one of the few extant documents discussing OPC activities during this period. One of the interesting features of the Vedeler memorandum is the notation that the agent in charge of setting up one of the Baltic “governments-in-exile” was the same person previously employed by the Displaced Persons Commission to advise it on which Baltic Nazi collaborators should be granted or denied visas. Before working for the State Department, Vedeler had previously worked for Military Intelligence, and, according to his Army dossier, was something of an expert on the role of Baltic collaborators in the SS auxiliary police. Recently, the same agent, now retired, candidly admitted working on covert operations in the Baltics, but he denied the very information which I had obtained from his own reports to the Army.

He was subsequently recruited by Richard Sullivan, my superior at OSI, as an advisor on other Nazi war crimes cases. If the Justice Department’s efforts to deport Nazis was bad, the Australian, Canadian, British and German efforts were an outright farce. Wisner’s smuggling scheme did hit the occasional snag, however. Arendt Wagenaar, his man in the Stuttgart consulate, lacked a passion for anonymity, the hallmark of a good covert agent, and his erratic behavior focused an unwelcome spotlight on the OPC plan. A Dutchman who had worked for the OSS during the war, Wagenaar had been hired by the State Department as the chief visa investigator in the consulate. His true position became apparent after some of the consular offi cers complained to the consul general that he did no work. They were bluntly told to stay out of Wagenaar’s business, making it obvious to the entire staff that he was an intelligence agent. Wagenaar also attracted the attention of the CIC because his mistress had been secretary to the local Gestapo chief, and Wagenaar appeared to be selling visas to refugees. The CIC missed the mark by only a slight margin. Wagenaar was selling visas, but not for money. He exchanged them for information from Emanuel Jasiuk, one of the most important Byelorussian collaborators. Jasiuk had a remarkable history. He was a native of Newish, Byelorussia, and had attended the University of Likge in Belgium. Following graduation, he and his wife attempted to make their living as schoolteachers during the harsh Polish occupation of Byelorussia. When the Soviet Union annexed his homeland in 1939, Jasiuk fl ed, along with many other anticommunist intellectuals, to German-held Warsaw. There he worked with other disgruntled teachers who formed the hard core of pro-Nazi nationalist agitators. He was among the fi rst to join Byelorussian “self-help” committees sponsored by the SS in 1940-41. When Dr. Six came to Warsaw to recruit guides for his Einsatzgruppen, Jasiuk was an early volunteer. He returned to Byelorussia soon after the invasion of the Soviet Union and was installed by the SS as mayor of Kletsk. With broad Slavic features almost always wreathed in smiles, Jasiuk was regarded as an amiable fellow. One of his main tasks was to draw up lists of Polish intellectuals and Communist sympathizers for the Germans. The Einsatzgruppen swept through Kletsk, rounded up hundreds of suspects at Jasiuk’s direction, and murdered them.

The Einsatzgruppen swept through Kletsk, rounded up hundreds of suspects at Jasiuk’s direction, and murdered them. In 1942, Jasiuk, now county chief, or “Kreisleiter,” was energetic in preparing the “fi nal solution” of the Jews of Kletsk. Jasiuk’s police herded all the Jews in the area – thousands of men, women, and children – into a barbed-wire compound in the middle of the city. The usual pattern of extortions, threats, and increasing acts of violence followed, until Jasiuk arranged for the massacre of the entire ghetto. Soviet eyewitnesses, Jewish survivors, and some of Jasiuk’s colleagues who later informed on him reported that his police did not repeat the mistakes of Borissow. They dug large trenches behind the Arinskaya Church in Kletsk, out of sight but within walking distance of the ghetto. The Byelorussian police lined the roads and escorted the Jews in columns of a hundred, men fi rst, according to the familiar pattern, then women and children. A small detachment of Germans and specially selected Byelorussians accomplished the actual execution. Guards were left atop the graves until the ground stopped trembling and the muffl ed cries were still. There was no chance for anyone to crawl out. In one day Jasiuk murdered the entire Jewish population of the county, conservatively estimated at more than 5,000 people. The Nazis took notice of Jasiuk’s efforts and promoted him to county chief of Stolpce, a much larger area. Contemporary newspapers related that Jasiuk proved adept at giving pro-Nazi speeches, but he apparently lacked the fl air for anti-partisan operations that caused many of his contemporaries to advance under the SS to key positions in the national puppet government. Jasiuk was a valuable utility man, working tirelessly with religious collaborators from the local independent Byelorussian Orthodox church and others to increase the SS stranglehold on the civilian population. Ostrowsky selected him as one of the featured speakers at the collaborators’ convention in Minsk in 1944. Jasiuk was one of the fi rst to be evacuated to Germany when Byelorussia fell to the Red Army in the summer of 1944. In Berlin he worked to organize other exiled collaborators into the Belarus Brigade. Just as the Reich was about to collapse, he was given forged identity papers listing him as a prisoner of war who had joined the Free Polish forces led by General Anders.

Learning that Wagenaar was seeking intelligence information, Jasiuk brought him some maps of the Soviet airfi elds in the Urals that the Byelorussian collaborators had taken from the SS fi les and captured Soviet archives in Minsk. Much of the information furnished by Jasiuk was later discovered to be worthless. Nevertheless, he provided Wagenaar with an introduction to the Nazi underground that the agent exploited vigorously. Wagenaar hired Jasiuk as his translator,[4] and together they traveled all over occupied Germany establishing liaison with the scattered battalions of the Belarus Brigade. As offi cial State Department employees, the two were permitted unrestricted travel. Usually a vice consul from Stuttgart, more or less oblivious to Wagenaar’s true role, accompanied them on their rounds to provide cover. When Wisner directed that an attempt be made to reconcile the various Byelorussian factions, Jasiuk accompanied an Ostrowsky delegation to France to try to reach an agreement with the Abramtchik group. During this journey, cover was provided by the Polish Central Commission at the request of General Anders. Wisner decided to bring Jasiuk to America, where he could continue his recruiting activities among the Byelorussians already here. The CIC was asked by the consulate to convene a special hearing to expedite Jasiuk’s visa. Wagenaar and two State Department offi cials appeared on Jasiuk’s behalf and testifi ed that he had performed invaluable services “of a highly confi dential nature” for an unnamed American intelligence agency. The State Department offi cials then corroborated Jasiuk’s fi ctitious biography, which put him in a monastery and then on a farm in Bavaria as a slave laborer during World War II.119 The CIC was not taken in, and subsequently launched a burglary of Wagenaar’s offi ce in order to inspect the documents on Jasiuk.120 They recognized most of Jasiuk’s paperwork as recently produced forgeries and notifi ed the State Department that they were preparing to arrest Jasiuk and Wagenaar. Wagenaar had friends in the French Surete who were called in to provide cover, and a high offi cial in the French intelligence service protested that the CIC was meddling with one of its most valuable operations. After being reprimanded by the State Department, the CIC dropped its investigation of the allegation that Wagenaar was selling visas.121 Within a few months after Jasiuk had emigrated, the CIC received a tip from an informant linking Jasiuk to Dimitri Kasmowich, the former Smolensk police chief, who had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:143:4e34d1590a1e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4256, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "French Surete who were called in to provide cover, and a high offi cial in the French intelligence service protested that the CIC was meddling with one of its most valuable operations.

The CIC learned that Kasmowich had been previously rejected for emigration and had been taken into custody for falsifying a visa application. Under questioning, Kasmowich ran through a variety of cover stories and false identities before acknowledging that he was being recruited by the Americans for a secret intelligence mission. The OPC tried to persuade the CIC to drop the charges against him, but the CIC sensed there was something suspicious about the connection between Kasmowich and Jasiuk. The agency pressed ahead with the case against Kasmowich until State Department offi cials requested that he be released. In return, State promised to make certain that he would never receive a visa to come to the United States. Instead, Kasmowich was smuggled to England, where he lived under the name of Zarechny.122 The incident was not yet closed, however. Suspicions aroused, the CIC located several informants who identifi ed Jasiuk and Kasmowich as Nazi collaborators. In fact, Kasmowich was a cousin of Michael Vitushka, who had led the Black Cat guerrilla band behind Soviet lines at the end of the war. Kasmowich himself had undergone parachute and commando training at the SS school at Dahlwitz, but had fl ed to Switzerland at the end of the war. The CIC had obtained a copy of a letter from Jasiuk to his old friend “Captain Wagner” (the copy is in Wagenaar’s CIC fi le). The letter introduced Kasmowich as a former police chief in Byelorussia under the Nazis who Jasiuk said “would be perfect for the purposes of your organization.” Wagenaar told the CIC that a “Mr. J.” had obtained valuable intelligence information from Kasmowich. The CIC, however, was not fooled. States, and they blamed the Air Force, which they believed was Jasiuk‘s controller, for allowing it to operate. The Air Force was mystifi ed; Jasiuk had been only a routine source who had turned over some minor documents on airfi eld runways and had assisted in putting together an information handbook on Byelorussia. In fact, Jasiuk had been working for an OPC mission wearing Air Force uniforms. Still oblivious to the OPC connection, CIC offi cials were even more angered at the realization that Jasiuk had orchestrated the escape of at least eight major war criminals by means of the visas he had secured from Wagenaar when he was only a minor informant for the Air Force.

To prevent the cancellation of any more of its prosecutions, the CIC submitted a formal complaint up the chain of command on the handling of Jasiuk. The protest fi nally reached General John Weckerling, chief of Military Intelligence at the Pentagon, who agreed that the Nazi smuggling operation was deplorable.123 The FBI had jurisdiction over fugitives wanted for trial on war crimes charges who had entered the United States, so Weckerling personally apprised J. Edgar Hoover of the affair. He told Hoover on January 2, 1951 that the Air Force had apparently used a Nazi war criminal as an informant and that the State Department had permitted him to enter the United States. Hoover expressed an interest in the case, for it seemed likely to fi t in with his plans to expand the FBI’s domestic intelligence capabilities. When FBI agents went to visit Jasiuk, it was not to arrest him but to recruit him. Like SS General Kushel, Jasiuk could keep Hoover apprised of gossip about what OPC was up to. Hoover spent as much time spying on American intelligence agencies as he did on the enemy. Jasiuk and the other Byelorussian Nazis had found their ultimate protector, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the US Department of Justice. Following his diffi culties with the Byelorussians, Wisner attempted to circumvent similar immigration problems with Ukrainian Nazis. But the repeated Soviet denunciations of the alleged links between Stephan Bandera and other Ukrainian war criminals and American and British intelligence agencies kept the spotlight focused on them. The Ukrainian delegate to the United Nations charged that Bandera and other Ukrainian Nazis, such as Andrei Melnik, were running special schools to train cadres in sabotage and intelligence work against the Soviet Union. He listed numerous atrocities committed by them. Arguably the highest ranking Ukrainian Nazi to ever enter the United States was Mykola Lebed. Lebed was Bandera’s chief of the national security service, the SB. When Army intelligence picked up Lebed, he turned over thousands of pages of dossiers on his Nazi recruits. The Attorney General promptly protected Lebed from arrest and deportation by granting him permanent citizenship under the 1949 “Hundred Persons A Year Act.” Because of the Congressional prohibition against using the Act to protect “Nazis, murderers, and persons of that sort,” the Attorney General concocted a fi ctitious biography of Lebed and sent it to the CIA and the Immigration", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:145:99e8512f27c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4258, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "the SB.

In the spring of 1951, he learned that another of Lebed’s SB intelligence agents had been detained at Ellis Island. He was charged with possession of false documents as well as being a member of the torture squad (SB) of the Nazi-sponsored Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the OUN/Bandera. Rather than risk another false entry under the 100 persons Act, Wisner decided to evade Congressional prohibitions entirely , and had the following letter sent to the headquarters of the Immigration and Naturalization Service: 2. There are at least twenty former or active members of the SB of OUN/Bandera in the United States at the present time. Although the SB is known to have used extra-legal methods while investigating or interrogating suspected Soviet agents, there have been few cases to date where it was possible to pin a specifi c criminal activity on any individual belonging to the SB and take court action. Since the SB kept elaborate fi les and conducted investigations on Ukrainians and suspected Soviet agents of other nationalities, no serious attempt has ever been made by American offi cials in Germany to disband the SB. In the past fi ve years the SB has been chronically unable to cooperate wholeheartedly with American intelligence representatives in Germany, primarily because the price set by Stephan Bandera for complete cooperation involved types of political recognition and commitments to his group which no American in Germany was in a position to make.[5] Operating independently, the SB has upon occasion been more of a headache to American intelligence than a boon. Nevertheless in wartime a highly nationalistic Ukrainian political group with its own security service could conceivably be a great asset. …Alienating such a group could, on the other hand, have no particular advantage to the United States either now or in war time. At the end of the last war many members of the OUN came to Western Europe to avoid capture by the advancing Soviets. The OUN reformed in Western Europe with its headquarters in Munich. It fi rst came to the attention of American authorities when the Russians demanded extradition of Bandera and many other anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalists as war criminals. Luckily the attempt to locate these anti-Soviet Ukrainians was sabotaged by a few far-sighted Americans who warned the persons concerned to go into hiding.

[Emphasis added.] From 1945 to 1948 members of OUN and of UPA arrived from the Soviet Ukraine to Western Germany on foot. The messages they and returning German prisoners of war brought conclusively confi rmed that the OUN and the UPA were continuing the fi ght against the Soviets, with the weapons and ammunition which the retreating German armies had left behind. Over 35,000 members of the Russian secret police (MVD-MKGB) have been killed by OUN-UPA since the end of the last war. In other words, the main activities of the Wisner’s letter must have caused a commotion at the INS. It was as close as he dared come to disclosing that OPC was using CIA money and CIA cover to provide “left-behind” arms and ammunition to underground assassination teams inside Eastern Europe. But that was not all. The letter conclusively established that Wisner lied to the INS.[6] He fraudulently claimed that the OUN was not a Nazi-sponsored organization and that its members had never collaborated with the Germans. At the end of several paragraphs of fi ctional history, Wisner stated: In simple terms, the Germans wanted from the Ukrainians only food and supplies for their armies and forced labor for their factories. The Germans used all means necessary to force the cooperation which the Ukrainians were unwilling to give. Thus, by summer 1941 a battle raged on Ukrainian soil between two ruthless exploiters and persecutors of the Ukrainian people, the Third Reich and Soviet Russia. The OUN and the partisan army it created in late 1942, UPA, fought bitterly against both the Germans and the Soviet Russians. This was a complete fabrication. The CIC had an agent who photographed eleven volumes of Lebed’s secret internal fi les of OUN/ Bandera. These fi les clearly show how most of its members worked for the Gestapo or SS as policemen, executioners, partisan hunters, and municipal offi cials. The OUN contribution to the German war effort was signifi cant, including the raising of volunteers for several SS divisions. It was precisely because of its work with the Nazis that Wisner wanted to hire the OUN for his Special Forces. The Ukrainian letter succeeded in fooling the immigration offi cials, however, and OUN/Bandera was subsequently taken off the inimical list.

By the time the DP Act expired in 1952, 400,000 immigrants had come to the United States. Among them were hundreds if not thousands of important Nazi collaborators from Byelorussia, the Ukraine, the Baltic states, and the Balkans, including the nucleus of Wisner’s “Special Forces.” During the same four-year period, Wisner’s OPC enjoyed virtually unlimited freedom of action and had grown to the point that it was consuming more than half the CIA’s annual budget. Wisner’s private army had launched an undeclared war against the Soviet Union. He had defi ed the congressional ban on smuggling Nazis; he had misappropriated government funds to buy arms for ex-Nazi terrorists; and he had obstructed justice by sheltering fugitive war criminals who had been denounced by the Nuremberg Tribunal, the United Nations, and the Congress of the United States. He had, moreover, infl icted a crucial defeat on his arch rivals in the CIC and CIA. The State Department had won the fi rst round. [3] At least one Byelorussian Nazi entered the United States illegally from Canada and came back and forth several times. Immigration and Naturalization Service fi les indicate he was never issued a visa or residence permit , and no visas are on record for several other émigrés. OPC simply sent letters to the American border guards at Niagara Falls to let the people across. That is how Nikolai Abramtchik, former Nazi Minster of Intelligence and Communist Double Agent, was able to enter America at will. [6] The letter also enclosed two visa applications – one admitting service in the OUN/SB, and the other concealing that fact. Apparently, the State Department knew all along that the agent had lied to get into America. It was not the last occasion on which State suddenly produced a second visa application to prevent deportation of an OPC agent who had misrepresented his SS connection on one form and concealed it on another. On June 25-26, 1949, the remaining members of the Belarus network in Europe held their last conference in Germany at the Backnang DP camp near Stuttgart. A motion was made and approved to “transfer the entire organization to the United States, inasmuch as all the offi cers were there.” This was not an understatement: with the exception of Radoslaw Ostrowsky, who had gone to Argentina because his record was too well known for him to obtain a visa, virtually every cabinet-level Byelorussian Nazi had been smuggled into America.

Franz Kushel, Jury Sobolewsky, Emanuel Jasiuk – the leadership of a movement branded “hostile to the United States” – had been issued visas in violation of federal law, and were now on the road to becoming American citizens. One needed only to compare the Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual for Byelorussia prepared by the CIC in 1948 with the immigration rolls to realize how effective Wisner’s smuggling operations had been. More than 300 Byelorussian Nazis arrived in the United States, most of whom would become American citizens. (An even larger number of Ukrainian Nazis are suspected to have been smuggled in.) Wisner’s own star had risen too. The announcement of the Soviet atom bomb in 1949 and the outbreak of war in Korea the following year led to sweeping changes in America’s intelligence community. Dissatisfi ed with Admiral Hillenkoetter’s performance, President Truman replaced him as Director of Central Intelligence with General Walter Bedell Smith.125 Brilliant and acerbic, Smith had been General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s chief of staff during World War II and was credited with being the driving force behind the American victory in Europe. A postwar tour as envoy to Moscow had left him with a hatred of the Soviet Union. Smith was determined to increase the effectiveness of the CIA by bringing the OPC under his control. Although the OPC was formally a part of the CIA, Wisner had acted independently, and there was considerable bureaucratic infi ghting between his shop and the CIA’S Offi ce of Special Operations. They had squabbled over local jurisdictions, stealing each other’s agents and occasionally blowing each other’s operations. Such intra-agency raiding was not uncommon. A retired military intelligence agent revealed recently that OPC had offered him a high-paying job with the stipulation that he steal the list of agents working for the Army in that part of Germany and turn it over to his prospective employers. He refused, but others did not. OPC was envied, feared, and resented by the other agencies because of its power, infl uence, and limitless fi nancial support. Between 1950 and 1952, Smith took several steps to encourage cooperation between OPC and OSO. Allen Dulles, Wisner’s old friend and chief, was brought in as Deputy Director of Plans to supervise Wisner’s operations. Not long afterward, Dulles was named Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, and when Eisenhower was elected President in 1952 he became DCI.

Among Smith’s last acts was to merge OSO and OPC into the Directorate of Plans with Wisner in charge. All CIA covert actions were now controlled by the men who had planned the “Special Forces” program. The use of Eastern European émigrés to fi ght a clandestine guerrilla war against the Soviet Union had not received offi cial sanction from the White House, but in 1953 its two most ardent advocates, Dulles and Wisner, were in a position to continue the secret war on their own.126 [Although declassifi ed fi les now show that Eisenhower gave more than a wink and a nod to the Dulles’s nefarious and inevitably futile efforts to roll back communism]. With unlimited funds and support available, Wisner stepped up his activities among the Byelorussians in the United States. Soon after his arrival in this country, Franz Kushel, now the leader of the old Abramtchik faction, was able to establish the White Ruthenian Institute of Arts and Sciences at 8 Alabama Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. Abramtchik himself remained in Paris. The institute churned out intelligence reports supposedly generated by Kushel’s network of spies in Eastern Europe. In reality, most of these agents had long since been captured by the Soviets. Kushel fabricated his reports from newspapers, old books, radio broadcasts, and gossip among the émigrés. Nevertheless, Wisner was so pleased by the results that he expanded the number of émigré institutes, and established a headquarters in Munich where access to the “informants” would be greater. The secretary and later chairman of the board of the Institute of Russian Research in Munich was Stanislaw Stankievich.127 Funding for these “research institutes,” which were little more than front groups for ex-Nazi intelligence offi cers, came from the American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism, now known as Radio Liberty.[1] The committee was actually a front for OPC. AMCOMLIB was originally a subsidiary organization of the National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE), which was set up by George Kennan in the State Department long before the CIA became involved.128 Money for the NCFE and AMCOMLIB was raised through the “private” fund-raising efforts of the “Crusade for Freedom.” General Clay, who had retired from his post as military governor of the American Zone of Germany in 1949, was chairman of the Crusade.

The State Department laundered the money through private charities, such as the Rockefeller Fund, the Carnegie Fund, and the Ford Foundation’s Russian Research Committee, which in turn claimed credit in public for their generous donations. Some of the funds went through corporate conduits, such as the Radio Corporation of America, which in turn “donated” equipment to Wisner’s front groups. ${ \\underline { { 1 2 9 } } } \\mathrm { I n }$ return, the Dulles brothers awarded General Sarnoff of RCA a no-bid contract to help build the wiretapping system of the NSA. Only a few of the more favored Byelorussian Nazis found employment with AMCOMLIB. While the intelligentsia with advanced degrees obtained jobs at local hospitals, academic institutions, and architectural fi rms, the rest took positions as laborers and factory workers. Almost without exception, the Byelorussians fi led applications to become American citizens. Now that they were safely in the United States they needed only to wait out the fi veyear residency requirement. While the Abramtchik faction was centered at Kushel’s base in Brooklyn, Ostrowsky’s followers, led by Jury Sobolewsky, were expanding their foothold in South River, New Jersey, the headquarters of a growing Belarus network. Between 1948 and 1950 over 200 Byelorussian Nazis, together with their families, arrived in South River. It was a quiet little town on the fringe of New Jersey’s industrial belt where large numbers of Ukrainian and Byelorussian refugees had settled after World War I. The new arrivals kept to themselves and, unlike other émigrés, did not encourage publication of their social activities in the local newspapers. They built their own parish church, established a meeting hall and business offi ces, and began organizing charities and religious groups to sponsor still more émigrés. Relatives brought in relatives and arranged jobs for them in the factories of Passaic and Newark. In time, a local lawyer was hired to assist with the immigration process. Later on, as the number of immigrants increased, new parishes were established near the old Byelorussian communities in Chicago, Cleveland, and Toronto.130 Toronto was the Nazi headquarters for the North American continent because of the large number of émigré presses established by the British Secret Service there.

It is quite easy to fi nd Nazi front groups in Canada: they were all members of the Anti-Bolshevik Block of Nations. ABN was Kim Philby’s umbrella group for the Nazi networks he peddled to the Dulles brothers. I told all of this in great detail to Alti Rodal, historian of the Canadian Deschene Commission. Almost every word on how the British dumped the Nazis in Canada was blacked out of the Deschene Report to Parliament. The British SIS station at Windsor kept shuttling the Nazis across the border to America. Belarus activity in America was directed by Sobolewsky, vice president of the Byelorussian Central Council. As time went on, it became necessary to expand into the New York area. Formal charters were obtained for various front organizations, but most of the leaders of the local groups had one thing in common: They had all been Nazi intelligence offi cers who had helped the Einsatzgruppen direct the subjugation of Byelorussia.131 With Ostrowsky still in hiding in Argentina, where he had gone with the assistance of the British, Sobolewsky decided to try to gain public recognition for his organization.132 He sent Emanuel Jasiuk, now head of the South River chapter, to speak at a Ukrainian convention in Washington, D.C.133 Vice president Alben Barkley unwittingly shared the same platform with men who had fought against America and helped obliterate the Jewish population of their countries. To establish his credentials, Jasiuk carried a commission that read: The commission was signed by Radoslaw Ostrowsky as President of the Byelorussian Central Council and bore the seal of his wartime administration. Ostrowsky was once again trying to rehabilitate his government by dropping the cover name of the “Byelorussian Central Representation,” which he had used since 1945. In February 1951 the fi rst Belarus convention in America was held at South River. It was decided to link up with similar exile organizations from the Ukrainian, Latvian, and Estonian communities. The Belarus network hoped to persuade American public offi cials that the “White Ruthenian” émigrés in America were willing to do anything to defeat the Communists. Letters were sent to both President Truman and General Eisenhower, promising to supply armed troops for the struggle against communism. American politicians were sought out to endorse Byelorussian nationalism, press releases were issued, and a series of local newspapers were established to link the scattered collaborators.134 Everything was in readiness for the day when Americans would realize that it was Ostrowsky’s Nazis,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:152:43997a63c822", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4265, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 153, "text": "offi cials that the “White Ruthenian” émigrés in America were willing to do anything to defeat the Communists.

They did not have long to wait. American and British equipment with which they had been supplied and to proclaim themselves as having been Soviet agents all along. The “Special Forces” training school in Germany was later discovered to be riddled with Soviet moles, one of whom had even earned a place on the faculty. Kim Philby, who was kept informed of Wisner’s secret operations, is usually blamed for the defeat of the fi rst waves of Special Forces. An attempt to parachute in Ukrainians with the hope of linking up with partisans who had been left behind failed, prompting a macabre epitaph from Philby: “I do not know what happened to the parties concerned. But I can make an informed guess.”135 In another, highly publicized incident in 1950, Wisner had recruited a force of some 500 Albanians, armed and trained them in Greece, and sent them over the Albanian frontier to depose the Communist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. They were met by waiting Communist forces and slaughtered. After Philby’s connection with the Soviets was discovered, he was charged with betraying to Moscow the plans for the invasion. But it appears that much of the damaging information came to the Soviets not by means of high-level agents such as Philby but through the low-ranking Communist informants who had permeated the émigré community at every level. Since Wisner’s plans centered on the émigrés, it was not surprising that Soviet moles were among his very fi rst volunteers.136 Wisner’s right hand man in charge of émigré affairs for OPC, Carmel Offi e, was later discovered to have been a lifelong communist agent. With a Soviet spy in charge of American guerilla warfare against the Soviet Union, it is not surprising which side had the greater number of casualties. Walter Bedell Smith told a class at the Army War College that the “covert agents” that the intelligence agencies were trying to slip into the Soviet Union had an enormous fatality rate.

The large numbers of Ostrowsky’s people with Nazi backgrounds had once been a source of embarrassment for Meanwhile, the FBI decided to do some recruiting of its own. Two agents went to South River to question Emanuel Jasiuk. The agents knew about Jasiuk‘s Nazi background from the CIC complaint to J. Edgar Hoover; what they wanted was information on the Byelorussians in America. Jasiuk agreed to provide it. He described how the Germans had allowed the Byelorussians to form an independent state during the war, but he characterized the government as democratically elected, with a president and a congress. No mention was made of atrocities, and most of the postwar history was concealed. Jasiuk was not sure how much the FBI knew about the Special Forces network behind the Iron Curtain, so he simply denied that his organization had any contacts with Communist countries. The FBI agents departed, but after reviewing the CIC allegations that Jasiuk had worked for the SS and had submitted lists of anti-Nazi Poles to be executed by the Germans, they returned three days later for a more thorough interrogation. This time, Jasiuk confessed that he had obtained his immigration visa through fraud. He admitted lying to the CIC screening offi cers when he concealed his background as mayor of Kletsk under the Nazis, because it would have caused him to be deported to the Soviet Union, where he would have been executed as a war criminal. Jasiuk defended his collaboration and that of others with the Nazis on the ground that resistance would have been useless. It should be noticed that the German forces did not coerce people like Jasiuk into service: there were more than enough willing collaborators to be found. Sobolewsky admitted that the Byelorussian Central Administration was the same as the Byelorussian Central Council, which had collaborated with the Germans during World War II. He told the FBI that the SS had permitted the government to be formed and said he had served as vice president under Ostrowsky. He admitted that the government had raised sixty-fi ve battalions for a national militia, but he neglected to mention that the battalions were later formed into the Belarus SS Brigade and had fought against the Americans.

He described the worldwide network under 0strowsky, with branches in England, Canada, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and Germany, and emphasized that his organization was dedicated to fi ghting communism. Sobolewsky took the hint and ordered one of his lieutenants to write to the Attorney General, displaying his anticommunist sentiments and downgrading the wartime collaboration with the Nazis.137 On April 13, 1952, one of Sobolewsky’s aides appeared at FBI headquarters in New York. Confi dent that he had nothing to fear, the aide provided a complete rundown of the postwar emigration from the DP camps, and even admitted that the BCC had changed its name to the BCR “so that the members could avoid being called war criminals during the time of crisis in Germany.” The FBI not only overlooked this remark but also helped him prepare the information that he would need for the Attorney General so that the Justice Department could protect them under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It was the beginning of a most cooperative relationship: the Byelorussians in South River assisted the FBI in untangling the charges of Soviet penetration permeating the émigré community, while the bureau (and its superiors in the Justice Department) protected the Byelorussians from being prosecuted as war criminals. Hoover’s decision not to bring the collaborators to court provided him with agents who delivered information on what his rivals in American intelligence were doing. In 1952 the OPC fi nally dumped the Abramtchik group and began shifting AMCOMLIB’s funding and programs to the Ostrowsky faction. Ostrowsky had moved to London with the approval of the British secret service, where he was working with OPC and the British in a new attempt to penetrate the Iron Curtain. Hoover’s informants started to provide information on AMCOMLIB’s change of strategy. They even discovered that Zarechny (Jasiuk’s old friend Dimitri Kasmowich, the Smolensk police chief) was heading up the military operations in London. Sobolewsky’s aide petitioned the Justice Department for clearance under the Foreign Agent section of the Internal Security Act of 1950. [In those days, the Justice Department had an entire National Security Division which later became the Internal Security Section of the Criminal Division.

McInerney, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, forwarded Sobolewsky’s request to the FBI to help determine whether the Byelorussians should register as agents of a foreign power. The FBI responded with a sanitized summary of some of its early interviews, showing that the Byelorussians were a truly anticommunist organization with no international connections. Sobolewsky was advised that a problem had arisen, and he subsequently mailed the Justice Department a lengthy report on the Byelorussian struggle for “liberation.” As a result of these letters, McInerney and Charles B. Murray of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department concluded that the Byelorussian group was not in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act because it did not communicate with foreign principals and all major offi cers were resident in the United States.138 In a sense it was true: those Byelorussian Nazis who mattered, with the exception of Ostrowsky, were now living in America. Like Frank Wisner, Ostrowsky was never at a loss for ideas. With his organization revived by the transfusion of American funds, he assigned Kasmowich to the task of recruiting volunteers in the United States, Germany, and Britain for a Byelorussian Liberation Movement to cause trouble for the Soviets. Ostrowsky also had a more subtle plan in mind. As a result of their membership in the Gramada in post-World War I Poland, both he and Sobolewsky were acquainted with some of the Communist offi cials who now ruled the country. In fact, the Byelorussians had hidden a few of their Polish Communist friends during the Nazi occupation. Ostrowsky informed Wisner that some of these men were now high offi cials in Polish security. Although they were Communists, they were also opposed to Russian imperialism and were willing to cooperate with the West. Such “black” operations appealed to Wisner. Not long before, he had masterminded a scheme in which scores of Communist Party offi cials had been discredited in Poland and the Soviet Union itself. Stalin was apparently convinced that a mass defection was taking place within the Communist Party and ordered a sweeping purge. If the reports are correct, Wisner’s disinformation campaign resulted in the liquidation of several thousand Party members who were falsely denounced for collaborating with Western intelligence. Wisner saw in Ostrowsky’s proposal a chance to penetrate deep into Communist territory by organizing a string of double agents who would feed false information to the Communists while alerting the OPC to Stalin’s moves. Millions of dollars in gold, bank notes, arms, and equipment were smuggled into Poland.

Millions of dollars in gold, bank notes, arms, and equipment were smuggled into Poland. Wisner believed it was important to establish the bona fi des of his double agents by giving them valuable secret information. Once these agents were accepted by the Communists the pipeline could be reversed. Within a few months dozens and then hundreds of Polish agents were reporting back to Wisner. The Polish “double agent” operation was in fact a scheme concocted by the KGB, the latest incarnation of the Soviet security apparatus. Wisner’s double agents were actually Communist triple agents. They had been using Ostrowsky’s men to identify the real traitors among them.139 The lists of anti-communists were sent to Moscow almost as soon as they were transmitted to Washington and London. Several of the leading agents were “turned around,” and more and more money and supplies were demanded for spy networks that were only a fi ction created by the KGB. Wisner fell for it. Millions of dollars and an untold number of agents were dispatched before the Communists decided to roll up the operation. Ostrowsky’s friends in Polish security helped direct the roundup of American- and British-funded agents in Poland. When the arrests were completed in 1952, nearly every important anticommunist contact with the West had been seized. For the fi rst time, Wisner realized that his émigré agents had been thoroughly penetrated by the Soviets. Angry at the loss of AMCOMLIB funding, the Abramtchik faction chose this moment to strike back. In 1953 an article was published in a Byelorussian-language newspaper in Germany attacking Kasmowich, Ostrowsky’s military coordinator. Kasmowich was described as a former Communist offi cial, a major Nazi collaborator, and now an employee of the British secret service. His cover blown, Kasmowich fell into a depression and began drinking heavily. One night he returned drunk to the apartment he and Ostrowsky shared, and was ordered not only from the premises but out of the Byelorussian Liberation Movement as well. Kasmowich refused to be dropped, and started proselytizing for public support. The few surviving operations in Poland and Byelorussia were threatened by the continuing factional rivalry. Wisner’s rivals in CIA/OSO and military intelligence were quick to criticize his failure. By 1954 he had spent, conservatively, tens of millions of dollars in an utterly fruitless effort to destroy the Communists from within. In fact, his reckless activities may have destroyed any hope of ever building an effective anticommunist intelligence network in Eastern Europe.

In fact, his reckless activities may have destroyed any hope of ever building an effective anticommunist intelligence network in Eastern Europe. One after another his “underground armies” had been eliminated, along with the innocent citizens who had helped them. Wisner’s deputy for certain Eastern European operations candidly admitted that OPC, like the other intelligence services, had recruited a number of ex-Nazi intelligence agents, and had engaged in a series of “political action” programs against regimes behind the Iron Curtain. Faced with a series of defeats, Wisner’s deputy had in 1952 presented Allen Dulles with a lengthy memorandum criticizing these programs as reckless. He visited Dulles at his home in Georgetown and explained that, as each program grew in size, the risk of Communist penetration had increased proportionately, leading inevitably to the disasters which had occurred, and which would occur in the future unless the programs were scaled down. Other CIA and OPC offi cials confi rmed that both Wisner and Dulles had been repeatedly warned that these grandiose programs were doomed to failure, but the advice was ignored. One offi cial, who knew Wisner well, suggested that Wisner, Dulles, and the other OSS veterans were captives of a “guerrilla war” mentality – it was diffi cult for them to see that what had worked so well in France during World War II might not be applicable in Eastern Europe. Another offi cial suggested that one effect of the McCarthy purges was to pressure the intelligence community to “do something, anything” about the Communist takeovers while at the same time making it politically unsafe to use any but the most right-wing groups to fi ght the Communists. The example was given of a senior OPC offi cial in Germany who was hounded out of the government for alleged left-wing sympathies. One of the most cogent explanations of why the Dulles brothers continued to fund such disastrous spy operations came from a woman who had participated in covert operations in Germany during this period. In her opinion, it mattered little whether the émigré groups were penetrated or not. If they produced good propaganda or intelligence, so much the better; if not, the group would be dropped after it was blown, and another recruited in its place. OPC simply wrote blank checks and waited to see if any of its investments paid off. It is easy to see how Wisner could have believed that, sooner or later, his apparently inexhaustible supply of money was bound to produce something more than a paper army of anti-communists.

It is easy to see how Wisner could have believed that, sooner or later, his apparently inexhaustible supply of money was bound to produce something more than a paper army of anti-communists. There is a more cynical explanation: the Dulles brothers expected nothing more from the Nazi spy networks than a convenient way to hide their client’s Nazi investments under a shroud of national security. In the end, tens of thousands of people behind the Iron Curtain died for nothing. It was all about the money. Doolittle was an old friend, and another committee member, Morris Hadley, knew Allen Dulles well. Even the policy guidelines for the committee were drafted by the OPC clique within the CIA. To no one’s surprise the Doolittle committee, far from condemning Wisner, issued a report in September 1954 suggesting that his operations be expanded: It is now clear that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and at whatever cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply. If the United States is to survive, longstanding American concepts of “fair play” must be reconsidered. We must develop effective espionage and counterespionage services and must learn to subvert, sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used against us. It may become necessary that the American people be made acquainted with, understand and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy.140 For the fi rst time since he became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Countries in 1947, Frank Wisner had received a form of offi cial endorsement for his covert action program. The Belarus network was a direct benefi ciary of Doolittle’s “Anti-Communist Manifesto.” Funding for the Byelorussian community in America was increased, and large numbers of them were hired as researchers for various government projects. Many of OPC‘s research requests were farmed out to public and private groups in order to provide cover, and more jobs for informants. The Operations Research Offi ce of the Pentagon was one such agency. ORO was doing historical research into the use of local collaborators by the Nazis in the hope of obtaining information of value in the event of an American invasion of Russia. Operation Pow-wow was the code name given the project. The voluminous material produced by ORO included a series of classifi ed manuals analyzing the Nazi documents concerning Byelorussia.

One entire manual was devoted to the Nazi use of local police in the area around Borissow. Only cursory mention was made of the atrocities that had been committed there. Still another paper discussed the political organizations established by the Nazis to control the population. Ostrowsky’s government was mentioned in detail, as was Sobolewsky’s earlier work under General Kube. Some of the reports on operations in Baltic countries indicated that they were written by persons who had been high-ranking Nazi collaborators themselves. Obviously, the “researchers” employed by ORO were either Nazis or individuals with a great deal of familiarity with their history.[3] Harvard University was also linked to Wisner’s research programs. The Harvard Institute for Russian Research was funded by OPC, using the Air Force Human Resources Research Institute as a conduit.141 Wisner commissioned a team of historians to interview Eastern European émigrés in the DP camps. The fi rst series of interviews was legitimate; the refugees provided historical, medical, sociological, and ethnological data on the Soviet Union. But any émigrés who displayed knowledge of Nazi collaborators or intelligence networks were subsequently referred to a second set of interrogators. The B-6 series of interviews, for example, covered such nonacademic topics as the best method for dropping paratroopers, the utility of Nazi antipartisan operations, the popularity of Nazi-sponsored political organizations, the successful uses of anticommunist propaganda, and the kind of reception certain Nazi leaders such as Ostrowsky had received from the local population. Several of those interviewed candidly acknowledged that they had held positions in Nazi police or intelligence organizations. One even admitted that he was hiding out because he was wanted as a major war criminal. Apparently they were more than willing to confess participation in criminal activities because they suspected that the person conducting the interview was more than just another Harvard researcher. One even demanded that he be provided with a visa to the United States through special channels so that he would not have to go through the usual screening. But Wisner’s OPC did more than fi nance research. Large numbers of Byelorussians and other Eastern European Nazis were hired to work in propaganda agencies. The two most important were Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, both of which were funded by the Crusade for Freedom. After 1953 these agencies turned sharply conservative in their staffi ng and in their funding of émigré groups in the United States. Instead of a representative mix of moderate nationalists and right-wingers, the various “national committees of liberation” became dominated by those who had been outright Nazi collaborators", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:160:f0dfd7fd02e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4273, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 161, "text": "other Eastern European Nazis were hired to work in propaganda agencies.

Instead of a representative mix of moderate nationalists and right-wingers, the various “national committees of liberation” became dominated by those who had been outright Nazi collaborators – at least no one would ever accuse them of being soft on communism. Radio Liberty was a haven for the Byelorussian Nazis. The operation had a White Ruthenian Desk, and it employed several members of the Belarus network who had served as Nazi propagandists, among them Anton Adamovitch, who acknowledged in a television interview that he had been a Nazi collaborator and worked for U.S. Army intelligence. He said he had told the FBI about his background at the time he was admitted to the United States and no objections were raised.[4] Stankievich became chairman of the Learned Council of the Institute of Russian Research in Munich, which had been placed under Radio Liberty. After Stankievich was overheard bragging about the mass execution at Borissow, one of the other émigrés asked an OPC liaison man whether it was wise to place a notorious war criminal in such a prominent position. The discussion was cut short. Stankievich was credited with being an important source of information. After all, he had exposed the Soviet agent who attempted to recruit him. Moreover, he was a major politician in the Abramtchik faction, having risen to become its vice president. Many of his followers were employed at Radio Liberty and its research staffs. Their academic credentials served them in good stead. When the famous Berlin wiretap tunnel was dug in 1953, the Byelorussians were hired to translate the voluminous Soviet conversations. Many took jobs with government research institutes or served as translators for the State Department and other government agencies. A few, including Kushel, were hired as consultants by military and academic organizations such as the Hoover Institution at Stanford. For the most part, the Byelorussian émigrés in the United States possessed modest jobs. They lived in old but well-maintained neighborhoods and kept to themselves. In South River, for instance, they concentrated in a triangle between Whitehead Avenue, Main Street, and Hillside Avenue, although several of the more prominent collaborators were located on the southwestern side of town, near Route 527. They kept their lawns trimmed, their houses painted, and they never got in trouble with the police, which was not surprising as one of their offspring became the Chief of Police. Most of their neighbors knew little about them. No one who was not part of the Belarus network, or a relative of a collaborator, was allowed to join their social groups.[5] No", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:161:9b1fb93a759f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4274, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 162, "text": "several of the more prominent collaborators were located on the southwestern side of town, near Route 527.

No one who was not part of the Belarus network, or a relative of a collaborator, was allowed to join their social groups.[5] No one who was not a member of the parish could be buried in St. Euphrosynia’s cemetery. The Belarus even had its own youth group, the Byelorussian-American Youth Organization, or BAYO. Now a social organization, BAYO was an outgrowth of the paramilitary “Boy Scout” units organized by Kushel in the DP camps. The BAYO monthly magazine was a valuable tool for learning the names of the Belarus members living in America, as nearly every issue contained a picture of some of the parents. The magazine also published a grossly distorted history of World War II, apparently in recognition that the children had learned some of the truth. The BAYO article admitted, for instance, that an SS brigade known as the Belarus Legion had been formed, but it denied that the unit had gone into battle. The Ostrowsky government was portrayed as the culmination of centuries of Byelorussian striving for nationhood and independence. The BAYO article went to great lengths to place the blame for the killing of Jews in Byelorussia on Lithuanian mercenaries (some of whom did serve in Byelorussia). No mention was made of the Byelorussian mercenaries in the northern Ukraine, or of the police battalions who participated in the Einsatzgruppen “actions” against the Jews. The responsibility for the deaths of the civilian population was assigned to Soviet partisans. Selections from Nazi documents, complaining about the lack of support from the natives, were displayed as proof of Byelorussian innocence. No mention was made of the SS and Wehrmacht documents listing the collaborators and their roles in the extermination of the Jews. The BAYO article was a good example of the revisionist party line served up not only to the children of South River but to the equally naive intelligence community as well as the press.[6] By 1954, it was an open secret among American intelligence agencies that elements of some kind of former Byelorussian regime existed in America that had some kind of ties to the Nazis. In the middle of that year, Wisner funded an international convention of collaborators in South River that was called the Fourteenth Plenum of the Byelorussian Central Council.

Additional evidence of the collaborationist nature of the wartime Ostrowsky regime was provided by the publication in 1956 of Nicholas Vakar’s book Belorussia: The Making of a Nation.[7] It caused something of a sensation in the émigré community because it described, quite accurately, the role of the Byelorussian collaborators during the Nazi occupation and mentioned some by name. The Byelorussians denounced Vakar’s book, which, among its other offenses, accurately quoted some of the anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi speeches made at the Minsk collaborators’ convention of 1944. Ostrowsky’s son, Wiktor, published a pamphlet in London on anti-Semitism in Byelorussia that sought to lay a large measure of the blame on Jewish Communists and Russian repression, while mentioning very little about the actual existence of anti-Semitism among the Byelorussians themselves. The younger Ostrowsky concluded that “the local population took no part in these actions against the Jews.” Ironically, most of the Belarus settlements in America are located near large concentrations of Jews. Occasionally, allegations connecting the Byelorussians to war crimes were forwarded from the Jewish community to the FBI during the 1950s, but all the inquiries were dropped after only a cursory check.142 The Attorney General designated the institutions that qualifi ed, most of which were subsequently identifi ed as CIA front organizations. An applicant for citizenship was now able to leave the country without breaking his fi veyear waiting period. Individuals accorded special preference for immigration visas, reentry permits, and citizenship applications had small red cardboard fl ags stapled to their immigration paperwork. The red fl ag read simply “American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism” and gave a New York City address. Persons whose fi les were red-fl agged received special treatment. Minor discrepancies in their applications were overlooked; background investigations were cut short; paperwork was expedited. Most of the Byelorussian employees at Radio Liberty had red fl ags in their immigration fi les.143 The immigration offi cials knew that they were performing some kind of anticommunist propaganda or intelligence work and simply assumed that the CIA had already made a thorough background check. That is how Stanislaw Stankievich entered the United States and eventually became an American citizen, in spite of the fact that fi ve previous visa applications had been rejected. He was naturalized on March 8, 1969, by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.144 Stankievich gained his citizenship although he spent very little time in the United States.

Subject held many positions of trust in the German administration…. Also subject participated in the massacre of Polish offi cers in a forest near Minsk, and he was guilty of other war crimes. [Emphasis added.] For many of the late arrivals who emigrated during the 1950s and 1960s, a red fl ag in their fi les was not even necessary. The security staff at Radio Liberty in Munich was told by the OPC that certain persons were needed in the United States, and was instructed to take appropriate action. One staff member recalled in recent interviews that he hand-carried paperwork to the American consulate, where he was well known, in order to expedite visas. Later assigned to the New York headquarters of Radio Liberty, the same bewildered offi cer said that he was ordered in various cases to expedite everything from green cards to citizenship applications by personally escorting individuals through the immigration bureaucracy, relying mostly on his familiarity with local offi cials. Ironically, one Byelorussian Nazi – the CIC was convinced he was a Communist spy – was escorted through in just this fashion in order to work for Radio Liberty.

By the middle of the Eisenhower administration, the anti-Nazi faction in CIA had been all but neutered by their new masters in the OPC, with whom the CIA now shared its headquarters building, but little else. Wisner’s agents rarely shared their fi les with anyone else at the CIA, according to one offi cial, and they conducted themselves as an agency within the agency. To this day the CIA maintains that it is unable to locate all the OPC fi les.146 A classic example is the case of Mykola Lebed. Part of the CIA thought he was a benign CIA propagandist while OPC knew that he was an ex Nazi who ran an assassination program in the Ukraine. The Truman administration may have negligently allowed the Byelorussian Nazis into the United States, but it was the Eisenhower government that knowingly gave them citizenship. Between 1953 and 1958 those persons who had entered under the Displaced Persons Act began completing their fi ve-year waiting period. Once they were granted citizenship by the courts they would be virtually immune from deportation. But to attain citizenship the applicant had to undergo a full investigation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, including checks with the FBI and CIA. Moreover, the members of the Belarus network would have to disclose nearly every organization they had belonged to, every job they had ever held, every address at which they had resided, and swear to the truth of their statements before a federal judge. At fi rst, the Byelorussians were in a quandary. If they listed their membership in the SS or in the puppet government of Byelorussia, they would be ineligible for citizenship, not only because they had obtained their visas illegally but also because such membership was regarded as proof that the applicant lacked the “good moral character” required for American citizenship. If they omitted any mention of their wartime activities, their citizenship applications would be void for fraud. A very sophisticated compromise was reached. They would disclose the organizations to which they belonged but would omit identifying them as Nazi creations. Thus, their applications showed membership in the “Byelorussian Central Council” instead of the puppet government. Participation in the “White Ruthenian Committee in Warsaw” was listed, but it was not identifi ed as a recruiting organization for the Einsatzgruppen. They claimed their membership in the postwar “Byelorussian Central", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:165:cd61758be206", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4278, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "wartime activities, their citizenship applications would be void for fraud.

Participation in the “White Ruthenian Committee in Warsaw” was listed, but it was not identifi ed as a recruiting organization for the Einsatzgruppen. They claimed their membership in the postwar “Byelorussian Central Committee” or “Central Representation” but failed to mention that the CIC had considered it an “illegal organization” or that the Displaced Persons Commission had declared them “movements hostile” to the United States. For example, Emanuel Jasiuk, in his petition for naturalization, listed his memberships as the “Byelorussian-White Ruthenian Central Council” and the “Byelorussian-White Ruthenian Congress Committee.” Thus, the Byelorussians disclosed memberships in 1955 that would have prevented their emigrating to the United States in 1948. The Immigration Service noted several such discrepancies – particularly in the naturalization applications of Byelorussian émigrés – and became alarmed when the CIA’s Central Registry – still oblivious to OPC‘s recruitment drive – provided it with a wealth of derogatory information. But Immigration decided that it could not handle the investigations on its own, and turned to the FBI for help. The request created a problem for J. Edgar Hoover. If he disclosed the full extent of FBI knowledge to the Immigration Service, it would make clear the extent to which the bureau had permitted known Nazis to reside in the United States, and would eventually reveal that the FBI had been recruiting these same Nazis to provide information on Wisner’s activities. But if Hoover withheld the information entirely, he could be prosecuted for obstructing the Immigration Service. Hoover contacted the central offi ce of the Immigration Service in Washington and explained the delicate relationship between the Byelorussian Democratic Republic and the American Committee for Liberation. Moreover, he furnished the central offi ce with a copy of the sanitized fi eld investigation reports that he had submitted to the Justice Department several years earlier during the Foreign Agents Registration investigation. The report was a model of bureaucratic fence-siting; it confi rmed the AMCOMLIB connection and the anticommunist nature of the Belarus network, while archly mentioning unconfi rmed snippets of information hinting at World War II collaboration with the Germans. Copies of the FBI interviews with Kushel and Jasiuk were included with the report, but neither they nor the substance of Hoover’s conversation with the INS central offi ce was made known to the Brooklyn immigration offi ce until many years later.147 This “oversight” was fortunate for Kushel, because his lengthy summary of his collaboration with the Nazis fl atly contradicted the sworn statements that appeared on his citizenship application fi led in 1955.

He returned to Poland (and resided there) until July 1943 when he went to Germany where he resided in various cities until 1950. He was employed as a teacher in Poland and also as a farm worker. In Germany he was employed as a farm worker and as a factory worker, until 1945, when he became a camp leader of UNRRA camps at Regensburg and Michelsdorf, Germany. In October, 1948 he became a fi eld worker for the YMCA and was so employed until he departed for the United States….148 It was not possible to arrange a mere “oversight” where Jasiuk was concerned. He had already admitted falsifying his visa data to the FBI, and that alone should have barred his application for citizenship. There was only one thing for the FBI to do: the bureau concealed from the local immigration offi cer the fact that Jasiuk’s Nazi collaboration had been confi rmed by a number of reliable informants, and urged the Immigration Service to approve his citizenship application, simply because Jasiuk had been determined by the FBI to be “trustworthy.”150 The INS duly reported that: The Federal Bureau of Investigation was informed of the apparent false claims made by the subject. The subject, when fi rst interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claimed residence from 1940 until 1945 in a slave labor camp. During a second interview he admitted furnishing false information concerning his residence. Subsequent investigation revealed that the subject was trustworthy and that he had not collaborated with the Germans. The subject testifi ed before an offi cer of this Service in July 1955 that he had not collaborated with the Germans during World War II and that he had never worked for the German Secret Police…. The subject was naturalized as a citizen of the United States on November 16, 1956.151 Once the FBI had personally certifi ed Jasiuk as “trustworthy,” the INS saw no reason to disagree. After all, they were both branches of the Justice Department which had never raised any objections.

Moreover, attached to Jasiuk’s immigration paperwork was a special letter of character reference from the Stuttgart consulate: Jasiuk’s fi le also contained cryptic references to the fact that he had performed “highly confi dential work for an American agency.” It should be recalled that the central offi ce of the INS had been informed of the existence of the AMCOMLIB connection two years previously. In spite of all the Counter-Intelligence Corps could do to prevent it, even including personal warnings to Hoover that Jasiuk was a war criminal who had committed atrocities, the man had obtained his citizenship.153 So thoroughly had the FBI vouched for Jasiuk that the Immigration Service recruited him as its own confi dential informant. The Belarus network, experienced in the art of political maneuvering, went out of its way to ensnare as many American public offi cials as possible. At fi rst it was local politicians who were asked for endorsements, then the mayor of New York City and the governor of New York State, and members of Congress, with whom they had their pictures taken. Vice-President Richard M. Nixon received one Belarus leader in the White House – probably the only time a major war criminal has been so honored. [8] Belarus members even testifi ed before a special hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on July 15, 1953, to outline the struggle of the Byelorussian people for liberation from the Communists. A retired military offi cer working with AMCOMLIB introduced several prominent Byelorussian collaborators to Congress as “freedom fi ghters.” Among them were SS intelligence offi cers who had helped recruit advisers for the Einsatzgruppen. In the face of this deliberately orchestrated propaganda and public relations blitz, the Immigration Service did not challenge the decisions of the American intelligence community. The FBI began sending the INS copies of many of its Byelorussian fi eld reports to make it thoroughly aware of the true wartime role of the Byelorussians. From then on Hoover did not need to persuade the Immigration Service to cooperate in the cover-up; he could blackmail them. Among the documents provided the INS by the FBI was a sixty-threepage report, Byelorussian Activities in the New York Division.154 Before long the INS central offi ce knew virtually every facet of the Byelorussian collaboration with the Nazis, from the time of the creation of Ostrowsky’s government by the SS to the collapse of the Hitler regime.

Immigration offi cials in the local fi eld offi ces quickly caught on to the change in policy at the central offi ce. Between 1955 and 1956 several incriminating FBI fi les were released to local offi cials who were examining citizenship applications fi led by Byelorussian Nazi leaders. Instead of opening up the pro-Nazi leads, the offi cials noted that the FBI had determined that these applicants were trustworthy anti-communists, and approved the applications. Among them were two of the key advisers and recruiters for the Einsatzgruppen. In view of the bewildering complexity of the Belarus history and the strident anticommunism of the times, it is not diffi cult to imagine how the Immigration Service bureaucrats rationalized their rule-bending in the interests of national security. For the fi rst time, the Byelorussians had more than a promise of security in America. If they were ever prosecuted for fraudulently obtaining their citizenship, they would be in a position to threaten to expose high government offi cials in the Justice Department, FBI, CIA/ OPC, and INS who had made their fraud possible. The threat of blackmail was not limited to those few Byelorussians who actually worked with those intelligence agencies, since knowledge of the activities of the secret army was widespread in the émigré community. At most, only a handful of offi cials in the Immigration Service and the FBI were involved in the cover-up. Apart from a few isolated cases, like Mykola Lebed, where the Nazi connection was too obvious to be ignored, there is no evidence of any widespread corruption in either agency. The same cannot be said of the Justice Department itself, whose Internal security until monitored the Nazi activities and even approved their immigration under one of the intelligence legislation that gave special power to the Attorney General. The simple truth appears to be that bureaucratic incompetence and institutional ineffi ciency, unable to discern or penetrate the deliberate and elaborate fraud being perpetrated, enabled hundreds of ineligible applicants to obtain citizenship. For instance, the Army, in a request to the CIA for information on Kushel, noted that “he surrendered to the Germans,” suggesting that Kushel was an anti-Nazi.155 If the inquiry was sincere, it illustrates the Pentagon’s inability to extract information it already possessed from the intelligence archives of the various military services, which had thick dossiers on SS General Kushel. Perhaps the Army was testing to see how much the CIA knew about the Byelorussians.

Perhaps the Army was testing to see how much the CIA knew about the Byelorussians. It is fair to say that, after a comparison of the Top Secret archives of multiple agencies, the CIA was the most unwitting intelligence unit in America, at least when it came to Byelorussia. It is possible that not even OPC or Justice knew the extent to which the members of the Belarus network conspired to help each other obtain citizenship. Jasiuk once told immigration offi cials that while he was mayor of Stolpce, he had secretly resisted the Germans and helped save the life of a Jewish doctor named Greenberg. The story sounded so convincing that it was used by another Byelorussian, who did not even bother to change the name of the town or the name of the doctor. The two stories were solemnly sworn to by many of the same South River “character witnesses,” yet the Immigration Service apparently never caught on. Assured of their security, the enclaves of Byelorussian collaborators settled down in their new country. But they refused to give up the dream of returning to Byelorussia in triumph to revenge themselves upon the Soviets. In cellars and suitcases all across America the Belarus network had hidden the records of their wartime regime. They had smuggled their entire archives into the United States: everything from unit rosters of the Belarus Brigade to the minutes of the meetings of the Nazi puppet government. They had even brought some of the captured fi les that they had located for the SS as the Einsatzgruppen swept through Minsk. It may have been reckless to keep so many incriminating documents, but the Byelorussians would not part with these talismans.156 They were all that was left of their years of power under the Third Reich. Many years later, I sent an enterprising young French Jew, posing as a French Catholic, to interview the surviving “heroes” of the Belarus. They proudly dragged out fi le folders and photo catalogs of themselves, even in Nazi regalia. Apparently, they had no fear of being checked or searched at Ellis Island. [1] The State Department organized “national committees for liberation” for each Eastern European ethnic group, recruiting offi cials from the exile governments that Gustav Hilger had worked with in Berlin and bringing them to the United States (e.g., Top Secret State Department Decimal File for Albania, Declassifi ed Diplomatic Branch of the National Archives).

[2] The Americans had begun to suspect Philby before the British, when it was noticed that projects with which he was associated had a tendency to blow up. Believing that the CIA was on Donald Maclean’s trail rather than his own, Philby tipped him off, and Maclean and Guy Burgess, another mole, fl ed to the Soviet Union. After questioning, Philby was dismissed from the SIS, but conclusive evidence that he was a Soviet spy did not turn up until 1963. Philby got wind of it and defected to the Soviet Union. Another version of the story is that wiretaps on the British embassy strongly implicated Philby, but before conclusive evidence had been gathered, the CIA demanded in 1951 that the SIS recall him. Philby bluffed his British superiors with the admission that of course he had been giving information to the Soviets, he had been posing as a double agent for several years, with the full knowledge of the SIS. The British were convinced that their bumbling American cousins had made a mistake, and continued to employ Philby as an SIS agent in Turkey until, to their chagrin, he showed up at a 1963 press conference in Moscow. Philby probably did more damage to British-American intelligence relations after he came under suspicion than he ever achieved while his cover was still secure.

Kissinger had served with the 970th CIC unit in Germany, where his specialty was identifying Gestapo and SS offi cers hiding out among the civilian population.

Ostrowsky signed the letter as “President, Byelorussian Central Council.” The Times made no mention of the Nazi background of Ostrowsky or his government. It should be noted that the New York Times used its overseas bureaus as a cover for [8] When Richard Nixon was a naval offi cer, he was assigned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to review captured German fi nancial documents, some of which, according to legend,involved the Dulles brothers and their clients. The Dulles brothers promptly fi nanced Nixon’s fi rst run for Congress and then prevailed upon Eisenhower to take him on as Vice President. Australian intelligence records confi rmed that President Nixon used the eastern European Nazi vote as his ethnic counterweight to the Jewish vote for the Democrats in fi ve key states. This story is developed in some detail in J. Loftus and M. Aarons, The Secret War Against the Jews. Under the Eisenhower administration, the CIA/OPC’s covert activities expanded rapidly. After the end of the Korean War in 1953, the perception of the Soviet threat shifted from the military to the political, and there was a consequent increase in covert operations. Allen Dulles played a major part in defi ning this role. Dulles’s wartime experience in the OSS had been on the operational side of intelligence, and his fascination with undercover work persisted. Rolling back communism became the central theme of CIA operations, and Wisner’s shop scored successes against nationalist governments, as well: the overthrow of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 and the coup against President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in Guatemala a year later. Neither of them were communists, but their replacement was deemed necessary by Dulles corporate clients. These achievements gave the CIA and the administration a sense of confi dence and set the stage for future developments. Ever since the “Anti-Communist Manifesto” of the Doolittle report, the intelligence community had been waiting for a signal to begin making serious trouble for the Soviet Union, especially in the occupied countries of Eastern Europe.

Finally, on March 12, 1955, the National Security Council issued a directive to the CIA, entitled NSC 5412/1, which at last authorized Wisner to declare guerrilla war against the Communists: Specifi cally, such operations shall include any covert activities related to: propaganda, political action, economic warfare, preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition, escape and evasion and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states or groups including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups; support of indigenous and anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world; deception plans and operations and all compatible activities necessary to accomplish the foregoing.157 Of course the Constitution says only Congress has the power to declare war, but the little trifl e did not stop OPC. Armed with this mandate, Wisner determined to take “preventive direct action” against a number of Communist-bloc nations that he believed were ripe for revolt. He authorized an operation designed to incite simultaneous revolts against Soviet authority in each of the major cities of Eastern Europe, which were to be followed by a civil war among the ethnic and religious minorities within the Soviet Union. Once the revolt had erupted, underground cells were to seize the government buildings and radio, and call for the people to rise up. Within hours, Wisner’s “liberation armies” would be dropped in to attack the scattered Soviet garrisons.158 Roads, bridges, and rail lines would be blown up or blocked to prevent the movement of Russian reinforcements. After the Soviets had been suffi ciently weakened, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops would be dispatched as a peacekeeping force, with the declaration that they would remain only long enough to restore order and conduct the democratic elections that Stalin had promised at Yalta in 1945. Wisner began pouring millions of dollars into training dissident Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Byelorussians, Latvians, and Romanians to be the spearhead of the operation. Underground resistance networks were to be reestablished, training areas and bases for guerrilla bands opened on the periphery of the Iron Curtain, and arms caches built up. A few years before, as relations with the Russians soured, President Truman had ordered a study prepared for an invasion of the Soviet Union. A review of the study shows that invasion routes had been planned and a timetable set for the early 1950s. Wisner’s plan to use proxy underground armies of ex-Nazis was in a sense more sophisticated than Truman’s, which relied heavily on the use of American combat forces to capture strategic targets long enough for the anticipated revolts to gain momentum.

Nevertheless, Wisner’s plan was romantic and absurdly impractical. In order for it to have any chance for success two elements were indispensable: complete secrecy in preparation and complete coordination of attack. Not only would Wisner have to train, arm, and equip resistance forces in secret, but he would need to orchestrate each of the internal rebellions so they would culminate at the same time. And secrecy had already been lost, for Gehlen’s organization – which would supply the core of the groups being recruited – had been penetrated by Communist agents who reported to Moscow every facet of the plan. For example, Gehlen’s liaison to NATO headquarters, Heinz Felfe, turned out to be a Soviet mole. A ranking Pentagon offi cial who personally briefed Felfe acknowledged in a recent interview that there was not a secret in the entire NATO archives to which Felfe did not have access, including the plans for Wisner’s operation.159 Felfe had been brought to the United States for consultation, but because of his Nazi past he could not be issued a regular visa. This was no obstacle for Wisner. According to Felfe’s “blue fi le” at Fort Meade, a false background was created for him and he was issued false documentation. Felfe’s KGB controllers must have been amused at the efforts made by Wisner to circumvent the laws of his own country to smuggle a Soviet mole into the United States. The blame for the tragic dénouement of the plan should not rest with Wisner alone. During the Eisenhower administration, “no direct action covert operations were initiated without prior White House approval,” according to a high-ranking CIA offi cer.160 The President himself had diffi culty in presenting cover stories to the press and generally preferred not to know about Wisner’s cover operations.161 Instead, a special group, the Operations Coordination Board – which came to be known as the “Twenty Committee” – was created to oversee these operations and to serve as a “circuit breaker” so that the President could disavow direct knowledge of such activities. In 1954 Nelson Rockefeller succeeded C. D. Jackson, a former Time, Inc. executive, as “super-coordinator” for clandestine intelligence operations, with the title of Special Assistant to the President for Cold War Strategy.

Rockefeller must have known of Wisner’s plan, for he received a “family jewels” briefi ng from Dulles and Wisner apprising him of all covert operations run by the OPC. Moreover, as a confi rmed Cold Warrior, he had previously allowed the Rockefeller Fund to serve as a conduit for OPC money. And of course, Rockefeller had all those troubling Nazi investments lurking in his past. Giving aid and comfort to the enemy in time of war was treason, and the Rockefellers were arguably the most guilty of all the American families who fi nanced Hitler. Rockefeller left the administration at the end of 1955 as a result of political infi ghting, and Vice President Richard M. Nixon replaced him as the President’s Cold War strategist. Nixon had a small boy’s delight in the arcane tools of the intelligence craft – the hidden microphones, the “black” propaganda, the techniques of interrogation – and Dulles and Wisner were pleased to gratify his curiosity. Like Rockefeller, Nixon received a deep briefi ng on OPC operations, and Wisner personally escorted him to the training center in Virginia where the Special Forces were being trained.162 On June 28, 1956, riots broke out in Poznan, Poland, and were brutally put down by the Russians. Across America there were demands that the United States “do something” to help the embattled Poles in their fi ght for freedom. Considerable pressure was brought to bear upon Wisner to order his forces into action, but he convinced the Twenty Committee that his plan was not yet ready. Over the next few months he worked at a furious pace to have the operation ready by the middle of 1958. But revolt erupted in Hungary in late October 1956. With only small arms and homemade bombs, youthful rebels drove out the offi cials of the Communist government and proclaimed Hungary a free nation, neutral between East and West. There is no evidence that OPC provoked the uprising, but Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty created the hope of American support. [As discussed in our later books, a Russian ex-Nazi double agent broadcast the OPC uprising codes on his own radio transmitter which had a similar frequency. ] The situation was complicated by an Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt to seize control of the Suez Canal, which had been expropriated by the Egyptians. The Eisenhower administration opposed the Suez adventure, and on November 4, Premier Nikita S.

Peoples of the world! Hear the call for help of a small nation! … This is Radio Rakoczi, Hungary … Radio Free Europe, Munich! Radio Free Europe, Munich! Answer! Have you received our transmission?” Wisner, who had been on a tour of OPC stations in Europe, was in Vienna as these appeals for help poured in. At the fi rst reports of the uprising he had been in a state of euphoria, expecting the revolt to spread to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. He pleaded with Washington for an airlift of arms and reinforcements for the Hungarians – only to be ignored. Rage boiling over, he cursed the British, French, and Israelis, claiming their attack on Egypt had provided the Russians with a cover for intervention in Hungary.[1] There was to be no help for the Hungarians. The shock of the Soviet counterattack had stunned the Eisenhower administration. The Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out that not even an incursion of the Special Forces would be enough to save Budapest. Only an airlift of weapons could stave off defeat, and that would mean the use of military aircraft and open American intervention. This might lead to war with the Soviet Union – a war, the military pointed out, for which the United States was unprepared.164 So no relief was sent to the Hungarians. Before the fi ghting ended in Budapest, as many as 30,000 people may have been killed, and another 200,000 fl ed the country. “Poor fellows, poor fellows,” lamented Eisenhower. “I think about them all the time. I wish there was some way of helping them.”165 General Lucian K. Truscott was assigned by President Eisenhower to investigate Wisner’s operation.166 He went fi rst to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, the site of a hastily established reception center for Hungarian refugees, and was disturbed by what he learned. Wisner’s agents had led the Hungarians to believe that direct American military intervention would take place once the revolt had started. Truscott also discovered that despite the disaster in Hungary, Wisner was pressing ahead with his plan for Czechoslovakia with the same hope of inciting or assisting a mass uprising.

The general succeeded in persuading the President that the outcome would be equally disastrous, and orders were given to close down Wisner’s operation and disperse the agents involved. Upon his return to Washington, Wisner began to act erratically. He told long, pointless stories at conferences and drank more heavily than usual. A worried Polly Wisner told friends that she had seen her husband take out his pistol and talk to it. Not long afterward, Wisner was hospitalized with nervous exhaustion and hepatitis, apparently picked up in Athens from a plate of tainted clams. Over the next few years, Wisner suffered several nervous breakdowns; in 1965 he killed himself with a 20-gauge shotgun on his Maryland farm.167 Kim Philby said he was told by a mutual friend that Wisner had committed suicide because of his disappointment over the outcome of the Hungarian uprising.168 Friends and associates described Wisner as a man who had given his life in the service of his country. “At the very outset of this country’s unforeseen and unprepared role as a major power of the world, he was called upon to break new ground of the most dangerous, and for a major power, the most essential ground,” they said in a statement issued at the time of his death. “In fact, he had to meet the long prepared challenge of the vast Stalinist intelligence and subversion net. Thereafter, for about a decade, he devoted himself totally to one of the most onerous and diffi cult tasks any American public servant has ever had to undertake…. What never can be broken is the image of Frank Wisner left with those who worked with him. He was brave yet wise, prudent yet strongly determined, and deeply American above all….”169 Many years later, one of the men who had succeeded Wisner as DDP[2] assessed the net results of OPC’s programs. Apart from East Germany, he said, OPC did not have even the basic elements of an intelligence system in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. There was no network of safe houses, not even a reliable system of couriers. Before he left his post as head of CIA covert operations, Wisner must have realized how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his Nazi protégés. Whether out of embarrassment or anger, he did not brief his successors in DDP on the State Department-Nazi connection.

The CIA, however, continued to use Wisner’s old contacts, in utter ignorance of their Nazi backgrounds. In one case, the agency even considered granting a Byelorussian Nazi permanent sanctuary under the Hundred Persons Act, in the belief that he had worked with the Resistance in France, and had been imprisoned by the Gestapo. He was still considered to have been a reliable agent until the CIA was shown a copy of his Gestapo fi le in the National Archives. All along he had worked for the SS as an intelligence agent until it discovered his extensive communist background and demoted him. Wisner was not even effi cient at smuggling Nazis. With the disbanding of the few remaining cadres of Wisner’s secret army, the Special Forces were taken over by the Army and became the nucleus of the Green Berets.[3] The Byelorussian collaborators he had helped come to America faced diffi cult times. The CIA fi nally realized it had never possessed an organized underground behind the Iron Curtain. Most of the agency’s so-called intelligence sources were merely “paper mills,” producing scraps of information that had been doctored up to be traded to the gullible Americans in exchange for survival.170 And by concealing the extent of Soviet penetration within their own ranks, the émigrés had helped delude Wisner into believing they could carry on covert operations in secrecy. Now their CIA subsidies were cut off, and there was even talk of scrapping Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, which had provided jobs for many of them.[4] In the years following the collapse of Wisner’s operations, the Soviets continued to monitor the activities of the Belarus network in America. Soviet offi cials from the offi cial Byelorussian UN delegation even met with Belarus leaders in New York City.171 Some collaborators contacted the Soviet embassy, asking for transcripts of their school records in Byelorussia. Three or four wrote to Byelorussia and brought over mailorder brides, all of whom professed to unhappiness in America and quickly returned home. The Nazis in America knew what the CIA did not, that the Russian intelligence service already knew all about their activities and places of residence.

The Russians possessed the knowledge to blackmail the Nazis in America at will. The Americans did not even know where Wisner had hidden the Nazis.] The Soviet Union embassy staff collected books and magazines written by members of the Belarus network, and criticized them as collaborators in internal Soviet publications. But the Soviets did not repeat the denunciations made in front of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 that large numbers of infamous war criminals were being sheltered by Americans. The silence ended in 1961, when Franz Kushel and Emanuel Jasiuk were singled out for special attention. The accusations against them surfaced in a Yiddish-language newspaper, the Morning Freiheit, published in New York.172 Basically, the paper reprinted several accounts of the trials in the Soviet Union of those who had participated in the atrocities at the Koldichevo death camp in Byelorussia. Jasiuk and Kushel were named as key offi cials in the Nazi administration that had sent thousands of people to their deaths in the camp. Earlier on, when similar accusations had been made, the FBI had consulted Simon Wiesenthal, the noted Nazi hunter, who had warned that the charges might be a Communist Cold War tactic to intimidate the émigré community with false charges of war crimes.173 Since this was precisely what the FBI wanted to hear, the earlier probes were dropped. But this time the charges had come to the attention of survivors of the Holocaust, who refused to ignore them. There was also a great deal of pressure from Congress, and in 1962 the Immigration and Naturalization Service launched an investigation. Once again, the INS turned to the FBI for assistance. It was a case of one wing of the Justice Department hunting Nazis, while the other wing protected them. The FBI had known the entire history of the Byelorussian Nazi government since the early 1950s and realized that Kushel and Jasiuk were two of the most important war criminals in the United States. The Bureau also was aware that both men had ties to OPC through the American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism, which funded their activities. So, citing Wiesenthal’s unfortunate comment, the FBI reported to the Immigration Service that the Soviet charges were part of a plot to discredit important anticommunist political fi gures in the United States. Occasionally, an enterprising newspaper reporter would try to dig into the story. One even managed to interview Kushel, who denied having served with the Einsatzgruppen before slamming the door in the reporter’s face.

One even managed to interview Kushel, who denied having served with the Einsatzgruppen before slamming the door in the reporter’s face. Similarly, when one Byelorussian in South River began receiving anonymous letters denouncing him as a war criminal, he wrote to the FBI asking for assistance in identifying his accuser. To understand the confi dence behind such a gesture and the presumption that such assistance would be forthcoming, it should be noted that the charges were accurate.174 The Immigration Service did not rest on the assurances of the FBI, as it had before, however. INS offi cials called the U.S. Army’s Investigative Records Repository at Fort Meade, Maryland, and asked if the CIC had any information on Kushel. The CIC, it will be recalled, possessed several classifi ed dossiers dating back to the late 1940s that positively identifi ed him as an SS offi cer, a member of the Nazi government of Byelorussia, and an informant for SS intelligence. But something had changed at CIC. After a telephone call from CIC in 1963 the Immigration Service noted in its records: Mr. Woolwine advised that the CIC records … show that Franzishek Kushel was the leader of the Michelsdorf Displaced Persons Camp. No additional information relating to Franzishek Kushel is contained in the CIC Records. In view of this information, Mr. Woolwine was advised that formal report would not be required. And so, the sanitizing continued. The Pentagon had reason to be grateful that it did not have to submit a formal report on Kushel to the Immigration Service. The agency had previous experience with putting Kushel’s false background in writing. In 1956 it had furnished CIA/OSO with a sanitized version of Kushel’s history. Undeceived, the CIA had responded with a summary of the hodgepodge of erroneous information concerning Kushel’s anticommunist activities, but did note that he had been in fact some sort of SS division commander, as the CIC’s own records showed. It will be recalled that the FBI had alerted the Immigration Service to Kushel’s CIA fi le when he applied for citizenship in 1955, but through “oversight,” the records were never checked.175 In 1963 the CIA informed the INS that it had “no derogatory information” on Kushel, but included a copy of its 1956 report mentioning the ambiguous reference to the SS division, as well as the fact that the CIC possessed “voluminous information” on Kushel.176 The Immigration Service should have realized that the CIA’s allegations about Kushel’s SS background dovetailed rather neatly with the recent war crimes charges, and it should have gone back to CIC with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:180:cf6054a2f220", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4293, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 181, "text": "records were never checked.175 In 1963 the CIA informed the INS that it had “no derogatory information” on Kushel, but included a copy of its 1956 report mentioning the ambiguous reference to the SS division, as well as the fact that the CIC possessed “voluminous information” on Kushel.176 The Immigration Service should have realized that the CIA’s allegations about Kushel’s SS background dovetailed rather neatly with the recent war crimes charges, and it should have gone back to CIC with a demand that the earlier, unsanitized fi les be produced and the leads followed up. But through incompetence or conspiracy, these leads were never pursued. The Kushel investigation was terminated almost immediately after the CIA reported that it had “no derogatory information” on him.177 Recently a CIA offi cial was asked to defi ne “no derogatory information.” He responded that it meant there was no evidence of pro-communist activity. Nazism was regarded as anticommunist, therefore information that a person was a Nazi was not derogatory. This was not simply doublespeak; the intelligence community has a precise language all its own, refl ecting carefully constructed compartmentalization to conceal organizational connections. For example, if the CIA were asked whether it ever employed Nazis as agents, the agency would respond in the negative. Upon further inquiry, if a researcher knew enough to ask, he would discover that “employee” does not include someone employed by a CIA front organization; and “agents” do not include persons who worked for Wisner’s guerrilla forces, because they were not on the United States government payroll. To a layman it may seem like a distinction without a difference, since they were all paid by the CIA to do work for the CIA. The FBI employs similar distinctions. If the Bureau were asked whether it ever used Nazis as informants, the answer would be “no.” The FBI distinguishes between confi dential sources, casual sources, volunteers who provide information, and people who provide information under investigation. Since the FBI refuses to release the names of its confi dential informants even to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, it has normally been impossible to determine whether the Bureau has had a confl ict of interest in conducting war crimes investigations. Even though the temporary “Sunrise” visas for intelligence agents are granted by the Attorney General, the FBI keeps control of the records. Mssrs.

The Pentagon could not even fi nd the name of the offi ce within Military Intelligence that coordinated its old Sensitive Document fi les. As the World War II-era clerks retired from government service during the late 1960s and 1970s, they took with them the institutional memory of Top Secret operations that had been conducted only twenty years previously. With some chagrin, a CIA offi cial has confi ded that the institutional memory in one section of the agency went back only eighteen months due to the wave of recent retirements. In fact, each American intelligence agency carefully maintains acres and acres of cavernous vaults under heavy guard without the remotest idea of their contents. In the wake of Watergate and other abuses – including CIA involvement in an “anticommunist” coup in Chile that recalled Frank Wisner in his heyday – there were demands for a congressional investigation. President Gerald Ford, who had succeeded Nixon, issued an executive order establishing a presidential commission to investigate the CIA. Nelson Rockefeller, then Vice President, was named to head it, and knowledgeable observers compared the appointment to sending in the fox to guard the henhouse because of Rockefeller’s links to the intelligence community and his knowledge of its covert activities. A subsequent Senate investigation concluded that the Rockefeller Commission was only a whitewash effort to divert further investigation from abuses by the intelligence community. The existence of the Rockefeller Commission did not noticeably assuage Congress’s urge to investigate, however. On January 27, 1975, the Senate established a Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, under the chairmanship of Senator Frank Church of Idaho. The Church Committee’s mandate included: The extent to which the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and any other federal law-enforcement or intelligence agencies coordinate their respective activities, and agreements which govern that coordination, and the extent to which a lack of coordination has contributed to activities which are illegal, improper, ineffi cient, unethical, or contrary to the intent of Congress…. The extent and necessity of overt and covert intelligence activities in the United States.178 The committee soon discovered the existence of OPC, the original clandestine service, and was just starting to penetrate the labyrinth of OPC cryptonyms when Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens, was assassinated.

The Church Committee was falsely blamed for inadvertently disclosing Welch’s identity and thus causing his death. The resulting furor over what was perceived as a reckless investigation contributed to the disbandment of the committee just as it was about to start probing into the Belarus secret and the other Nazi networks that had been smuggled into America at Wisner’s direction. In hindsight, it appears that the Church Committee was the victim of false propaganda: subsequent investigations have shown that neither Welch nor his predecessor in Athens had ever concealed their position as CIA station chief. But whether by accident or by design, the investigation was terminated.[5] Wisner’s OPC project fi les remain buried in the vaults. The Church Committee did (like the Rockefeller Commission) recommend the establishment of a joint congressional oversight committee.179 Paradoxically, right across the street from the Senate lay enough information to expose not only the Belarus secret but virtually the entire range of OPC’s illegal activities. The Library of Congress had obtained copies of several books published by the Byelorussian Soviet Republic in the late 1960s that described in detail the wartime collaboration of the Belarus, the atrocities its members had committed, and their subsequent involvement with the CIA and the British secret service. One book, Collaborators in Crime, displayed photographs of captured Byelorussian paratroopers with their U.S. government-issue equipment.180 The book also reproduced many of the Nazi documents incriminating the Belarus political leaders, and named their supervisors in Radio Liberty, and identifi ed the Eisenhower administration offi cials who had hired them and smuggled them to America. Other books recently published in Byelorussia display photos of the various collaborators, including Franz Kushel, in full Nazi uniform.181 These volumes had never been translated into English, and none of the accusatory information on the library’s open shelves had been discovered by any of the intelligence agencies until I came across them while working for OSI. Moreover, the Library of Congress also contained suffi cient information to sustain many of the Soviet charges against the Byelorussian collaborators. Books published by the Belarus network in the Byelorussian language contain photographs of the leaders, including Kushel, Jasiuk, Sobolewsky, and many others. Even the sanitized Nazi documents reprinted by the Belarus network itself confi rmed the Soviet accounts in nearly every respect, including admissions that they were being funded by AMCOMLIB, whose name was later changed to Radio Liberty.

The Slavic Reading Room at the Library of Congress has copies of various other Byelorussian publications, including those in which the various factions accused each other of war crimes and secret collaboration with the Communists. The library’s microfi lm section contains copies of the Minsker Zeitung,182 the Nazi newspaper published in Minsk during the occupation, which names and discusses the roles of the various collaborators. In the stack sections under “White Russian History” are various eyewitness accounts by the Jewish victims of the Byelorussian holocaust, describing in detail the atrocities committed by the Byelorussian collaborators and the police battalions during the war. A few blocks away from the Senate, in the Modern Military Section of the National Archives, repose microfi lms of the Third Reich’s wartime records for Byelorussia. The weekly SS reports named their key collaborators and reported the total number of Jews killed. The Wehrmacht reports discussed the role of the political collaborators in forming the police battalions to suppress the partisans. There is even an old OPC card index to the Nazi documents (from which the names of its agents had been removed) that could facilitate a search for a particular individual. A general index to each country had already been prepared by one of OPC‘s research fronts. The index contains such topics for Nazi documents as “Collaborators Civilian,” “Atrocities,” “Jews,” and “Anti-Partisan Operations.” There was only one problem: There had never been funds to translate the materials, and so they lay there while various congressional investigating committees searched for proof of illegal activity in the intelligence community. Once again, these incriminating documents remain untranslated until I hired a team of German speaking college students as part of OSI’s Belarus Project. It was not necessary to search the Library of Congress or the National Archives if one had access to a security agency. In 1977, for example, when the new head of Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe took over, he was puzzled by the frequent charges in the Soviet press that many of his staff members were war criminals. When he started receiving reports that these same staff members were having diffi culties with Jewish employees, he became alarmed. He went to pull their personnel records, only to be informed that the CIA had removed them when custody of Radio Liberty was returned to the State Department.

A list of suspected Nazis among the employees of Radio Liberty – including Stanislaw Stankievich – was submitted to State Department security, with the request to conduct a thorough background check. Security offi cers contacted virtually every intelligence agency in NATO and reported the initial raw results. Most of the names were connected to various uncorroborated accusations, but in Stankievich’s case, agency after agency had listed him as a former Nazi who had committed dreadful atrocities in Borissow. Stankievich had recently retired, however, and instead of continuing the investigation, Radio Liberty quietly let the matter drop. But others in Washington were not so content. In 1977, Representative Joshua Eilberg, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization, and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman were convinced that there was something to the persistent rumors about Nazi war criminals residing in the United States.183 Together they collected a list of some forty-four names which were submitted to various federal agencies. For the fi rst time, the Department of Defense was faced with a specifi c request by a member of Congress for information on war criminals. Among the names was that of Emanuel Jasiuk. Although one letter of his name was mistyped,[6] that should not have hindered the Pentagon’s computerized fi les entry program, which searched out names spelled 75 percent the same. A phone call to the Defense Investigative Service was all that was needed to disclose that the Army CIC possessed a dossier on Jasiuk. In fact, the CIC dossier on Jasiuk in its Top Secret “blue fi les,” or “Special Documents Division,” contained a number of documents from different agencies discussing everything from Jasiuk‘s war crimes to his postwar service as an intelligence informant. As mentioned earlier, it included a discussion of the decision by the consular offi cials in Stuttgart to condone the fraudulent statements in his visa application. All of this information was on fi le prior to Jasiuk’s obtaining citizenship. There was also another Jasiuk dossier in the Pentagon – an Air Force fi le that was equally explosive. In it was a copy of the 1950 CIC correspondence with J. Edgar Hoover exposing Jasiuk as a war criminal who had fraudulently entered the United States after working for Air Force intelligence. It would have led Congress straight to the FBI’s involvement in the cover-up.

This entry indicates that the Army Investigative Records Repository (AIRR) at Fort Meade had a dossier discussing a subject of investigation named Emanuel Jasiuk who was born on August 19, 1906, in Poland. Since both the Army and the Air Force dossiers cross-referenced each other, if either one had run a name trace on its own manual index, or on the Pentagon’s computer index, every Jasiuk dossier would have been instantly located. In order not to fi nd any Jasiuk dossiers, two intelligence clerks in two separate military agencies would have had to make the same series of errors simultaneously. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, with the cooperation of the Department of State, is presently compiling evidence on alleged Nazi war criminals who entered the United States fraudulently…. For the past two years I have been following closely the action being taken by the Service in these cases. Certain allegations have emerged which lead me and some of my colleagues to believe that the existence and backgrounds of these individuals were known to the Service for a long time without any action having been taken. These people entered the United States and acquired benefi ts under the Immigration and Nationality Act in contravention of United States law. No adequate explanation has been forthcoming from the Service as to why they did not proceed against these individuals until Congress brought the matter to their attention. I would like to enlist the cooperation of the General Accounting Offi ce in conducting a thorough investigation of this situation, especially to determine if Immigration personnel deliberately obstructed active prosecution of these cases or engaged in a conspiracy to withhold or quash any information in its possession. As the audit-and-inspection branch of the government, the GAO was accustomed to dealing with bureaucratic feints. It examined a number of Immigration and Naturalization Service fi les for allegations of war crimes, winnowed the list down to 111 names, including both Kushel and Jasiuk, and prepared to resubmit it to the Defense Department.186 In order to avoid any confusion over misspellings or insuffi cient identifying data, the GAO asked INS to list every alternate spelling found in its fi les, along with the date and place of each person’s birth. Each of the GAO’s spellings of names for Kushel and Jasiuk was an exact match of a dossier name listed in the CIC and Air Force repositories.187 In fact, on October 7, 1977 David Crossland, General Counsel of INS, notifi ed GAO that Immigration had found a CIC dossier for Jasiuk, but that GAO would have to wait", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:186:7406a63b57c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4299, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 187, "text": "asked INS to list every alternate spelling found in its fi les, along with the date and place of each person’s birth.

Apparently, DOD realized that it had previously told Congressman Eilberg that no such fi le existed. Subsequently, Defense’s response was relayed to INS, for the note bears a distinct alteration. Someone had drawn a pencil line through that part about “until notifi ed” so that the fi nal note now read: “Defense material NOT cleared for review by GAO.” No future disclosure was contemplated. At the same time, the FBI sanitized its reports in Jasiuk’s immigration fi le by blacking out any mention that Jasiuk had ever worked for State Department or Military Intelligence. The usual procedure is to coordinate with the third agency before attempting such deletions. So again, in 1977 DOD was apparently notifi ed that there was CIC information in Jasiuk’s immigration fi le. Nevertheless, when DOD offi cials met with the GAO investigators in April 1978, they stated that it would be unnecessary to recheck Jasiuk’s fi le since they had already done that for Eilberg, and no such fi le could be found. When the GAO fi nally saw Jasiuk’s immigration fi le, all the incriminating information linking him with intelligence operations had been removed. The GAO read the FBI’s sanitized discussion of a previous CIC investigation, and concluded that this must have been the report that Crossland had mentioned earlier. There was no indication in the fi le that any documents had been removed, and, as if to reassure the investigators, they immediately received a note from DOD: The GAO did not learn about this note or the missing DOD documents until October 1980, when I showed them the unexpurgated fi le. Nor was the Department of Defense the only agency to withhold information. The FBI, the Central Offi ce of the INS, the State Department, and the CIA all had their own dossiers on Jasiuk – containing everything from the CIC’s letter to J. Edgar Hoover denouncing Jasiuk as a war criminal working for the Air Force, to the High Commissioner’s letter to the State Department reminding State how it had smuggled Jasiuk in.

Edgar Hoover denouncing Jasiuk as a war criminal working for the Air Force, to the High Commissioner’s letter to the State Department reminding State how it had smuggled Jasiuk in. The CIC had copies of letters from Jasiuk recruiting other war criminals for the State Department, including his cousin Dimitri Kasmowich, whom Jasiuk identifi ed as a former Nazi police chief in Byelorussia. There were CIC reports criticizing State Department offi cials who intervened to help Kasmowich avoid CIC prosecution. In all, there were about a dozen copies of various Jasiuk dossiers in the possession of the intelligence community in 1978. Despite the fact that GAO asked for them from each agency, using the correct spelling of Jasiuk’s name, none of the dossiers was disclosed. The only information the GAO saw was an FBI report claiming that there was no information showing Jasiuk to be a Nazi war criminal, and that, in any event, he was determined to be “trustworthy” and a good anticommunist by the FBI after a thorough investigation – hardly grounds for suspicion by the GAO.[8] Far more incriminating is the response of DOD to the GAO request for dossiers on Kushel. This time there is no doubt that DOD forwarded Kushel’s name to CIC.188 There were no misspellings that could be used to evade a charge of obstruction of Congress.189 On April 29, 1979 the CIC sent the following letter to the Pentagon to report the results of their search for a Kushel dossier: In accordance with above reference, an intensive search of the records maintained at the Investigative Records Repository (IRR) USAIN-SCOM, was conducted. Checks were accomplished with the Defense Central Index (DIS); Name Only Index, IRR, Special Records Division, IRR, and the Microfi lm Branch, IRR…. The results of this search represent an exhaustive check of the IRR conducted on the basis of the information provided.190 The Department of Defense told the GAO it had located a fi le for Kushel, but that it contained no derogatory information.191 In fact, the only fi le mentioned was the sanitized version supplied to the CIA back in 1956, which included just a two-page character reference letter, designed to show that the military had no contact with Kushel until the mid-1950s.192 Yet the CIC had several fi les on Kushel, under the exact spellings furnished by GAO and exactly where the CIC claimed to have conducted its “exhaustive search.”193 In fact, Kushel was such a prominent Nazi that he was twice indexed as far back as the 1948 Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual which listed him as the president", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:188:72d61ff41d52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4301, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 189, "text": "which included just a two-page character reference letter, designed to show that the military had no contact with Kushel until the mid-1950s.192 Yet the CIC had several fi les on Kushel, under the exact spellings furnished by GAO and exactly where the CIC claimed to have conducted its “exhaustive search.”193 In fact, Kushel was such a prominent Nazi that he was twice indexed as far back as the 1948 Consolidated Orientation and Guidance Manual which listed him as the president of the “ZBW,” an underground organization of “White Russian War Veterans in Exile.” The CIC described Kushel’s ZBW as a unit of the “right-wing Kriwiczy party” whose members had collaborated in the “puppet government of White Russia,” in which “Oberstleutnant Franz Kushel” was the Minister of Defense. In 1948 the Army fi les also listed Kushel’s military history: Even assuming that no one in the Pentagon or the CIC had consulted this Top Secret reference book in 1978 (which was possible), the CIC had several complete personal background dossiers each fi led under alternative spellings of Kushel’s name, so there was no possibility of missing any of the fi les the GAO requested. The individual dossiers in the Investigative Records Repository at Fort Meade included everything from Kushel’s affi liation with the SD (the SS intelligence service) $\\underline { { 1 9 4 } }$ to his participation in the Nazi government.195 Moreover, the cross-references in either of Kushel’s personal background dossiers would have led the GAO straight to the thousands of documents which the CIC had compiled on the Belarus network.196 In fact, the crossreferences indicated that there had once been a third personal background dossier on Kushel (not counting the sanitized fi le) in the Top Secret vault, a dossier that no one now could fi nd.197 Apparently, Kushel’s principal fi le was destroyed at about the same time that other agencies were destroying theirs according to a “routine purge” in 1962 which coincidentally was the last time Kushel was under investigation for war crimes. One of the interesting things about intelligence fi les is that they are so extensively cross-referenced that it is almost impossible to destroy them completely. Copies always exist in another agency, or even in another fi le within the same agency. For example, Jasiuk’s CIC fi le contained copies of the letter to Hoover, and so did the Air Force fi le, either of which showed that he was a wanted war criminal.198 In 1979, I requested Kushel’s dossiers from the same agencies that told GAO in 1978 that they had furnished all pertinent information. One agency, the CIA, reported to OSI (Offi ce of Special Investigations) in 1979 that it had no dossiers for Kushel or any of the other Byelorussian Nazis on my list, but when I went back in 1980 with proof from other agencies that the CIA dossiers existed,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:189:88eebd3fbb27", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4302, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "of which showed that he was a wanted war criminal.198 In 1979, I requested Kushel’s dossiers from the same agencies that told GAO in 1978 that they had furnished all pertinent information.

The new CIA memo was dated in 1979 and explicitly referenced my 1979 request. Like the GAO, I had hit a roadblock. [9] Someone had found the Nazi fi les I had requested, but never turned them over to the Justice Department. With the fi rm support of OSI in 1980 (while the Democrats were still in power), the roadblocks inside the CIA began to vanish, and the fi les on Kushel began to appear. One document listed Kushel as a source for Wisner’s OPC, another that he had been working for American intelligence since 1948 – a year before he emigrated. Another contained an interview with Kushel that fl atly contradicted the information on his citizenship application. And another showed that Kushel was the leader of a group being funded by AMCOMLIB, the OPC front group that later became Radio Liberty. In all, there were nearly a dozen incriminating documents on Kushel’s Nazi background in fi ve different intelligence agencies. However, the only materials shown to GAO were sanitized fi le summaries asserting that there was no derogatory information available on Franz Kushel. The GAO only saw fi les to the effect that Kushel was some sort of Polish freedom-fi ghter who had once worked in the military wing of the SS against the Communists, which in itself would not even have barred him from citizenship. There are only two possibilities: either fi ve separate branches of the intelligence community were stricken with simultaneous amnesia in 1978 so that they all inadvertently overlooked nearly two dozen incriminating dossiers indexed exactly as GAO requested, or a small group of individuals who knew how to protect their key informants (and themselves) sanitized, concealed, and manipulated their records so that the Belarus secret would never be made public. On May 15, 1978 the GAO released its report to Congress entitled “Widespread Conspiracy to Obstruct Probes of Alleged Nazi War Criminals Not Supported by Available Evidence.” The report concluded that the GAO had conducted an extensive search of all the intelligence agencies’ fi les, and of the twenty-nine background dossiers that were discovered – including one innocuous fi le for Kushel – but that none of the documents had indicated any derogatory information.

Stymied for lack of evidence, the subcommittee terminated its inquiry. Kushel had died before the inquiry began. But a year or so after the GAO investigation, the Immigration Service was asked to determine whether Emanuel Jasiuk was still alive. The local investigator contacted his most reliable informant in South River. Mrs. Jasiuk informed him that her husband had died. [1] According to one intelligence offi cial, Wisner was never the same after the abortive uprising. In his opinion, the Hungarian episode did not itself shatter Wisner, but it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Years of effort in fi ghting the Communists had taken their toll. Wisner became a manic depressive – up when OPC was moving against the Communists, down when his networks were eliminated. James Forrestal, one of Wisner’s original patrons, is said to have experienced a similar end. According to Charles Higham, who researched this period, nurses found Forrestal lying on the fl oor of his hospital room, babbling that the Communists and the Jews were trying to kill him. Shortly afterward, he committed suicide with a cryptic note concerning the Nazi code word “Nightingale”, which referred to the use of Byelorussian and Ukrainian intelligence guides in the 1941 attack on the Soviet Union. [4] The CIA continued to fi nance Radio Free Europe and Radio Europe at a cost of about $35 million a year until 1971, when a policy of open funding by congressional appropriation was approved (Victor Marchetti and John Marks, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence [Alfred A. Knopf, 19741, pp. 167-70). [7] In order to avoid inadvertent disclosure of intelligence informants working for Agency A, Agency B may not disclose a given informant’s name to Agency C without A’s approval. One of the side effects of the third agency rule is that it frequently hinders, and occasionally blocks, outside investigations. [8] There was not a shred of credible evidence to indicate that the GAO had been negligent in pursuing its investigation of Jasiuk. It would be a different matter if GAO had received Crossland‘s memo after reviewing the fi le, but I later determined that this was not the case. In any event, that still would not explain why the other agencies failed to respond to GAO’s requests for their fi les.

[9] I asked to see the offi cial who had relayed the message that the fi les did not exist and was told that he was unavailable. He had been sent away for training and was later transferred to a different job. Most of the people I tried to interview about the withholding of fi les had just retired or had been transferred out of the country by their respective agencies. Curiously, each of the retirees seemed once to have worked on intelligence operations in Germany around the time Kushel and Jasiuk had emigrated. On the Sunday closest to that date – which marks the anniversary of the proclamation of the Byelorussian National Republic in 1918 – they gather at the Byelorussian-American Club on Whitehead Avenue to celebrate. Some of the girls and women wear brightly colored national costumes, and there is dancing, drinking, and feasting. On most days, the club is almost empty except for a few old men drinking in the bar, but there are some interesting customers. One of them had thrown small children into a well and dropped hand grenades on them. A frequent visitor to the club had been an executioner at the death camp at Koldichevo. Another club patron teased a visitor known to be squeamish about the Holocaust by picking up a cleaver and hacking at some lunch meats. “I wish these were Jews,” he declared. The old men of South River have achieved a certain respectability. In 1978, the New Jersey American Revolution Bicentennial Celebration Commission published an Ethnic Directory of New Jersey. Heading the fi ve pages of Byelorussian organizations was the American Friends of Byelorussian Central Council. Its president was listed as Emanuel Jasiuk. Radoslaw Ostrowsky had fi nally emigrated to America too. There was no controversy concerning his entry, but his fi le shows that at the time he applied for citizenship in 1972, the INS was notifi ed of Ostrowsky’s complete Nazi background.200 After considerable consultation among the various intelligence services, the INS noted in his fi le that he “appears to have been involved in some sort of espionage activity.” A reporter for a New Jersey newspaper who learned that Ostrowsky was living in the United States asked the Immigration Service if the rumors were true. The INS noted on the letter that it had no record of any such individual, but fi led it in Ostrowsky’s folder.

When the reporter came back in 1975 with several variants on the spelling of Ostrowsky’s name, the INS put that in the folder too, along with the note that the reporter had been advised by telephone that the INS had conducted a full investigation which cleared Ostrowsky completely. 201 And so one of the highest-ranking Nazi war criminals to enter this country lived on undisturbed until his death in 1979. The Eilberg hearings had left the strong suspicion that the INS had not been as thorough as it might have been in investigating the smuggling of Nazis into the United States, and Congress requested the Justice Department to make an inquiry. An Offi ce of Special Investigations was created within the Criminal Division early in 1979, and Walter Rockler, Jr., who had been a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, was named to head it. I joined OSI a few weeks later and was assigned the cases from Byelorussia. For two months I read the translations of the books and documents published by the Byelorussians. I learned enough of the Cyrillic alphabet to recognize the names of the leading Byelorussian war criminals and secured access to the stacks of the National Archives, where I discovered more books and documents that had not been translated. Ostrowsky’s history of the Minsk convention was among them, and in its index I found numerous entries for and references to Stankievich, Jasiuk, and other leading collaborators. I compared this information with captured SS documents stored at the Archives and they corroborated each other. All the evidence clearly suggested that Nazi war criminals had been allowed to emigrate to the United States, and later to become American citizens. There were unanswered questions, however. Who had helped them, and why? And who had been responsible for covering up their records all these years and for stonewalling the Eilberg hearings? In October 1980, as soon as he received my fi ndings, Allan Ryan, my immediate superior, sent a Top Secret report to Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti stating that this was the single most important matter in which his offi ce was engaged. That report said, “It should be apparent that the matters discussed in this report are extremely sensitive, both because of the number of Byelorussian Nazis who entered this country, and the extent to which U.S. Government agencies apparently assisted that entry, possibly in violation of the law.” OSI was authorized to expand the scope of its investigation.

More researchers and translators were hired, and security clearances were raised – my own was three access levels above Top Secret – to permit inspection of the secret records of the various intelligence services. For the fi rst time in thirty years an effort was made to search out and coordinate all the information concerning the Byelorussian Nazis in this country. A key operative was Marc Masurovsky, a young French-born Jew, who worked under cover within the Byelorussian community for two years. Posing as a historical researcher with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Masurovsky was accepted into the homes of the Belarus leaders in South River and other communities. He tracked down and authenticated a large number of documents vital to the inquiry, including the records of the puppet government of Byelorussia and the original roster of the militia units that formed the nucleus of the Belarus Brigade. In the vaults at Suitland, Maryland, I discovered a portion of the many dossiers that had been built up on Stankievich. Included among them was the confession that he had made to Military Intelligence in 1948. Another intelligence agency had dossiers on Stankievich in which he admitted in 1954 that he had ordered the massacre of the Jews of Borissow. Upon learning that the Army offi cer who had taken the 1948 confession was still on active duty, OSI asked to talk with him. The Pentagon’s response was that he was working under deep cover on a secret project in Europe. Eventually, however, he was brought back for an interview by OSI. On his return, the offi cer was shown a series of reports that he had written more than thirty years before, but at fi rst he failed to remember them. “We had many Nazis working for the Army in those days,” he said. Gradually, however, the names and operations came back as his memory was refreshed by the dossiers, and he began to recall some of the details of the cases. When told that the Nazi collaborators mentioned in his reports were now living in the United States as American citizens, he was shocked. “This is mutiny,” he murmured as he dropped the pages on the desk. I asked him how such a thing could have happened.

He telephoned friends at the U.S. Army Investigative Records Repository at Fort Meade, where the records had been stored after being shipped from Germany many years earlier. He found out that the SOD, Special Operations Detachment, a secret unit with a liaison offi cer at Fort Meade, had responsibility for screening the fi les before they were given to other agencies. The following day the two of us went to the post, which is only a short drive from Washington. At SOD headquarters, we confronted a civilian employee who readily admitted that the unit had been routinely ordered by the Department of Defense to look over all dossiers of intelligence informants and had deleted sensitive items. He seemed surprised at our questions, saying he was certain that the OSI had been informed of the arrangement.[1] He was certain the Justice Department itself had approved sanitizing the Nazi fi les. I was shocked to the core. If what he was saying was true, my own agency had been orchestrating the Nazi cover-up, which meant that all our work at OSI was a farce. I asked to see material that had been deleted from ten fi les that I selected at random. The fi rst dossier contained not only Army material that had never been sent to OSI but also documents belonging to other agencies as well. I looked at the name on it: Emanuel Jasiuk. In it was a letter to the State Department from the offi ce of John J. McCloy, the new civilian High Commissioner in Germany. Written at the time that Jasiuk had applied for citizenship, the letter reminded the State Department that three of its offi cials had knowingly allowed Jasiuk to present a fraudulent personal history to the visa-screening offi cer in the Stuttgart consulate. The fi le also contained correspondence between the CIC and J. Edgar Hoover in which the FBI director was explicitly informed that Jasiuk was a war criminal who had worked for Air Force Intelligence.202 None of this material had been supplied to the Eilberg inquiry or to OSI, despite repeated requests. Had it been turned over to the congressional investigators, the cross-references would have uncovered the entire Byelorussian Nazi underground and the subsequent cover-up. Of the ten fi les I reviewed, three contained clear evidence that U.S. agencies had assisted Nazi collaborators to emigrate to this country.

A fourth fi le included the case history of a Soviet spy, Soloviej-Sokolowsky, who had posed as a Nazi during the war but had later defected to American intelligence and provided eyewitness descriptions of war crimes committed by Byelorussian Nazis, including Jasiuk. After confi rming the defector’s allegations through its own network of informants, the Army gave him a new identity and helped him to emigrate to Australia. This information confi rmed the reports that some of the Byelorussian emigres in this country not only were war criminals but that their ranks had been penetrated by Soviet spies. I asked Msrs. Sullivan and Ryan, my superiors at OSI, for permission to investigate who it was at the Justice Department who had been telling SOD to hide Nazi fi les from our own investigators and from Congress. Permission was denied. I suspected then that my own superiors knew more than they were telling. The only explanation was that the Justice Department itself was behind SOD’s obstruction of Congress. There is always a back door, By backtracking through the labyrinth of the various intelligence agency archives, with the aid of the cross-references provided by these fi les, the staff of Belarus Project at OSI built up a strong case for instituting denaturalization procedures against living Byelorussian collaborators. Unfortunately, the United States has no law to imprison the members of the Belarus network for murders committed in their native Byelorussia. Without criminal jurisdiction the only action the Justice Department can take against these ex-Nazi collaborators is to bring civil suit to revoke their citizenship and try to have them deported, a diffi cult and lengthy process. These men perpetrated their crimes nearly forty years ago in a foreign country, and most of the surviving witnesses were living in Eastern Europe. To compound the diffi culties, the Soviet government has failed to cooperate – it withheld evidence against the Byelorussians while providing documentation about other national groups, such as the Ukrainians and Baltic peoples. An educated guess is that this Soviet policy is designed to protect their former, and possibly present, agents who infi ltrated the Belarus network. Stanislaw Stankievich was to have been the fi rst to face proceedings to strip him of his citizenship. As previously explained, there was conclusive proof that he had lied on his visa application, had procured his citizenship by fraud, was an admitted perjurer, a strident anti-Semite, a high-ranking Nazi collaborator, a suspected Soviet agent, and a confessed murderer.

But the “Butcher of Borissow” died on November 3, 1980, before hearings could begin in the federal district court in New York City. Oddly enough, the fi rst report we received of Stankievich’s death came from the Procurator General of the Soviet Union. Late in 1980, the OSI asked John Tipton – the General Accounting Offi ce supervisor who had helped prepare the report downgrading the possibility of a conspiracy to smuggle the Nazi war criminals into the United States – to examine the material we had gathered. We gave him the voluminous fi les that had been amassed on Jasiuk and Franz Kushel. Tipton was plainly embarrassed as he leafed through the dossiers, saying he had never seen the material before. And when he spotted the most recent entries, which admonished the clerks at the Immigration Service not to reveal the enclosed material to the GAO, he shook his head. “My God!” he exclaimed. “How could this have happened?” The cover-up arose initially out of what were perceived to be the legitimate needs of national security. Imbued with the anticommunist spirit of the Cold War, intelligence offi cials decided to fi ght fi re with fi re, to enlist Eastern European Nazis with anti-Soviet backgrounds in a guerrilla and propaganda war against the Soviet Union. These Americans were not evil or vicious; they believed that moral ends justifi ed immoral means. Allen Dulles put it best. Asked why he made use of someone like Reinhard Gehlen, the Director of Central Intelligence replied: “There are few archbishops in espionage. He’s on our side and that’s all that matters. Besides, one needn’t ask him to one’s club.”203 Over the years, however, the emphasis of the cover-up switched from protecting ongoing operations and agents to protecting the men who had smuggled the Nazis into the United States. Wisner and his associates had violated several laws, including the Trading with the Enemy Act, and some statutes of limitations did not run out until 1961, but there were other reasons for the persistence of the cover-up. The major one was the change in the international climate. The Belarus conspiracy was a product of the Cold War and confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rightly or wrongly, the American people and American policymakers were convinced that Stalin was determined to dominate the world and tailored their actions to meet the perceived threat.

Anything that made trouble for the Russians was permissible, including the enlistment of Nazi collaborators. Critics were isolated as appeasers, enemies of the state, or, in the heyday of McCarthyism, “soft on communism.” In the 1960s there came a change in the attitudes of the American public toward foreign policy and covert action. The war in Vietnam, which carried Cold War thinking to its logical end, was deemed too costly in blood and money. Covert action was discredited by the failure of the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs expedition, the attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, and the overthrow of the elected government of Salvador Allende in Chile. It was not the time to disclose the embarrassing details about the smuggled Nazi collaborators. Bureaucracies bury their embarrassments in the fi les. Service on several occasions when asked for information from its fi les, in order to conceal complicity in the smuggling operation. Within the CIA several old OPC hands still loyal to their Nazi protégés frustrated congressional and OSI requests for information in 1979. Exculpatory documents were again inserted in CIA records, and incriminating SS fi les were once more removed from the National Archives. The FBI refused to provide OSI with the complete dossiers on its Byelorussian informants, such as Anton Adamovitch of Radio Liberty. Only heavily censored summaries that did not refl ect the full Nazi background of those under investigation were supplied. Perhaps the sanitizing process continued because of bureaucratic inertia. Without knowing why they were doing it – like Japanese soldiers holding out on Pacifi c islands long after the end of World War II – the SOD clerks continued to delete any information from the fi les pertaining to intelligence operatives connected with Wisner’s OPC. Not all the blame for the cover-up belongs to the Cold War intelligence community. The congressmen who were in charge of overseeing intelligence programs at that time must share the responsibility because of their failure to perform the duties assigned them. As long ago as 1956, Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts, a member of one of the CIA oversight committees, stated: It is not a reluctance on the part of CIA offi cials to speak to us. Instead it is a question of our reluctance, if you will, to seek information and knowledge on subjects which I personally, as a member of Congress and as a citizen, would rather not have, unless I believed it to be my responsibility to have it because it might involve the lives of American", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:198:9cb3c7831ae7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4311, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 199, "text": "Massachusetts, a member of one of the CIA oversight committees, stated: It is not a reluctance on the part of CIA offi cials to speak to us.

They replied that they learned about the Nazis only from contacts in their individual overseas operations, and none of them had ever known of the Nazis in America. They doubted that Wisner or Dulles informed Congress, but most seemed fairly certain that Congress never asked, because members rarely asked about any “operational details.” If Nixon and Rockefeller were given briefi ngs on the Nazis, it was done privately and not through regular channels. One very senior offi cial interviewed recently did recall that C. D. Jackson of Eisenhower’s White House staff was squeezed off the Twenty Committee because he favored psychological warfare rather than the more popular paramilitary and political action programs, which his successors, Nixon and Rockefeller, authorized with enthusiasm. We talked at length about the traditional methods of security compartmentalization, which keeps all but a handful of offi cials from knowing the complete picture of an intelligence operation. I asked if it were possible that this same system of compartmentalization had prevented Wisner’s rivals from discovering the full extent of his Nazi-recruiting program while he was with the State Department, and even after he left the post of DDP. Yes, they replied, it was possible. Wisner would have needed only a handful of operatives in the visa section of various consulates to bring anyone he wished to America. Once the underground railroad was established, it could continue running even after OPC was merged into the CIA, and neither Congress nor the President would know The original purpose of this book was to amass incontrovertible evidence that the Justice Department had organized an obstruction of Congress with regard to the specifi c cases of Kushel, Jasiuk, Stankievich, and Lebed. In each of these cases, the Justice Department knew the truth, and lied about it. Many of the participants, such as Allan Ryan and Richard Sullivan are still alive, and should be compelled by an independent prosecutor to testify about their roles in harboring the perpetrators of the Holocaust from their victims.

Perhaps the Justice Department itself could be sued for its role in hiding the vast majority of the Arab and European Nazi collaborators in the United States. After giving up my career and risking my family’s safety to testify before Congress, I am no longer hopeful that anything will be done. Still, Congress and the American people must know this much: The unlocking of the Belarus secret is not the end of the conspiracy. It is only the beginning. The situation has not improved over the last quarter-century. 205 There is a continuous lack of scrutiny, a heritage of congressional negligence that allows the intelligence community to act on its own authority. When Bill Casey asked Oliver North to set up an “all purpose” private spy organization to trade arms to Iran for money to help the Contras, North was directed to the NSC 5412 authorization of OPC without Congressional approval. North cited 5412 in his notes as justifi cation for his wholesale defi ance of the Congressional ban on funding the Contras. Wisner and Dulles’ legacy haunts us still. Without the assent or knowledge of the present members of Congress, intelligence agencies have smuggled a modern band of “war criminals” into the United States. The leader of this Iranian intelligence group, Chief of SAVAK Moghaddam, was installed in power by the OPC three decades ago and is alleged to have persecuted 200,000 innocent Iranian civilians. Despite full knowledge of his alleged atrocities, Moghaddam was approved for sanctuary in the United States by President Carter’s Justice Department. Although Moghaddam was reported executed in Iran before he could escape to America, it now appears that his SAVAK followers are entering this country in signifi cant numbers.[2] To be fair, some allegations against SAVAK appear to have been falsifi ed or exaggerated. A similar case happened to the MEK, an insurgent group whom the Iranians demanded be put on the terrorist list. The EU, and now the USA, are removing the MEK group from the banned list. The point is that US intelligence is incapable of determining friend from foe, and the Justice Department seems either incompetent or indifferent to Congress’s prohibitions on immigration. The most current example is the Justice Department’s blind spot towards the mass immigration of the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1970’s and 1980’s.

Members of this Arab Nazi organization are clearly ineligible for citizenship, as they openly advocate replacement of the US Government and Constitution with the racist and extremist cult of Al-Salafi yyah al-Jihadiyah. Every civilized western nation, and all of the Arab countries, bans the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group. The US Justice Department and State Department continue to protect the Muslim Brotherhood, the last surviving remnant of the original Arab Nazi intelligence networks. For example, Professor Sami Al Arian, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and co-founder of the Palestinian Jihad Terrorist Group, grew up in Kuwait where his family was close with one of the senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was the uncle of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, one of the chief planners of the 9/11 attacks. It was Al Arian’s brother in law, Masson al Najjar, who taught Khalid Sheik Mohammed in the tiny engineering department at North Carolina Agriculture and Technology College. Among the courses that Khalid Sheik Mohammed studied at NCA&T and elsewhere were building structures and aviation power plants, exactly what he needed to plan the attack on the Twin Towers. Others of Al Arian’s business associates were members of a Palestinian clan that provides most of the logistical and fi nancial support for terrorist groups operating in the United States. When Al Arian obtained a teaching job at the University of South Florida, his brother in law followed with a friend from the clan. Najjar and his clan friend had nearly consecutive social security numbers from the same offi ce in North Carolina and arrived in Florida shortly after each other. Al Arian himself and another Clan member incorporated a Florida “bank” with the exact same name as the bank in the UAE that funded the 9/11 terrorists going through fl ight school in Florida and other states. Apparently Al Arian and the clan opened their “Al Baraka” bank only to enable the 9/11 terrorists to cash their checks in Florida. It is no coincidence that the Muslim Brotherhood’s Florida Bank closed a few weeks after 9/11. With Al Arian’s support, and fi nancial help from the Saudis, Al Arian’s clan purchased a series of auto dealerships in western Florida. One of them was on land owned by Al Arian. Stolen luxury cars across the USA were funneled through the clan’s network to Dhubai where they were re-sold for two or three times their price by a car network run by one of Al Qaeda’s “golden chain” fi nanciers.

Older vehicles were turned into car bombs to kill A brilliant private investigator named Bill Warner of Sarasota, Florida came up with an extremely innovative method of tracking the members of the Clan’s terrorist network. He approached me for a list of all Al Arian’s friends and clan contacts. Warner then sent out an advertisement to each of them enclosing a pre-paid cell phone card. The pitch was to try our new phone company’s international call service free for ninety days, and then decide whether to become a permanent subscriber. One of the idiots in the clan actually used our calling card. In one stroke, we had become the Muslim Brotherhood’s telephone service. As a telephone company, we lawfully purchased the phone bills of everyone our customer contacted, allegedly to recruit new customers. We used the phone bills to identify the clan’s overseas contacts, and then I cross-matched the phone records against the terrorist attacks of Hamas, PIJ, and Al Qaeda, all of which are subsidiaries of the Muslim Brotherhood. The results were astonishing. We had the calling records of the Al Qaeda cell in Ceuta as they planned their abortive attack on shipping off Gibraltar. We could tell that every time a clan member in California called a cell phone in a refugee camp in Jordan, a terrorist attack on Israel would take place that same day. Mr. Warner and I assembled a nationwide map of terrorist logistical cells in America complete with their overseas telephone contacts. We did not trust the Justice Department’s FBI, so we presented our cell phone map to NORTHCOM military intelligence.[3] NORTHCOM ran all of our phone numbers through their terrorist data base. “It lit up like a Christmas tree!” The agent exclaimed. NORTHCOM knew that terrorists overseas were calling American phone numbers, but had no idea who they were contacting or why they were calling. Our little telephone company had provided US intelligence with a nearly complete map of every terrorist cell in the USA and abroad that called the Muslim Brotherhood for help. Despite our regrets, NORTHCOM had to ask the FBI for court authorized search warrants to place taps on the phones and computer terminals of these terrorists supporters. The FBI typically rewrote the warrants as if they had done the investigation. Neither Bill Warner nor I ever received a penny of the promised million dollar reward money.

As we feared, someone in the FBI tipped off the terrorists. They all stopped using the cell phones and calling cards we had been tracing. They all went silent at once. Worse, the FBI closed all investigations by other government agencies into the Florida clan just as they had closed Operation GreenQuest, the Immigration Service’s attempt to trace terrorist funding of Al Arian from the Saudis. The Saudis’ “ International Institute for Islamic Research( IIIR)” is banned as a known funding source for terrorism worldwide, but like the Muslim Brotherhood, it enjoys a strange immunity from the United States Department of Justice. Agents from the US Secret Service and Customs have told me similar stories of the FBI’s obstruction of money laundering for terrorists in the Tampa, Florida Agency. It got so bad that Private Investigator Bill Warner began to openly “out” terrorist internet sites to the press that Justice and the FBI were simply ignoring. But for six critical months, we had an open window into world terrorism, and had made a map of their cells. Our Muslim Brotherhood Map may be one of the secret reasons why there has not been a single successful terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11. Within a year after 9/11, no terrorist in the world could call the Muslim Brotherhood in America for help with fi nding a car, documents, an apartment, or funding without US intelligence listening. We had found the Rosetta stone of the terrorist communications networks. But the same old defects in the intelligence community– “stovepiping,” compartmentalization, and lack of a central intelligence index– that prevented the hunt for Nazi war criminals still obstruct the hunt for the second generation Arab Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, things may have gotten worse since 9/11, not better. The Justice Department and State Department are still fi ghting tooth and nail to conceal and protect the Muslim Brotherhood as a “moderate” network of Sunni Arabs which we can use in a proxy war against the Shiites of Iran. It is as absurd as it is immoral. The Saudi moneymen behind the Muslim Brotherhood have many ties to the GOP. The Carlisle Group is where the Bush family and the Bin Laden family meet to share fi nancial investments.

To this day, Vice President Dick Cheney’s records of Enron’s Taliban connection are classifi ed. It seems that no one in the Justice Department is willing to prosecute anyone in the Bush administration for anything. The same oil companies that made profi ts off the Third Reich and were never prosecuted, are now providing the lifeblood of funding for Arab terrorism. As a former CIA Director told me, Arab terrorism will continue as long as we continue to import Arab oil. A group of us in a privately held company called Liquid Light, are preparing a bit of a shock for the Arabs. We have found a way to manufacture the Holy Grail of Alternative Energy, the Indium Gallium Nitride Solar cell (InGaN). Not only does this InGaN solar cell use 100% of the sun’s bandwidth (as opposed to 20% for existing solar cells), but it can be manufactured so cheaply that an InGaN solar cell can produce electricity at two cents per kilowatt hour versus 10-15 cents per KWH from a carbon based power plant. One hesitates to predict the future of any new technology, but at such a low cost, it is certainly possible that within a decade, solar cell roof shingles could make most homes in America oil/energy independent. It is not beyond the realm of possibility to predict that InGaN products will allow a homeowner to charge his electric automobiles for next to nothing while selling excess power back through the grid for industrial use. If even a tenth of the predicted successes of our “Liquid Light” corporation takes place, the low cost production of Indium Gallium products will transform the American electronics and energy industries, while driving the Arab fi nanciers of terrorism into bankruptcy. Whether the Justice and State Departments like it or not, their Arab friends and their wealthy American backers may not be able to purchase political protection and infl uence in the very near future. The long dark night of corporate corruption of the Justice Department may be coming to an end. Perhaps it is time for President Obama to offer a blanket pardon to every member of the Justice Department (or the Executive Branch) who confesses a part in any criminal activities or cover ups.

It may be too late for Justice, but it is not too late for the truth. [1] In fact, a retired Military Intelligence offi cial told me that the SOD was the unit that at one time served as the principal link between the FBI and military counter-intelligence. Consequently, the bureau had access to the unsanitized CIC fi les for each of the Byelorussian Nazis as part of the FBI domestic counter-intelligence program. That may explain why the FBI fi les made only cursory reference to the fact that its informants admitted serving the Germans during the occupation. The FBI had no need to duplicate the voluminous information provided by the SOD. Perhaps coincidentally, several people associated with the SOD had been stationed in Germany on intelligence operations after the war. I never had a chance to interview them, since they retired from the Army or were transferred overseas immediately after the GAO investigation. [2] President Carter’s Director of Central Intelligence did not even know that his own signature appeared on Moghaddam’s paperwork for the 100 Persons Act. It appears that the Justice Department has completely violated Congressional law, and imports alleged terrorists without any checks or balances from other agencies. [3] Almost all of the rank and fi le members of the FBI are good and decent people. We did not trust the FBI as an institution for several reasons. They repeatedly tried to recruit Sami Al Arian as an informant. Moreover, the FBI’s Special Agent in Charge of the Tampa Field Offi ce was an open supporter of the Congress of American Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR is the propaganda arm of the Hamas Terrorist wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. 5 For post-World War I activities in Byelorussia and émigré politics, I have relied upon V. Kalush, In the Service of the People for a Free Belorussia: Biographical Notes on Professor Radislav Ostrowski, which was published in Byelorussian in London in 1964. A reliable source indicates that this work is actually an autobiography written by Ostrowsky under a pen name. It will be cited below as Ostrowsky’s biography. 7 According to “Parliament Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej” (Parliament of the Republic of Poland) 1919- 1927, edited by Professors Henryk Miscicki and Woldzimierz Dzwonkowski, published by Lucjan Zlotnicki for the Polish Government in Warsaw in 1928, “Sobolevsky was deputy to the Polish Parliament", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:205:557ff758f974", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4318, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 206, "text": "on Professor Radislav Ostrowski, which was published in Byelorussian in London in 1964.

See letter of December 21, 1950, from J. Edgar Hoover to Chief, Security Division, U.S. Department of State. 13 According to the Nazi historical work Weissrutheniein Volk und Land by Eugen Freiherr von Engelhardt (Volk und Reich Verlag, 1943), the leading representatives of the “Byelorussian Union of University Students” before World War II were: Abramchyk, M. (Paris, France); Cherepukan, I. (Chicago, US); Kasmovich, D. (Belgrade, Yugoslavia); Rusak, V. (Prague, Czechoslovakia); Tsikota (Rome, Italy); Vasileuski, K. (Ghent, Belgium); Waronka, J. (Chicago, U.S.); Zakharka, V. (Prague, Czechoslovakia). Over half of the persons on this list became Nazi collaborators during the war. 16 In his biography, pp. 34-35, Ostrowsky admits that in the summer of 1940 he was already in contact with the Byelorussian committees at Warsaw, Poznan, and Berlin. His biography names the leaders of those various committees, many of them former students of Ostrowsky. In a confi dential interview with a Western intelligence agency, Ostrowsky admitted that the work of the committees was secretly funded by the Gestapo. 23 According to captured German documents in the National Archives, the local collaborators were required to register the Jews with provisional visas. The “purpose of the visa: possibility of elimination of all undesirables.” Document of 20 July 1941, Military Administration Group, Army Group Center, National Archives Microfi lm Section T120, Roll 2533, frames 29282G821. 26 The effect of the Nazi instructions to the collaborators can be seen by comparing Report No. 27 (19 July 1941), “Greater Cooperation Is Expected Considering the Catching of … Intelligence, Jews, etc.” with the next week’s report (24 July 1941), “In Minsk, the whole Jewish Intelligentsia Has Been Liquidated.” National Archives Microfi lm Section T175, Roll 233, frames 2721633-637. 29 The connection between the Einsatzgruppen and the provisional administration established in Byelorussia is discussed repeatedly in several captured SS documents contained in the National Archives.

It should be emphasized that these are the actual weekly reports from the mobile killing units themselves. 32 Evidently, Ehoff was pardoned by the Communists after the war. According to the Soviet propaganda booklet “How They Served the People,” p. 34, “David Ehof, a Russianized German from the Volga Region and one of the active participants of the bloody events at Borisov in 1941, now lives in A Free Settlement in the Soviet Union….” 34 The role of the White Russian police in the systematic slaughter of the Byelorussian ghettos is described in the English section of the 550-page Yiddish-language book Sefer Steibtz-Swerzene [Memorial Book of Stolpce] (Israel, 1964). According to Jewish eyewitnesses, the method of extermination was quite systematized: The shrieks of the poor people split the heavens. The lorries were driven by local White Russian drivers. Beside the pit stood Germans, Letts and White Russian police with machine-guns. The Jews were ordered to take their clothes off. Men, women and children stood naked. Their belongings, their rings, their money and everything else was taken away from them. These were placed in a row on the edge of the pit and the machine-guns began chattering and killing. Living people also fell into the pits which were then covered with a layer of sand. Peace and order cannot be maintained in White Ruthenia with methods of that sort. To bury seriously wounded people alive who work their way out of their graves again, is such a base and fi lthy act that this incident as such should be reported to the Fuehrer and Reichs Marshal. The civil administration of White Ruthenia makes very strenuous efforts to win the population over to Germany in accordance with the instructions of the Fuehrer. These efforts cannot be brought in harmony with the methods described herein…. 37 Paromchyk Galina, The Tragedy of Koldychevo, from the library of the newspaper “Voice of the Motherland” (Minsk, 1962), discusses the 1962 war crimes trial in Baranovitche, Byelorussia, of four accused murderers. The book also contains detailed allegations against Ostrowsky, Franz Kushel, Boris Ragulia, Sergei Gutyrchik, and Victor Zhdan, all of whom were alleged to be living in the United States. 40 Many of the collaborators had religious backgrounds. The Orthodox theological schools had lower fees than grammar schools in Byelorussia, although their graduates were restricted to academic careers at the theological seminaries. Up to 1906, theological scholars were barred from the universities (Ostrowsky, biography, pp. 1cb11). 42 Ostrowsky admitted that he had no idea whether the Communists in his administration were secretly planted by", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:207:3ea7b0abb139", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4320, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 208, "text": "Gutyrchik, and Victor Zhdan, all of whom were alleged to be living in the United States. 40 Many of the collaborators had religious backgrounds.

Up to 1906, theological scholars were barred from the universities (Ostrowsky, biography, pp. 1cb11). 42 Ostrowsky admitted that he had no idea whether the Communists in his administration were secretly planted by the NKVD. However, both the SS and the German administration agreed that the shortage of trained collaborators made the hiring of Communist offi cials necessary (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 44-45). 45 Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 49-50, notes that on December 20, 1943, Sobolewsky sent him a telegram from Minsk, as chairman of the Byelorussian Relief Organization (Self-Help) inviting him to a conference the next day with SS General von Gottberg. Sobolewsky’s version of the meeting is contained in The Truth About ABN by Niko Nakashidze (Munich, 1960), p. 54. 47 Decree No. 2 of the President of the Byelorussian Central Council, City of Minsk, January 15, 1944, appointed Kushel, Sobolewsky, and Hrynkievich among the fi rst fourteen members of the Byelorussian Central Council. Copy of document in Byelorussian propaganda book, For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1960, copy in Library of Congress). 48 The Minsker Zeitung is a useful source for identifying the names and ranks of the various collaborators. For example, a man named Russak was identifi ed as the city mayor for Baranovitche and Stankievich was reported as the representative of the Byelorussian Central Council for the region of Baranovitche at the time Ostrowsky visited the city to conduct an anti-partisan propaganda campaign. According to the Nazi press accounts, fi rst Russak spoke of the role of the Central Council in undertaking the war against the “Jewish Bolsheviks.” Stankievich spoke next on the need for building better trust with the German civil administration. Ostrowsky then spoke of the terrible atrocities being perpetrated by the NKVD. 49 Minutes No. 1A of the Byelorussian Central Government meeting of Regional Deputies, and the Byelorussian Regional Defense Chiefs, Minsk City, March 28, 29, and 30, 1944, contains a transcript of the discussion on organizing the draft mobilization for the Nazis. During the meeting, Stankievich complained that their forces were more poorly equipped than the other collaborator military units. One of the other collaborators replied that when we were talking about the “uniforms the question was not to look handsome but to have strength.” Stankievich in return claimed that he had organized a force of some 64 offi cers, 382 sub-offi cers, and 6,000 rifl emen.

(Copy in Byelorussian propaganda book, For the National Independence of Byelorussia, Library of Congress.) 52 The planning for the congress in Minsk took place just as the news of the British and American landings in Normandy were reaching Byelorussia. During one of the planning conferences, Ostrowsky’s vice president, Shkelonak, realized that the invasion meant the end of the German Reich, and suggested that it might not even be wise to hold the congress. When Ostrowsky heard of the blunder, he called the SS offi cial directly and explained that Shkelonak’s German was not that good, and that he really meant the time was right for the congress to begin (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 56-59). 54 Ostrowsky’s close relationships with the SS and the Wehrmacht gave him special standing among the collaborators in exile in Berlin: “Here I should stress that the BCC at that time had such standing that the leaders of the other now Russian nations looked to it in matters of policy. This is probably the reason why Himmler put the BCC most under pressure. Due credit should be given in this connection to the late Professor Dr. Von Mende, who is opposed to Himmler’s policy and who is a great friend to all the non-Russian peoples enslaved by the Bolsheviks.” (Ostrowsky’s biography, p. 62). 55 Franz Kushel insisted that the Byelorussian army should be organized and used only in the struggle against Bolshevism. Apparently, he too was concerned that his troops might be used on the western front. Copy of document in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1960; copy in the Library of Congress). 56 Minutes of the meeting of the Presidium of the Byelorussian Central Council of September 26, 1944 (Berlin) indicated that permission had been received to reorganize the Byelorussian legion. “From the conversation, it can be seen that the German military authorities in principle agree to the organization of Byelorussian military forces, the word army is even used … initially two divisions are to be created, a combat one and reserve one … the outlook for the organization of Byelorussian forces is quite good.” Copy of document in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1954; Library of Congress). 57 The SS unit designation is described in National Archives document microfi lm roll T45426/85-86. According to the Army letter of November 30,1956, from the ACSI-CDOO, “Under the auspices of the German Wehrmacht Kushel was placed in command of Belo-Russian Brigade which subsequently was expanded into a division.

He surrendered to the Germans in what became the French zone of Germany.” The last sentence erroneously suggested that Kushel fought against the Germans, not for them. 58 Minutes of the meeting of the Presidium of the Byelorussian Central Council in Berlin, December 12,1944. The minutes note that Dr. Stankievich, the editor of the newspaper Ranitsa, was invited to the meeting along with Colonel Kushel and several others. Ostrowsky discussed the position of the BCC with regard to General Vlasov’s army. Ostrowsky spoke of the continued need to prevent the Byelorussian forces from being absorbed into Vlasov’s divisions. Copy in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1954; Library of Congress) 59 According to one version, as the Allies were approaching, General Kushel went to see General Maltsov of General Vlasov’s army. Maltsov and Kushel decided to defect to the U.S. Army. Between them and the U.S. troops was a German SS division stationed in Eisensteinstadt. According to a knowledgeable source, Maltsov and Kushel sent emissaries to the American commander and at his direction fought through the German SS division until they reached Zwissel, where they joined the U.S. troops and were interned as prisoners of war. 66 Among Stankievich’s many employers was the Language Institute of the World Church Service at Ulmmanube where he was employed from March 10,1949 to May 1, 1950. It should also be noted that the World Church Service was frequently listed as sponsor of Byelorussian Nazis into the United States under the Displaced Persons Act. 67 According to Ostrowsky’s biography, p. 70, the members of the BCC remained in hiding in the British, American, and French zones of western Germany “because the majority of them were afraid that they might be called to account before the Allies for collaboration with the Germans during the War.” Ostrowsky recognized that it was necessary to suspend the activities of the BCC and create another front group for the U.S. zone, the Byelorussian National Committee, formed at the Regensburg DP camp (where most of the Belarus SS legion was then located). 68 The history of the various postwar conventions, the attempts to escape repatriation as war criminals, and the subsequent reorganization in the United States is more fully described in FBI File NY97-1251. According to the FBI, Ostrowsky’s BCR organization in the DP camps had about 4,000 members, about half of whom later emigrated to America.

This, of course, does not include those members of the Belarus who sided with Abramtchik‘s faction, such as Kushel and Stankievich. As of 1954,according to the FBI, this faction had more than a thousand members living in the United States. 77 Immediately after the war there was a great deal of controversy about the possibility of Nazis residing in the DP camps. See New York Times, March 2, 1946, p. 1 (“U.S. Must Turn Over Members of Axis Army”); March 10, 1946, p. 5 (“Weeding Out Nazis in POW Camps”); May 12, 1946, p. 18 (“Army Screening to Seek Imposters”); March 24, 1946, p. 16 (“Nazis Living in Camps”); March 30, 1949, p. 17 (“Nazi Camp Guard Posing as Displaced Person”); April 1, 1949 (“Former Camp Guard Held at Ellis Island”). 80 Friedrich Buchardt’s unpublished manuscript is entitled “Die Behandlung Des Russischen Problems Wahrend Der Zeit Des Nationalsozialistischen Regimes in Deutschland.” (The Treatment of the Russian Problem During the Period of the Nazi Regime in Germany). Top Secret, ACSI-Sensitive Document File, Suitland, Maryland. 83 The fi rst request for the apprehension of Bandera was by letter from General Sidlov, Chief Soviet MVD, Brandenberg, Germany, dated June 29, 1946, to the Assistant Chief of Staff, United States Forces, European Theatre. A reply was sent by the Army in July 1946 entitled “Bandera, Stephen Andrew, war criminal.” Apparently unsatisfi ed with the reply, Sidlov wrote another letter to General Sibert in August 1946. Sibert, of course, was Gehlen’s supervisor, and Gehlen was Bandera’s employer. Copies of the Army’s subsequent false denial of any knowledge of Bandera’s whereabouts can be found in the Stankievich “blue fi le.” The Soviet Union continued its denunciations of the United States for failure to cooperate with the return of their nationals from European refugee camps. See New York Times, January 5, 1953, p. 3. Stanislaw Stankevich is probably identical with Stanislas Stankevich who resides in Osterhoffen, D.P. Camp. Allegedly he was the former commander of the White Ruthenian S.S. in Minsk. Later he published a White Ruthenian language paper in Germany during the Nazi regime. Currently he is the leader in the US zone of the BNC White Ruthenian National Center, an illegal organization which apparently serves as a steering committee for the rightist elements of the White Ruthenian immigration….

Many of its members were offi cials of the Nazi puppet government in Minsk during 1941-43 and continued as a government-in-exile in Berlin in 1944. In 1951 a letter was sent by the Army in response to the January 1948 UN General Assembly charges that the U.S. was harboring persons listed as war criminals. Included on the list was Stankievich, “allegedly in charge of massacres in the Borrissov region and later editor of the fascist newspaper Ranitsa.” The Army, of course, already possessed extensive information on Stankievich, but told Washington that: Member of the organization “Byelorussian National Center,” a speaker at an Edinburgh Conference of the International Conference of Refugees held under the auspices of the Scottish League for European Freedom,” an anti-communist organization. This was a front group established by Kim Philby of the British Secret Intelligence Service, later known as the Antibolshevic Block of Nations, and later still as the World Anti-Communist League. It is the organization where the eastern European Nazi groups joined forces with their Arab Nazi brethren. Prior to submission of the sanitized report, the Army had received corroborating information from other intelligence agencies that the “Stankiewycz” who attended the Edinburgh Conference was the same person who was charged with having committed atrocities in Borissow during the German occupation, and later became editor of Ranitsa. 96 General Clay was apparently aware of the connection between the Byelorussians and the Nazi government. FBI File NY97-1251 has a copy of a letter from the Byelorussians to Clay in 1948 which describes the political institutions established in Byelorussia “although under the diffi cult circumstances of the German occupation.” 98 The 1948 CIC Consolidated Guidance report, paragraph 167, reported that on the previous December 10, leading White Russian personalities including “Radislau Ostrowsky (former president of the Nazi puppet state), and several other senators who had remained in comparative obscurity after the war, met in a small village near Aalan to rebuild an organization dedicated to the unity of all White Russian people in exile.” The denunciations are not all logical and consistent. It is noted that some of the leaders are denounced for being Soviet agents and for having collaborated with the Nazis, and Stankievich, mentioned above, was denounced for being a Soviet agent, a Nazi collaborator and as a collaborator with U.S. Occupation Forces. 102 According to the 1948 CIC Consolidated Guidance report, a group known as the “White Russian National Counterintelligence” revealed in February 1948 that it was organizing a group of young White Russians in guerrilla warfare and intelligence and was planning to dispatch", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:212:64200c12d904", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4325, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "of the leaders are denounced for being Soviet agents and for having collaborated with the Nazis, and Stankievich, mentioned above, was denounced for being a Soviet agent, a Nazi collaborator and as a collaborator with U.S. Occupation Forces. 102 According to the 1948 CIC Consolidated Guidance report, a group known as the “White Russian National Counterintelligence” revealed in February 1948 that it was organizing a group of young White Russians in guerrilla warfare and intelligence and was planning to dispatch them on missions to White Russia. The group indicated that it would be in contact with U.S. authorities as soon as this organization was ready for action. The leaders of the training group were also noted by the CIC as persons whom the Soviets had desired extradited because of their participation in atrocities in Byelorussia. 105 In the July 12,1955 issue of Novoye Russkoye Slovo, Abramtchik was interviewed concerning the charge that he had been a Communist in his youth. Instead of denying the allegation, Abramtchik said, “I don’t consider it necessary to react with slander. And fi nally, even if I had been a Bolshevik once, there is nothing criminal in that.” The newspaper went on to report that Abramtchik had lost several votes in the Paris emigré organization because the delegates could not elect a man “who had gone to the Soviet Union several times.” 112 This legislation was requested by the intelligence community because all too often agents brought in under the 100 Persons Act would simply refuse to work after they had been granted a visa for permanent immigration. The Parole Powers Provisions allow the intelligence community to bring in an unlimited number of illegal entrants for a “temporary” stay. Once the agents are here, their visas can be voided if they refuse to cooperate. 114 Ostrowsky’s list of delegates at the Minsk convention of 1944 contains the following entry for “Lapitski, Mikalaj”: “Protopresbyter, graduate of the Vilna Theological Seminary, graduate of the Theological Department of the Orthodox Theology at the Warsaw University, member and president of the Theology Student Circle, Superior of various parishes in the region of Hlybokaje and in the City of Minsk, member of the Metropolitan Bureau of the Byelorussian Orthodox Church Administration of the Byelorussian Autocephalic Church, member of the Preparatory Commission to the Byelorussian Autocephalic Sobor of the Byelorussian Orthodox Church in Minsk 1942, member delegate from the clergy to the Second All-Byelorussian Congress.” 116 According to a letter from the CIC Central Registry to the American consulate general in Stuttgart (copy located in Stankievich’s “blue fi le,” USAIRR, Ft. Meade, Maryland), Stankievich also attempted to immigrate to the United States during the mid-1950s under the Refugee Relief Act.

In this document the Army informed the State Department that Stankievich admitted holding the following positions under the Nazis: 119 According to the CIC screening offi cer who handled Jasiuk‘s application for a DP visa, Jasiuk “has been doing work of a highly confi dential nature for an American agency as was proved specifi cally at interview of subject by the persons in the agency for whom he was working.” Wagenaar was one of those who testifi ed. At that time Jasiuk submitted a false background history concealing his Nazi collaboration. None of the State Department offi cials present made any objection, even though they must have known that the information was false. 122 The Kasmowich incident is described in a confi dential memo from the American consulate general in Munich, Germany (January 19, 1955). Following his arrest, Kasmowich was not only released but was later returned to the U.S. zone and given a job with the U.S. Army as an accountant. As of 1966, he was still living in Germany. 129 The American Committee for Liberation was founded in 1950 and its fi rst broadcast went on the air March 1, 1953. According to their brochure, Radio Liberation was a completely independent venture from the older Free Europe Committee which sponsored Radio Free Europe. According to the letterhead of the American Committee for Liberation, 6 East 45th Street, New York 17, N.Y. (supporting the Institute for the Study of the U.S.S.R.), the Board of Trustees included Mrs. Oscar Ahlgran, John R. Burton, William Henry Chamberlain, Charles Edison, J. Peter Grace, Jr., Allan Grover, H. J. Heinz 11, Isaac Don Levine, Eugene Lyons, Howland H. Sargent, Leslie C. Stevens, Dr. John W. Studebaker, Reginald T. Townsend, William L. White, and Philip H.

It is worthy of note that several of the speakers were persons who were accused by the Soviet Union of having committed war crimes and atrocities, including Stanislaw Stankievich.

Unlike most refugees, the new Byelorussian immigrants were mostly registered as Republican. Michael S. Papp, monograph, The Ethnic Communities of Cleveland (1973). 133 Jasiuk‘s participation in the Ukrainian American Congress is described in FBI File NY97-1251. In the same fi le appears the notation that “another governmental intelligence agency, in report of September 19, 1950, advised that Jasiuk in 1942, when White Russia was occupied by the Germans, allegedly worked in one of the departments of the Security Police at Baronovichy, Poland, and allegedly submitted a list of Polish residents to the German Secret Service which resulted in some of the people listed being shot.” The FBI subsequently reported to the Immigration Service that Jasiuk was “trustworthy” and a good anticommunist. 138 By memorandum of July 17, 1952, James M. McInerney, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., advised the FBI that the facts submitted on the Byelorussian Central Administration (also known as the Byelorussian Central Representation) did not constitute them as an agent of a foreign principal as defi ned by Section 20(a) of the Internal Security Act of 1950. The FBI was advised that the Justice Department had decided to conduct a further investigation of the Byelorussians under the Foreign Registration Act of 1938 (FBI File NY97-1251). By memorandum of September 9, 1952, Charles B. Murray of the Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, subsequently advised the FBI that he had received a letter from Jury Sobolewsky submitting additional information on the organization. On the basis of Sobolewsky’s statement, the Justice Department concluded that the Byelorussians were not agents of a foreign principal within the meaning of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. 147 A copy of FBI File NY97-1251 containing the June 5, 1954, interview with Kushel was never placed in his immigration folder. Rather, a copy was sent to the central offi ce of the Immigration Service under the title “““Byelorussian Democratic Republic, Central Council, USA.” The reason for the omission was signifi cant. Within a year after his FBI interview, Kushel gave contradictory information on his application for citizenship. For example, in his FBI interview he admitted that he had become a colonel in the Byelorussian Land Defense for Police organized by the Germans. Kushel also admitted that by the time the Byelorussians fl ed to Germany in 1944, he was in command of several battalions of Byelorussians and he retreated with the German army.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:215:b2483aa03197", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4328, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 216, "text": "The reason for the omission was signifi cant.

The report is a summary of many previous FBI reports on Byelorussian activities dating back to 1951. According to this report, the FBI knew that “the Byelorussian Central Council (BCR) based its claim to leadership upon the fact that it was established at the Second Byelorussian Congress held at Minsk in 1944 under the German occupation” (p. 23). “In July, 1945, when the Soviets were threatening the Minsk area, the Germans evacuated Ostrovsky, Sobolevsky, and many other functionaries to Germany” (p. 24). “Sobolevsky stated that a German S.S. General, Gottenberg, [sic] who was the nominal head of the German forces of occupation, allowed the Byelorussian Central Administration to set up its own government” (pp. 25-26). “Under the German occupation of Western Poland, [Sobolevsky] was appointed Mayor of Baronovichy, and later was responsible for acts of brutality against the people of that city. In 1943, a German S.S. General, Gottsberg, [sic] named Sobolevsky chief of the ‘Zentral Rada’ of Byelorussia” (p. 57). “Sobolevsky in 1942-1943 was chief of the White Ruthenian Self-Aid Committee in the Minsk area” (p. 60). “Sobolesky said that it was true that the organization and he himself cooperated with the German forces in World War II” (p. 62). “The BAA (Byelorussian American Associates) as of May, 1955 had about 1,000 members including the families of members. It had 12 branches throughout the U.S. with the majority of membership residing in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Ninety per cent of the membership were new immigrants” (p. 35). “In September, 1945, Eshersbacken, Germany, there was a meeting of the members of Byelorussian Central Council and a new organization called the Byelorussian National Center was formed with Ostrowsky as its leader. The new organization was so-named so the members could avoid being called war criminals during the time of crisis in Germany” (p. 28). A copy of this book was also found in the classifi ed fi le section of the Central Offi ce of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C. Under the auspices of the German Wehrmacht, Kushel was placed in command of Belorussian brigade which subsequently was expanded into a division. Kushel was made division commander (two-star general) and fought until the end of the war. He surrendered to the Germans in what became the French zone of Germany.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:216:9c6d63dd3c8b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4329, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 217, "text": "(p. 28).

From there, he immigrated to the United States and is presently residing in the New York area. A group of refugee East European politicians have proposed to their western colleagues the recruitment of a volunteer “liberation army” of half a million Russian refugees to form part of a unifi ed American-West European force, according to an Austrian editor who acted during the war as a German army expert on Russia. The editor, Dr. H. A. Kraus, has outlined the plan in [the] Salzburg organ of the Austrian Institute for Economic and Political Research. After pointing out that the United States is faced by the dilemma whether to try to defend Western Europe or let it go and trust air attacks to defeat Russia in the long run, Dr. Kraus observes that in the present stage of public opinion it would be impossible for Washington to send enough troops to Europe to match the Soviet army. But with the aid of refugees from Communism, who must be supported in any case as displaced persons, this could be accomplished, it is argued. By this time (1952) we knew that there was not only a false network involved, although there were some sources that occasionally did produce some information of value, but we knew further that a large number of their so-called intelligence sources were nothing but “paper mills.” These “paper mills” were organizations of refugees or émigrés producing alleged intelligence reports from interrogating other refugees and emigres or from the “cocktail circuit.” These reports were worthless and unreliable and most frequently dedicated to selling a point of view. 171 Various meetings in America between Communist offi cials from the BSSR delegation to the UN and the leaders of the Belarus organizations are described in FBI File No. NY 105-35905. During one of these meetings, one of the Soviet delegates requested and received copies of some of the books published by the Belarus. 178 Senate Resolution 21 adopted by the Senate on January 27,1975, established the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church Committee) to determine whether “illegal, improper, or unethical activities were engaged in by any agency of the Federal Government” (emphasis added).

When the Germans entered Baronovichy, they appointed Jasiuk as head of the town administration of Kletzk. I was working for him for some time. The Germans and Jasiuk ordered me to prepare a deep ditch outside the town, and to bring over 300 arrestees to do the work. Soon thereafter the Jews in Kletzk were rounded up and summarily shot. Jasiuk personally directed the operation (action) and gave all orders to the police squads. Later on he regularly dispatched consignments of victims to the Koldychev Concentration Camp. 188 Letter of April 17, 1978, from Department of the Army, Military Intelligence-Counter-Intelligence Section (DAMIKIS) to USAIRR, Fort Meade, Maryland, requested the Army to check their fi les for persons listed on the GAO request. Both agencies had access to the Defense Investigative Service’s computerized index. Whoever corruptly … infl uences, obstructs or impedes or endeavors to infl uence, obstruct or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which such proceeding is being had before such department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which such inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any joint Committee of the Congress…. 192 One comment in the sanitized report for Kushel is that “President Abramtchik of the Belo-Russian Rada, who is also president of the Paris Bloc, is now staying with General Kushel.” One of the interesting but unanswered questions raised by this document is how Abramtchik managed to get a visa to visit the United States in the fi rst place. Abramtchik has an immigration fi le, but there is no visa in it. There is, however, a letter from an intelligence offi cer to the Canadian border guards. 194 The CIC fi le for “Kusiel, Franciszek,” File XE198433-1181045, contains index cards showing that Kushel controlled the White Ruthenians veterans league and was a leading fi gure in the German SD. Another index card indicates that he was an SS offi cer in “Siegling’s Division” (subsequently identifi ed as the 30th Waffen-SS Division). 195 The fi le for Kushel, Francisek, No. 152 628 (USAIRR, Ft. Meade, Maryland), contains a photocopy of Kushel’s 1947 CIC index card indicating that he was a member of the Byelorussian Central Council and that further references can be found on secret list 700-4.

The index card naming Kushel as the leader of the Michelsdorf DP camp is in this fi le, along with various Top Secret document replacement sheets indicating that even more sensitive documents had once belonged to the fi le but now could no longer be located. The Army has no idea what happened to the missing documents. 196 Among the general subject matter fi les relating to the Byelorussians at Ft. Meade are the following: “White Russian National Center,” “White Ruthenian BNC,” “Association of White Russian Veterans,” “White Ruthenian Student Organization,” “Sakavir Monthly Papers” (March), “Bakauscyna Newspaper” (Fatherland), “White Ruthenian DP Group,” “White Ruthenian Propaganda,” “BNR White Ruthenian National Public,” “White Ruthenian Committee,” “White Ruthenian National Committee.” 197 An interesting thing about the sanitized Kushel fi le was that it was kept in the Top Secret vault at Ft. Meade, although all Top Secret information in it had been removed from it, and all his other dossiers. There were no sign-out sheets indicating who had taken the Top Secret information. Moreover, there was no record of the dossier ever being signed out of the vault. Even the punch-card index for Kushel’s fi le was missing. Apparently, whoever went to the trouble to create the sanitized fi le for Kushel went to extreme steps to insure that it could not be readily located. 198 Jasiuk’s CIC dossier No. X847230A2 also contains copies of the CIC report of Jasiuk‘s connection with Air Force Counterintelligence. These documents were among those forwarded to J. Edgar Hoover by General Weckerling, along with allegations that CIC informants had conclusively established that Jasiuk was a war criminal who was: …well known for his cruelty and persecution of the Polish populace in the area and was responsible for sending many persons to forced labor in Germany. In 1942, during the liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia, subject submitted a list of certain residents of Nieswicz and other cities to the Sicherheits Dienst (German secret service) in Baranowicz, and as a result a number of these persons were shot. 199 According to a note on the reverse of the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s background investigation form, in 1975 the CIC reported that it had at least two dossiers for Jasiuk, one of which was missing, but the available dossier represented “possible derogatory information learned about subject after he had departed to the US.” The information was not shown to the GAO. 201 The FBI was aware of illegal immigration in some cases even before it occurred.

BBC “Summary of World Broadcasts,” December 20, 1979. My earlier assertions that the OPC used these same private organizations to launder funds come neither from Soviet sources nor from classifi ed fi les. All that is necessary to identify the CIA conduits is to check publicly available lists for those organizations that contributed money to Radio Liberty from 1951 to 1971. Radio Liberty has since admitted that during this period 99.8 percent of its income came from the CIA. Monograph, “Radio Liberty–Basic Facts,” Library of Congress, P-134 SC (72) 53. National Archives Box 16 of the CIA’s documents contains the fi les for Mykola Lebed, whom the CIA innocently believed to be a leader of the Anti Nazi resistance in the Ukraine. Justice Department Offi cials Richard Sullivan and Alan Ryan knew that Lebed was actually head of the Ukrainian version of the Gestapo, the SB, hired by CIA’s rivals in the State Department OPC, and sponsored for immigration by the Attorney General of the United States. Lebed’s SB ran an assassination program inside the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Justice Department knowingly assisted the former Nazis of the SB with illegal entry into the United States. Mykola Lebed’s CIA codename is QR/Plumb/2 (P/2) . Dick Sullivan is the Justice Department mole inside the CIA who tried to suppress any further investigation into Lebed’s past as one of the most wanted war criminals in the Soviet Union. To Sullivan’s dismay, his successors at Justice cut back the Lebed investigation, but did not stop it. 4.OSl notified our officer of their intention to contact the Poles and acceded to our officer’srequest for one ek(throu January 9s7)in which toget back tthen.e believe e shoud bject to the OSl proposal.There isstrong ikelihod thatthe Poles and possibiy the Soviets vill publicie such request nd thustry to link /2-an old neesis-to var cries,knowing.as they would,the significance that the request had coe from osi.

Kalush, In the Service of the People for a Free Belorussia: Biographical Notes on Professor Radislav Ostrowski, which was published in Byelorussian in London in 1964. A reliable source indicates that this work is actually an autobiography written by Ostrowsky under a pen name. It will be cited below as Ostrowsky’s biography. 7 According to “Parliament Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej” (Parliament of the Republic of Poland) 1919- 1927, edited by Professors Henryk Miscicki and Woldzimierz Dzwonkowski, published by Lucjan Zlotnicki for the Polish Government in Warsaw in 1928, “Sobolevsky was deputy to the Polish Parliament in 1926, representing the Byelorussian Socialist Party and this was a Communist Party.” Ironically, allegations about Sobolewsky’s Communist background were previously known to the FBI. See letter of December 21, 1950, from J. Edgar Hoover to Chief, Security Division, U.S. Department of State. 13 According to the Nazi historical work Weissrutheniein Volk und Land by Eugen Freiherr von Engelhardt (Volk und Reich Verlag, 1943), the leading representatives of the “Byelorussian Union of University Students” before World War II were: Abramchyk, M.

(Chicago, U.S.); Zakharka, V. (Prague, Czechoslovakia). Over half of the persons on this list became Nazi collaborators during the war. 16 In his biography, pp. 34-35, Ostrowsky admits that in the summer of 1940 he was already in contact with the Byelorussian committees at Warsaw, Poznan, and Berlin. His biography names the leaders of those various committees, many of them former students of Ostrowsky. In a confi dential interview with a Western intelligence agency, Ostrowsky admitted that the work of the committees was secretly funded by the Gestapo. 23 According to captured German documents in the National Archives, the local collaborators were required to register the Jews with provisional visas. The “purpose of the visa: possibility of elimination of all undesirables.” Document of 20 July 1941, Military Administration Group, Army Group Center, National Archives Microfi lm Section T120, Roll 2533, frames 29282G821. 26 The effect of the Nazi instructions to the collaborators can be seen by comparing Report No. 27 (19 July 1941), “Greater Cooperation Is Expected Considering the Catching of … Intelligence, Jews, etc.” with the next week’s report (24 July 1941), “In Minsk, the whole Jewish Intelligentsia Has Been Liquidated.” National Archives Microfi lm Section T175, Roll 233, frames 2721633-637. 29 The connection between the Einsatzgruppen and the provisional administration established in Byelorussia is discussed repeatedly in several captured SS documents contained in the National Archives. See, for example, National Archives Microfi lm Group T175, Roll 233, Report No. 27, frame 2721570; Report No. 21, frames 272149s91; Report No. 21, frame 2721496; Report No. 36, frames 2721692-93; Report No. 90, frames 2722485-87; Report No. 97, frame 2722688. It should be emphasized that these are the actual weekly reports from the mobile killing units themselves. 32 Evidently, Ehoff was pardoned by the Communists after the war. According to the Soviet propaganda booklet “How They Served the People,” p. 34, “David Ehof, a Russianized German from the Volga Region and one of the active participants of the bloody events at Borisov in 1941, now lives in A Free Settlement in the Soviet Union….” 34 The role of the White Russian police in the systematic slaughter of the Byelorussian ghettos is described in the English section of the 550-page Yiddish-language book Sefer Steibtz-Swerzene [Memorial Book of Stolpce] (Israel, 1964).

According to Jewish eyewitnesses, the method of extermination was quite systematized: The shrieks of the poor people split the heavens. The lorries were driven by local White Russian drivers. Beside the pit stood Germans, Letts and White Russian police with machine-guns. The Jews were ordered to take their clothes off. Men, women and children stood naked. Their belongings, their rings, their money and everything else was taken away from them. These were placed in a row on the edge of the pit and the machine-guns began chattering and killing. Living people also fell into the pits which were then covered with a layer of sand. Peace and order cannot be maintained in White Ruthenia with methods of that sort. To bury seriously wounded people alive who work their way out of their graves again, is such a base and fi lthy act that this incident as such should be reported to the Fuehrer and Reichs Marshal. The civil administration of White Ruthenia makes very strenuous efforts to win the population over to Germany in accordance with the instructions of the Fuehrer. These efforts cannot be brought in harmony with the methods described herein…. 37 Paromchyk Galina, The Tragedy of Koldychevo, from the library of the newspaper “Voice of the Motherland” (Minsk, 1962), discusses the 1962 war crimes trial in Baranovitche, Byelorussia, of four accused murderers. The book also contains detailed allegations against Ostrowsky, Franz Kushel, Boris Ragulia, Sergei Gutyrchik, and Victor Zhdan, all of whom were alleged to be living in the United States. 40 Many of the collaborators had religious backgrounds. The Orthodox theological schools had lower fees than grammar schools in Byelorussia, although their graduates were restricted to academic careers at the theological seminaries. Up to 1906, theological scholars were barred from the universities (Ostrowsky, biography, pp. 1cb11). 42 Ostrowsky admitted that he had no idea whether the Communists in his administration were secretly planted by the NKVD. However, both the SS and the German administration agreed that the shortage of trained collaborators made the hiring of Communist offi cials necessary (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 44-45). 45 Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 49-50, notes that on December 20, 1943, Sobolewsky sent him a telegram from Minsk, as chairman of the Byelorussian Relief Organization (Self-Help) inviting him to a conference the next day with SS General von Gottberg. Sobolewsky’s version of the meeting is contained in The Truth About ABN by Niko Nakashidze (Munich, 1960), p. 54. 47 Decree No. 2 of the President", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:226:825402005a04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4339, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 227, "text": "of trained collaborators made the hiring of Communist offi cials necessary (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 44-45). 45 Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 49-50, notes that on December 20, 1943, Sobolewsky sent him a telegram from Minsk, as chairman of the Byelorussian Relief Organization (Self-Help) inviting him to a conference the next day with SS General von Gottberg.

Copy of document in Byelorussian propaganda book, For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1960, copy in Library of Congress). 48 The Minsker Zeitung is a useful source for identifying the names and ranks of the various collaborators. For example, a man named Russak was identifi ed as the city mayor for Baranovitche and Stankievich was reported as the representative of the Byelorussian Central Council for the region of Baranovitche at the time Ostrowsky visited the city to conduct an anti-partisan propaganda campaign. According to the Nazi press accounts, fi rst Russak spoke of the role of the Central Council in undertaking the war against the “Jewish Bolsheviks.” Stankievich spoke next on the need for building better trust with the German civil administration. Ostrowsky then spoke of the terrible atrocities being perpetrated by the NKVD. 49 Minutes No. 1A of the Byelorussian Central Government meeting of Regional Deputies, and the Byelorussian Regional Defense Chiefs, Minsk City, March 28, 29, and 30, 1944, contains a transcript of the discussion on organizing the draft mobilization for the Nazis. During the meeting, Stankievich complained that their forces were more poorly equipped than the other collaborator military units. One of the other collaborators replied that when we were talking about the “uniforms the question was not to look handsome but to have strength.” Stankievich in return claimed that he had organized a force of some 64 offi cers, 382 sub-offi cers, and 6,000 rifl emen. (Copy in Byelorussian propaganda book, For the National Independence of Byelorussia, Library of Congress.) 52 The planning for the congress in Minsk took place just as the news of the British and American landings in Normandy were reaching Byelorussia. During one of the planning conferences, Ostrowsky’s vice president, Shkelonak, realized that the invasion meant the end of the German Reich, and suggested that it might not even be wise to hold the congress. When Ostrowsky heard of the blunder, he called the SS offi cial directly and explained that Shkelonak’s German was not that good, and that he really meant the time was right for the congress to begin (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 56-59). 54 Ostrowsky’s close relationships with the SS and the Wehrmacht gave him special standing among the collaborators in exile", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:227:431f0f0dbda1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4340, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936296047", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned", "chunk_index": 228, "text": "invasion meant the end of the German Reich, and suggested that it might not even be wise to hold the congress. When Ostrowsky heard of the blunder, he called the SS offi cial directly and explained that Shkelonak’s German was not that good, and that he really meant the time was right for the congress to begin (Ostrowsky’s biography, pp. 56-59). 54 Ostrowsky’s close relationships with the SS and the Wehrmacht gave him special standing among the collaborators in exile in Berlin: “Here I should stress that the BCC at that time had such standing that the leaders of the other now Russian nations looked to it in matters of policy. This is probably the reason why Himmler put the BCC most under pressure. Due credit should be given in this connection to the late Professor Dr. Von Mende, who is opposed to Himmler’s policy and who is a great friend to all the non-Russian peoples enslaved by the Bolsheviks.” (Ostrowsky’s biography, p. 62). 55 Franz Kushel insisted that the Byelorussian army should be organized and used only in the struggle against Bolshevism. Apparently, he too was concerned that his troops might be used on the western front. Copy of document in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1960; copy in the Library of Congress). 56 Minutes of the meeting of the Presidium of the Byelorussian Central Council of September 26, 1944 (Berlin) indicated that permission had been received to reorganize the Byelorussian legion. “From the conversation, it can be seen that the German military authorities in principle agree to the organization of Byelorussian military forces, the word army is even used … initially two divisions are to be created, a combat one and reserve one … the outlook for the organization of Byelorussian forces is quite good.” Copy of document in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1954; Library of Congress). 57 The SS unit designation is described in National Archives document microfi lm roll T45426/85-86. According to the Army letter of November 30,1956, from the ACSI-CDOO, “Under the auspices of the German Wehrmacht Kushel was placed in command of Belo-Russian Brigade which subsequently was expanded into a division. Kushel was made division commander (2-star general) and fought until the end of the war. He surrendered to the Germans in what became the French zone of Germany.” The last sentence erroneously suggested that Kushel fought against the Germans, not for them. 58 Minutes of the meeting of the Presidium of the Byelorussian Central Council in Berlin, December 12,1944.

The minutes note that Dr. Stankievich, the editor of the newspaper Ranitsa, was invited to the meeting along with Colonel Kushel and several others. Ostrowsky discussed the position of the BCC with regard to General Vlasov’s army. Ostrowsky spoke of the continued need to prevent the Byelorussian forces from being absorbed into Vlasov’s divisions. Copy in For the National Independence of Byelorussia (London, 1954; Library of Congress) 59 According to one version, as the Allies were approaching, General Kushel went to see General Maltsov of General Vlasov’s army. Maltsov and Kushel decided to defect to the U.S. Army. Between them and the U.S. troops was a German SS division stationed in Eisensteinstadt. According to a knowledgeable source, Maltsov and Kushel sent emissaries to the American commander and at his direction fought through the German SS division until they reached Zwissel, where they joined the U.S. troops and were interned as prisoners of war. 66 Among Stankievich’s many employers was the Language Institute of the World Church Service at Ulmmanube where he was employed from March 10,1949 to May 1, 1950. It should also be noted that the World Church Service was frequently listed as sponsor of Byelorussian Nazis into the United States under the Displaced Persons Act. 67 According to Ostrowsky’s biography, p. 70, the members of the BCC remained in hiding in the British, American, and French zones of western Germany “because the majority of them were afraid that they might be called to account before the Allies for collaboration with the Germans during the War.” Ostrowsky recognized that it was necessary to suspend the activities of the BCC and create another front group for the U.S. zone, the Byelorussian National Committee, formed at the Regensburg DP camp (where most of the Belarus SS legion was then located). 68 The history of the various postwar conventions, the attempts to escape repatriation as war criminals, and the subsequent reorganization in the United States is more fully described in FBI File NY97-1251. According to the FBI, Ostrowsky’s BCR organization in the DP camps had about 4,000 members, about half of whom later emigrated to America. This, of course, does not include those members of the Belarus who sided with Abramtchik‘s faction, such as Kushel and Stankievich. As of 1954,according to the FBI, this faction had more than a thousand members living in the United States.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Americas Nazi Secret - John Loftus_cleaned.txt:229:3843472f2c31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4342, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Around the same time, or perhaps slightly earlier, a strongly similar (if not identical) science became evidenced in China. The science of alchemy is not merely the quest to transmute ignoble metals such as lead, iron, and copper, into noble metals —silver and gold, though this is the defi nition with which most studies of the subject begin. It must be noted, however, that alchemy varies greatly depending upon the time and place in history in which it is practiced, and thus it defi es any brief summation. Anhypostatic: From Greek “an-“ meaning “without,” and “hypostasis,” meaning person. In the patristic writings, anhypostatic means a thing or a state conceived of as totally separated from personal existence. Gnostics and Hermeticists of various stripes have striven to deny the patristic categories of person, energy, and essence by introducing the notion of anhypostatic energies. The alchemical idea of “soul essence” or prima materia fi ts well with the Gnoseo-Hermetic idea of a cosmic force—the energy of the world soul or the Anthropos—that, since it spans all human persons and all other non-sentient beings, cannot be rigidly defi ned as hypostatic. Augustine of Hippo, Bl. (354-430): Bishop of Hippo Regius in North Africa, Aurelius Augustinus, better known as Blessed Augustine, either wittingly or unwittingly constructed a new Christian tradition that had as its central feature a melding of Late Antique Platonic philosophy with the original Christian Tradition that he inherited. St. Augustine’s theology has no real rival in the West; he has formed the Western mind—both Christian and non-Christian—more directly and more pervasively than perhaps any other thinker. Augustine has had no discernable infl uence upon Eastern Orthodox dogma, which directly condemns many theological positions held by the great African writer. Bacon, Roger (ca. 1214 – ca. 1292): A Franciscan friar whose theories on optics and alchemy caused controversy after the 1240s. Bacon is signifi cant through his early use of alchemy as a central component of a grand ecumenical strategy to convert the world to the Roman Catholic Church, a plan that involved the unlikely combination of gigantic mirrors and humorregulating elixirs. Democritus of Abdera (ca. 460 – ca. 370 B.C.): A Greek philosopher born in Thrace who speculated that all reality is composed of atoms. He also taught that the soul is made up of incredibly fi ne spherical atoms, and that these soul-atoms were somehow akin to the element fi re. Later ancient writers put Democritus’s name on many mystical, magical, and alchemical treatises, most notably the Physika kai Mystika, an adapted excerpt from which is found above, in this book’s introduction. ecumenism: Ecumenism is often referred to as the conviction, embodied in various programmes and/or strategies of religious diplomacy, that either 1) many discrete religious groups are, on an", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

No one knows when such ideas began, but the Persians as well as the Greeks and Romans made it a point to search out foreign gods and teachings and to fi nd the wisdom in them. Empedocles (ca. 492 – ca. 432 B.C.): Mystic and philosopher from Acragas in Sicily who authored two poems, On Nature and Purifi cations, fragments of which have survived. He is known for, among other things, introducing the notion of four elements—earth, water, air, and fi re—as the basic “roots” or constituents of matter. Farrell, Joseph P.: A Patristics scholar who graduated with a Doctorate from Pembroke College, Oxford University and who was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Farrell’s signifi cance lies in his astounding combination of insights from various disciplines, an example being his notion that some ancient texts such as the Corpus Hermeticum and the Enuma Elish contain scientifi c ideas only recently rediscovered by modern physicists. His early works, though more strictly theological in nature, are seen by some to be signifi cant though unacknowledged contributions to the history of ideas in the West. Filioque: Latin for “and the Son.” The Latin word was inserted into the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed around 500 A.D., changing the original “the Holy Spirit, Who proceeds from the Father,” to “the Holy Spirit, Who proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque).” This interpolation was opposed by Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, both before the Great Schism (1054) and after, up to the present day. Gnosticism: In its narrow sense, the term Gnosticism refers to a number of heretical Christian groups that are identifi ed as early as the late 1st century A.D. These groups’ teachings often include 1) belief that only a few humans are predestined to return to their maker, the rest being lower creatures, 2) the cosmos is a fallen realm of illusion that imprisons those without knowledge of the immaterial, most-high god, and 3) those in the Christian Church who lack the higher knowledge, including the clergy, are in the most important sense victims of deception, since there is a higher god than the lower one they", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Gnosticism in its wide sense refers to certain features of the mystical and theurgic worldviews held by many during the fi rst few centuries of our era (and also held by many in every epoch since Late Antiquity, even in our present day, i.e. the New Age movement). Aspects of Gnosticism as a broad spiritual tendency include (depending upon which scholar is doing the enumerating): 1) belief in a sharp opposition between the spiritual and the material in man and in the cosmos, 2) emphasis on direct intuition from a transcendent deity to the spirit or nous of man, and an attendant de-valuation of rationalistic knowledge and ecclesiastical structures, and 3) the borrowing and altering of religious myths, texts, and images from established traditions, most prominently that of Orthodox Christianity. It must here be noted that some Gnostic groups formed their own hierarchies and thus were totally separate from the Orthodox Catholic Church. Others who stayed in the Church were censured and/or excommunicated. Heraclius (ca. 575 – 641 A.D.): Eastern Roman Emperor (610-641 A.D.), who probably initiated the “theme” system of military organization in Anatolia, and who attempted to introduce dogmatic compromise between the Orthodox Church and the group(s) of Oriental Orthodox who held that Christ has one nature (a theology commonly known as Monophysitism, a term which is not accepted by these groups). hermeticism: A mystical philosophy (also known as hermetism) that is associated with the so-called Corpus Hermeticum, a group of Greek texts dating from the fi rst few centuries A.D. These texts are mainly dialogues between a Hermetic seeker (sometimes identifi ed as Hermes Trigmegistus, or “Hermes the Thrice-Holy”) and a divine fi gure. The divine fi gure instructs the seeker on how to purify himself so as to ascend past the planetary spheres and their demonic rulers or “archons.” The fi nal goal of this hermetic quest is union with the divine, which is often spoken of as the mortal seeker becoming a god. Anoine Faivre has spoken of hermeticism as the “theory” behind magic, astrology, and various forms of theurgy. Faivre also saw hermeticism’s view of the cosmos as a vast system of indirect connections that were explored through an expanding of the individual seeker’s consciousness.

Joachim of Fiore (ca. 1135-12-2): Founder of the order of San Giovanni in Fiore, Joachim was born in Calabria. He believed that a new age was at hand that would see the rise of a new, inner Church of ultra-Cistercians. Incredibly, Joachim believed that this Age of the Spirit (to be reached in 1260 A.D.) would feature the new Church’s direct contact with God and the inauguration of total freedom on the Earth. Joachim may have been the very fi rst ecclesiastical writer to spark widespread belief in an earthly “thousand year reign.” Late Antiquity: The period of time that marked the end of Classical Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Usually this transitional epoch is thought to span from about 100 A.D. to around 600 or so A.D. In this study, we are including the fi rst century A.D. under the “Late Antique” rubric, and we will also reach back as many as two or three centuries before the time of Christ to highlight texts and events that presaged spiritual and social developments which blossomed into the mystical soup that was Late Antiquity. Leibniz, G.W. (1646-1716): A German mathematician, philosopher, and ecumenist whose greatest contribution to the modern world is his invention (developed independently from Isaac Newton, but at approximately the same time!) of the infi nitesimal calculus. He also improved and rethought the binary number system that is a foundation stone for computers and thus for virtually all modern technological developments. Chapter Three of this study hopes to cast a spotlight on Leibniz’s lifelong struggle to develop an effective strategy for uniting the Lutheran Church with other Protestant groups and especially with the Roman Catholic Church. The most interesting and unexpected aspect of Leibniz’s irenicist quest its reliance upon mystical concepts, teachings, and models that can be traced back to Hermeticism and to Gnosticism. Middle Ages (Medieval Period): The period between about 500 or 600 A.D. and ca. 1500 A.D. featuring—in Europe—a feudal society of mainly farming and shepherding peasants and aristocratic knights and lords. The high culture of the Classical period was replaced with a Church-centered culture that looked to the Papal States and later to the Frankish Emperor as guides. In the Eastern Roman Empire, this time period saw imperial expansion and later collapse, as Islamic Civilization ended the viability of the Roman Empire in the East in the sixteenth century. In Frankish medieval political theory, the king was seen as being, in some sense, one with Christ. Also, the king was seen to be a wielder of military and spiritual power.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

In Frankish medieval political theory, the king was seen as being, in some sense, one with Christ. Also, the king was seen to be a wielder of military and spiritual power. The political theory behind this Frankish Christ-king was traced back to Nestorian and Monophysite theological writings by Ernst Kantorowicz, leading the latter to speak of a royal “monophysitism” in the medieval West. Nestorianism: The teaching—named after its purveyor Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinope from 428 to 431 A.D.—that Christ’s humanity and His divinity are two separate persons that forge a contractual agreement to be one, this pairing being put forth as the meaning of the Son of God’s Incarnation as Jesus Christ. Condemned as heresy at the 3rd and 4th Ecumenical Councils of the Orthodox Catholic Church (5th century A.D.). nous: Though often mistranslated as “mind,” nous is a Greek word that means the deepest inner personal existence of man, his or her “spiritual mind.” The ancient Greeks had confl icting ideas about anthropology, at times declaring the physical body to be a fi lthy prison—“soma sema,” meaning “body tomb.” At other times, as refl ected in the fi gure of the iatromantis, the Greeks viewed man holistically, as a single undivided bodysoul (my term). Osiris: The Egyptian god of the dead, the afterlife, and fertility. Husband and brother of Isis, Osiris is killed and dismembered by the evil god Set, though Isis revives him and bears the deity Horus, who avenges his father by defeating Set. The fi gure of Osiris ties together ancient fertility rites and king cults with the esoteric sciences that included alchemy and which blossomed in the fi rst centuries A.D. Many esoteric Greek and Egyptian texts name Osiris, Isis, and Set as the three sides of a 3-4-5 triangle, the fi gure used in the so-called Pythagorean Theorem. Horus was the hypotenuse, the holy progeny of the Father and his Consort, the triangle representing the divine harmony of the cosmos, which is also a dynamic force that unfolds and, though divine, actually expands and grows! Orphism: A set of mystical religious texts and esoteric practices that date back to the time of Pythagoras, many Orphic writings purportedly being from the Samian’s own pen. Orphism emphasized a religious initiation that served to safeguard the initiate’s journey to the heavenly realm after death. Many intriguing but maddeningly inconclusive tangents with Pythagoreanism rear their heads to any who investigate Orphic texts: Both Orphics and Pythagoreans emphasize asceticism, spiritual fatherhood under a guru, and vegetarianism, not to mention a similar cosmology shot through with an ambiguous dualism.

Music and song, true to the movement’s namesake, are also important to Orphics, as they are to Pythagoras and his followers. prima materia (also materia prima): Latin for “fi rst source” or “primary matter.” In alchemical theory, prima materia is the utterly simple substance that contains every quality and manifestation in potentia. Some alchemist’s saw their task as a retracing of matter’s path of differentiation back to the original undifferentiated prime matter. Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 570-495 B.C.): A scientist and a mystic philosopher from Ionia who formed a sect with political ambitions in the 6th cen. B.C. in his native Samos and later in Croton (Southern Italy). Pythagoras saw all of creation as a product of the “elements of numbers.” This theological doctrine seemed to teach that the proportion or relationships amongst the various physical bodies (and the unseen spiritual harmony that undergirds these relationships), a unity based upon certain contrary yet complementary cosmo-divine forces and their development, is divine and is the goal of all human striving. Zosimos of Panopolis (3rd-4th cen. A.D.): An alchemist as well as a Gnostic philosopher born in Panopolis (present day Akhmim) in Egypt ca. 300 A.D. He was perhaps the fi rst to present a detailed picture of alchemical practice that was fully-fl eshed out both as a chemical and a spiritual endeavor. After learning these things from my master and aware of the diversity of the matter, I set myself to make the combination of the natures. But, as our master had died before our initiation was completed and we were still all taken up in learning the matter, it was from Hades, as one says, that I tried to evoke him. I applied myself to the task, and, as soon as he appeared, I apostrophised him in these terms, “Are you going to give me nothing in return for what I have done for you?” But despite all our searching we found nothing; and so we gave ourselves a terrible lot of trouble in trying to learn how substances and natures were united and combined in a single substance. Well, when we had realized the synthesis of matter, some time passed by and a festival was held in the temple. We took part, all of us, in a banquet.

Then, as we were in the temple, all of a sudden a column of its own accord opened up in the middle. But at fi rst glance there seemed nothing inside. However, [our master’s son] told us that it was in this column his father’s books had been placed. And taking charge of the situation, he brought the thing out into the open. But when we bent to look, we saw in surprise that nothing had escaped us except this wholly valuable formula which we found there. “One nature delights in another nature; one nature conquers another nature; one nature overrules another nature.” Great was our admiration for the way he had concentrated in a few words all the Scripture. I cannot suppress a good-hearted chuckle as I wonder what you, dear reader, will make of this curious passage.1 Its language and its setting suggest something between a Nag Hammadi scroll and a Hassidic folk tale. Think of the texture of the acolyte’s coarse linen robe, the smell of incense (not the wretchedness peddled at New Age bead shops, but the kind of thing an old Bedouin’s spice box would reek of). In the ancient world, knowledge (Gr. gnosis) was often associated with exclusionary social, religious, or clan groups. These organizations, the world’s earliest craft guilds, often required existing and/or prospective members to undergo initiations. These ceremonies were religious in nature, and this spiritual orientation was evinced in every aspect of these groups’ craft or other activities. Though craftsmen’s handbooks were not unknown— some of which we will be examining in this study—such rare examples of written gnosis were not for public consumption. Some were accompanied by dire warnings, such as the Babylonian text that cautions: “The young priest may see these rites which you perform, but the stranger who does not possess the hereditary knowledge of the rites shall not see them, unless he wishes his days to be shortened.”2 Thus, in the ancient milieu, it was common for texts pertaining to knowledge to be jealously guarded by the groups that produced them. In fact these exclusionary groups’ organizational structure was based upon 1) a strict code of secrecy; 2) the separation between those who have been initiated into guild insiders and uninitiated outsiders; 3) a spiritual, even familial bond between master and apprentice; and 4) the preservation of specialized knowledge with a concomitant way of life characterized throughout by intertwined practical and spiritual aspects and applications.

With these points in mind, let us recount the gist of our mysterious text: A master craftsman and mage named Democritus journeys to Egypt, where he comes under the tutelage of an unnamed guru, who teaches the neophyte about the inner principles of matter and the “combination of (material) natures.” The guru has a “son,” here indicating a star pupil or intermediate student, who is in line to receive the esoteric teachings of the guru, but before this arcane tuition can be passed on—alas!—the teacher perishes. An undeterred Democritus invokes the dead man’s spirit from Hades, though he is opposed by a demon. Next we fi nd our seeker in an Egyptian temple—the occasion a “banquet,” doubtless some sort of religious ceremony—where a pillar splits open, revealing the books of the departed holy man. In this precious cache is found the entrancing proverb about the sympathy, antipathy, and overpowering of natures vis-à-vis natures. Though we, dewyeyed onlookers, perhaps do not yet grasp the signifi cance of this saying, our Democritus and his companion certainly do know, directly and intuitively, that their master’s chemical key is nothing less than the divine wisdom they have spent their lives seeking. Alchemy4 sprang into existence during the fi rst centuries of the Christian era, when the trade networks and population shifts associated with the expansion of the Roman Empire encouraged or forced a large number of ethnic and social groups into cramped urban centers such as Alexandria and Rome. Recall Pliny the Younger’s comment that the Christians were numerous in the city of Rome because every wicked and dangerous sect and persuasion fi nds its way into the city, where it tries its luck and sometimes succeeds. As for Alexandria, I believe it impossible that anyone, myself included, can comprehend fully the uniqueness of this late antique jewel. Moreover, I am certain that Alexandria, with its temples, libraries, and commercial complexes, contrasted even more with her neighboring hamlets than does any modern metropolis vis-à-vis its outlying towns. Because of this and many other reasons, it is an arduous task for a historian to untie the Gordian Knot of “isms” that wafted like incense through the air of the Late Roman world, a scene replete with cosmopolitan ports and fl avor-of-theweek religions. However, we are aided in our task by the fact that, whatever number of confusing and seemingly confl icting infl uences seemed to weigh down and otherwise saturate these late antique writers’ letters, handbooks and treatises, they all", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Thus, we have a more-or-less liturgical constant, a handing down of various occult traditions of knowledge and ritual practice that served as a force of continuity amid the shifting sands of the early centuries A.D. In the neck of the Roman woods upon which we will focus—Northern Egypt —there were a number of groups from various intellectual and religious backgrounds, some exhibiting features of the above described craft fraternities. A few of the groups who contributed something—however indefi nable—to the late antique Alexandrian milieu were: 1) societies of Egyptian priests, many if not all of whom were craftsmen who had to fi nd ways to supply the almost endless demand for gold cult objects for the Dionysian ceremonies that became popular after the age of Alexander the Great.5 The few early gold- and silvermaking recipes we have found (which either show how to plate alloys of base metals with noble coatings, or simply instruct the craftsman on how to create alloys that gleam with noble hues) were doubtless used by these priests, many of whom—to judge by the recipe texts—were not ignorant of or averse to Hermetic and Gnostic religious notions.

A.D.), who recommended a kind of incubatory spiritual meditation as a necessary preparation for any kind of metallurgical or other craft-oriented work, was himself probably a high-ranking Egyptian initiate;6 2) associations of craftsmen, which appear to have been, in some ways, a cross between a Greek mystery cult and an ancient craft guild. We are certain that within ancient craft culture the forge was considered to be a fearful locus of power. In fact, the ceremonies performed by these craftsmen to render the forge safe for use sometimes involved human (even infant) sacrifi ce. The forger felt that he was interfering with the natural ripening of base metals into noble ones, and that the god(s) of the craft had to be appeased or otherwise dealt with before any transmutation could take place.7 Some scholars have pointed to the forger’s invention of cupellation—a process in which a mass of silver ore or other type of ore is heated, causing the ignoble metals to be separated from the precious ones—as a major breakthrough in the direction of alchemy,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

For now, I am lumping together under this rubric anyone in Egypt who claimed to be following the teachings of Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 570-495 B.C.).9 The next few pages will include a few words concerning the Pythagorean infl uence upon the early alchemical writings. Let it be said here that Pythagoreans were an ascetic religio-political society founded by Pythagoras himself in the Ionian city of Samos and later in Croton, which is in Southern Italy. Now, instead of doing the expected thing—trudging through lists of arid facts in the hopes of defi ning alchemy—I would like instead to linger just a bit upon the surreal text with which we began, the one purportedly written by Democritus known as the Physika. If we do not fi rst get some kind of feel for the texture of late antiquity, we will not gain any insight into our subject, but rather will be left with a useless string of names and dates. First of all, we should note the decidedly Egyptian fl avor of the material. Democritus is hanging around Egyptian temples, and he is calling up his guru—probably a member of an association of Egyptian temple prelates— from an Osirean slumber. Plus, it is remarkable that Democritus’ description of his life as a spiritual child of a once-living spiritual master who, aside from his other abilities, appears far from ignorant of matters chemical and metallurgical—has the feel of an initiation into a Greek mystery cult, with its torchlit “banquet,” strict code of secrecy, and even an epoptai (the so-called “showing” of a sacred object in a mystery cult initiation) of sorts in the sudden revelation of the guru’s writings in the pillar. Let us not forget that this “hidden book in temple” theme was common to alchemical, Hermetic, astrological, as well as mystery cult literature, and that the Physika—a kind of archetypal alchemical source—features the revelation of the sacred text in a specifi cally Egyptian initiation ritual is, in and of itself, signifi cant. It is important to note that this exotic birthplace for alchemy—a dark corner in an Egyptian temple in Alexandria—with its very idiosyncratic set of religio-philosophical reference points, fades quickly from the minds of later scholars who would rather see in the origins of chemistry an outgrowth of “Greek rationalism” rather than", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

These scholars usually put down their stakes in Renaissance soil, from whence they glance back at a supposedly non-mystical Medieval alchemy, though they quickly wheel around to the seventeenth century, where one can fi nd comfort in the skeptical chemistry of Robert Boyle. From this dubious vantage point, the Renaissance appears a momentary spasm of mystical ecstasy that can be of little real interest since the Renaissance alchemist (so their logic follows) was not the sought after proto-scientist, but more of a mystical crank. Since I will quite belabor the point later on, let me briefl y assert here that this idea of alchemy as, at its core, a strictly “scientifi c” endeavor (in the modern sense of the word) is, as one writer recently put it, a “scandal” of scholarship, since the distinguishing mark of alchemy in every era is its dual focus upon what is going on in the lab and what is going on in the soul of the alchemist.10 Our later examination of many more alchemical texts will easily prove this point, which, like many other important facts of history, would be obvious, were it not for the unbelievable hubris of the scholarly voices that gainsay it. That the foregoing thumbnail sketch of what I call the “grand alchemical narrative”—alchemy as non-mystical proto-science—is a gross distortion should already be apparent. What is less obvious is the connecting line between this historiographical fi ction and the pop-culture image of alchemy, the latter being the one I myself held when I fi rst started researching this fascinating topic. Before I actually got my scholarly elbows dirty tracking down the primary texts of early alchemy—those mainly of Greco-Egyptian provenance—I imagined that alchemy most likely took shape somewhere on the Eastern border of Germany in some Teutonic Faust’s castle or perhaps a German monastery library’s basement fi lled with blackened-faced friars; so I mused early on, doubtless infl uenced by modern day novels and fi lms. To be certain, alchemy carried on and even fl ourished in Medieval Europe—and we examine this history in Chapter 1—but its genesis lay in an earlier time far removed from the fi efdoms, castles, lords, and bishops of later European history.

Actually, though the term “alchemy” was coined in Medieval Europe, originally it was variously referred to as the “Sacred Art” or “Great Work,” or some such grandiose label,11 and began, as far as we can tell, as a mystical science or holy craft in Hellenized Egypt around the 1st century A.D. The goal of the craft, it is agreed by most scholars, was twofold: 1) to change baser metals into silver and gold, and 2) to achieve the personal salvation of the craftsman. Fabrizio Pregadio makes the following apt comments about the Sacred Art’s origin: On the one hand, the techniques for refi ning and transmuting minerals and metals do not constitute alchemy per se, as they do not necessarily imply the existence of a doctrinal and soteriological background [since] the techniques may come to be transmitted separately from it. (-) On the other hand, the doctrinal principles at the basis of the compounding of the [alchemical] elixirs are shared by alchemy with other traditions and disciplines…. (-) Alchemy, in other words, cannot be defi ned either by its techniques or by its doctrinal foundations alone but rather…by the relationship it establishes between “practices and speculations,” or between techniques and doctrines.12 Pregadio’s insight that the laboratory of the Great Work always operated on mystical religious foundations of varied content and origin is illustrated by the texts of Greco-Egyptian alchemical tradition. Zosimos of Panopolis, a Greek speaking Egyptian who fl ourished around 300 A.D., is the earliest alchemical writer to have had a large enough portion of his work survive to afford a full-fl edged scholarly examination and analysis. Zosimos believed that alchemical operations were to be conducted at propitious times and seasons, taking into account various astrological and meteorological factors. Indeed, Zosimos’s astrology is that of Egypt, with its Babylonian provenance, adapted Zodiac, and openness to Judeo-Christian and even Gnostic articulations.13 Not only that, but Zosimos believed in demons, and he used the same terms for God that are found both in certain Gnostic writings as well as in some Neoplatonic treatises. Another name that pops up in Zosimos’s work is “Hermes,” who Zosimos cites from the infl uential Corpus Hermeticum, that body of texts whose idiosyncratic spiritual teachings inspired the coining of the term Hermetism, or Hermeticism. So, how do we get a grasp of this thing called alchemy? And, while we are at it, why have we not mentioned gold? Alchemy is gold-making, right?

In the Egypt of his time, Zosimos was a master craftsman and a religious guide of the highest order. Indeed, he was a trainer of trainers in the world of Egyptian craftsmen, as we can ascertain from his writings. Zosimos cites Democritus’s Physika often, and he doubtless follows Democritus in seeing the true alchemical teaching not as a mere myth, but as a “mystery.”14 In the Hellenistic world, “mystery” or “mysteries,” at least in the context Democritus used it, referred to initiatory rites and pieties that constituted a spiritual journey for the initiate. Over the course of this journey, the traveler underwent purifi cations (which may have include fasting and bodily privations), heard sacred words chanted or read to him or her, and who fi nally viewed certain sacred objects. The end result, for the initiate, was 1) The foregoing brief discussion of Zosimos’s background—with its ties to Hermeticism, Egyptian temple worship, and mystery cults—gives us a suitable starting point for understanding where alchemy came from; indeed, it is quite a different picture than that painted in the lurid though gripping tall tales of Medieval romances. The Medieval period had its castles, its knights, and its jousting tournaments, all of which have been painlessly transferred (though not without inevitable distortions) to Walter Scott’s mega-selling historical novels and to Hollywood movies such as Robin Hood. Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose, despite its unconventional setting—a Medieval monastery, no less!—succeeded both as a novel and a motion picture. By contrast, the period between the height of Augustan Rome and the dawn of the Middle Ages at the beginning of the 6th century—called Late Antiquity in the scholarly world—offers few conceptual landmarks or iconic scenes to correspond to the Medieval period’s seemingly built-in melodrama. In fact, it has taken the rare gifts of such erudite scholars as Averil Cameron and Peter Brown to provide anything approaching a reliable roadmap to the social and intellectual life of Late Antiquity. The enigmatic haze that is the political and economic history of the period is quite enough to provoke fi ts of clothes-rending, but any attempt to trace the general thought patterns of Late Antique man—that is, to fi nd the commonalities between its sociopolitical and religious aspects—seems to require even more patience.

Amidst all of this ambiguity and uncertainty, I argue that there does seem to be a “theory” of alchemy that we can isolate, though it must be stipulated from the get-go that this theory has many varieties, in the same way that Platonism, despite its myriad incarnations, retains certain unmistakable features or motifs that ring out differently depending on the historical period in which they are played. For those who are suspicious of the kind of sweeping history that imposes an imagined unity on totally disparate historical events, let it be known that I do not plan to go beyond widely accepted facts about history and the diffusion of cultures, although this “wide” acceptance is often hidden in various studies spanning different languages and disciplines, and thus needs to be drawn together, as indeed this study hopes to do. Alchemy meant many different things to many different people, but because so many alchemical writings speak about reducing metals to a primal state and also about snakes biting their own tails and World Eggs, I feel more than warranted in theorizing about what these identities, far-fl ung over vast stretches of space and time, mean. So, suffi ce to say the following pages will include a generalized overview of how early alchemists described the actual process of transmutation. I will choose features, themes, and operations that are spoken of by alchemists from different times, places and groups. Before attempting this overview of the actual alchemical process(es), however, we will fi rst discuss ancient Greek matter theory and how it developed into Pythagorean cosmic teachings. Without this context, the subsequent discussion of alchemical process would be incomprehensible. At the bottom of the cylinder was a wood or charcoal fl ame that heated a mass of mercury or sulphur located on a platform partway up the furnace, the whole apparatus being closed rather than open to the air. Fumes from the heated mercury or sulphur rose up through the holes in a metal plate that lay fl at across the lip of the cylinder.

Over the metal lid was placed a bowl, and within the upper chamber was put a chunk of silver or some other ore with precious metals hidden within. The result of this metal cooking operation is interesting: First the mercury or sulphur fumes cause the ore above to blacken with oxide, then to turn white as the mercury accumulates on the metal’s surface, and fi nally, as a third stage in the transformation, the ore turns yellow as the gold and/or silver in the chunk bonds with the particles of mercury on the metal’s surface. If we follow A.J. Hopkins in focusing on the indirect path taken by the sulphur fumes (the direct path being the heating of the ore by the fumes through the grate-holes), we observe another process, parallel to the ore mass’s color changes, that adds another dimension to the spectacle: The rising fumes of sulphur pass through the holes in the kerotakis plate and condense on the cooler head at the top of the cylinder; then, the condensed drops fall down upon the mass of ore that sits on the central sieve, this being referred to as the metal’s “bath” by alchemical texts, since the drops are “constantly bathing the shiny alloy causing it to lose its metallic sheen and changing it to a black sulphide.” Thus, the sulphur/mercury “pursues” the metal through “aer” and through water, an odd fact that surely was not lost on the alchemist, who was already aware of the idiosyncratic properties of mercury and sulphur.16 Though this process does not create gold, it does create an alloy that is gold in hue. This is the process (or at least one of the processes) that inspired alchemists to theorize about what they were accomplishing and how they were accomplishing it. Since this earliest alchemical transmutation was actually a specifi c type of metal tinting, we may conclude that, to these Greco-Egyptian alchemists at least, changes of color indicated changes of nature, of physis. To the alchemists, the different colors—black, silver, gold —indicated different levels or modes of existence (both for the metal and for themselves), these levels, in turn, correspond to different regions of the cosmos. Gold corresponded with 1) the sun, as well as 2) aither (fi ery air) in particular, and with 3) the highest region of the universe in general, the latter being beyond the realm of the fi xed stars in some writers’ conceptions.

This idea of a metal-heaven nexus goes back to ancient man’s original discovery of metal in meteorites. To judge by ancient and modern evidence of folk practice and belief, the metal that fell to earth in meteors was originally believed to have been broken-off fragments of the substance of heaven! Evidence reveals that a similar belief was—and in some places, still is—held about natural crystals. Because of the geometric regularity of their shapes and their often bright hues, it was believed by many that natural crystals were fragments of hardened fi re—this fi re conceived as a kind of spark or energy of the cosmos—owing perhaps, paradoxically, to their apparent greater level of abstraction compared to other mineral fragments. Indeed, these precious gems and crystals appeared not unlike basic building blocks of more differentiated bodies; as substances existing in a state closer to the undifferentiated primal waters of creation, they were honored as celestial substances made of a more perfected stuff. (Also note that this craft-folk belief about natural crystals seems to be the inspiration for Plato’s idea of the progression of fi ve regular solids.)17 Later, Babylonian astronomy added the idea that a number of regions surrounded the earth like concentric circles, each one purer and closer to perfection than the one it encased; also from Babylon comes the idea of the twelve sections of the sky corresponding to a god—the Zodiac.18 As for the concentric spheres, each was ruled by an archon, and each archon was associated with a metal, the scale of metals moving from base metals like tin and lead up to, at the highest reaches of the heavens, silver and gold. By the time we arrive at the fi rst centuries A.D., the early alchemists in Hellenized Egypt such as Democritus, Mary the Jewess and Zosimos of Panopolis have dovetailed all of these strands with Greco-Egyptian spiritual practices to create what they called the Great Art, though it is doubtful that they thought themselves to be “creating” anything, alchemy being seen as a kind of divine gnosis that reveals, not merely some aspects or types of process, but rather reveals the reality and power of process itself. Part 1 will explore the most salient orientations that tie in to this cosmic power fl ow, namely the spiritual, cosmic and theological. At this point, we must come to grips with an element that is central to any notion of alchemy, but about which we have thus far merely hinted: Hermetic cosmology. What is meant by “Hermetic”?

Well, the actual term Hermetic indicates anything originating from or inspired by Hermes Trismegistus (“Hermes the Three-Times Holy”), a mythical being who was thought by many to have initiated all magical and/or mystical traditions (see Glossary entry “Hermeticism”), including alchemy. For our purposes, I am using the adjective Hermetic to mean any text or artifact that relates to that stripe of Hellenistic religion that includes some or all of the following characteristics: 2. A belief (shared by those called “Orphics”) that the cosmos is an organism dual at its very heart, this duality forming not a simple opposition but rather having two complimentary sides—as in an egg’s having an inner aspect, perhaps its golden yolk, and an outer aspect, for instance its white or its shell. 3. These two sides of the cosmic coin and their interrelation, when viewed from an enlightened perspective, reveal the deepest nature of all processes, the secret of controlling the development of individual natures or existents toward perfection. Often this dualcored cosmos is described in terms of a central point—a limit— that appears in the midst of the undifferentiated and unbounded initial unity. In Orphic texts, this central point is a kernel that emerges from the primal waters, spreads out in every direction from the central node, and fi nally splits to reveal Phanes, the god of light and father of the other gods. This latter development results in a macrocosm, a World Egg, whose substance partakes of both the “inner and “outer,” of light and dark, and whose ambiguous status is overcome by individual beings becoming reunited with their origin, the central light.19 In “The Visions of Zosimos,” a Greco-Egyptian text from around the year 300 A.D., Zosimos of Panopolis purports to pass on the true method and meaning of alchemy by describing to the reader a series of dreams. Each dream is presented by Zosimos as an allegory of a particular stage in the transmutation process. For Zosimos, though there are many “colors” or substances utilized in the Sacred Art, “the separation of the spirit from the body, and the fi xation of the spirit on the body are not due to foreign natures, but to one single nature reacting on itself, a single species, such as the hard bodies of metals and the moist juices of plants.”20 First the metallic body is de-spirited; then, and only then, spirit and body are reunited at a higher level of integration and power.

Keep this “giving up the ghost and getting it back” theme (my phrase) in mind while we also bring into focus the Hermetic cosmology, in which the master binary of inner-outer corresponds not only to the Zosimosian spirit-body opposition, but also to other related pairs spoken of in alchemical theory, such as male-female and even goodbad.21 For all things are interwoven and separate afresh, and all things are mingled and all things combine, all things are mixed and all unmixed, all things are moistened and all things dried and all things fl ower and blossom in the altar shaped like a bowl. For each, it is by method, by measure and weight of the 4 elements, that the interlacing and dissociation of all is accomplished.22 Zosimos sees the Sacred Art of alchemy and its ascending path from lead to gold as a rise through the realms of the four elements—earth, water, air, and fi re. In this, he seems to be following Plato’s cycle of the elements presented in Timaeus. In order to grasp the signifi cance of this alchemical ascension through the four elements, we must circle back to the fi rst text we mentioned, Democritus’s Physika kai Mystika, which contains—if we are to judge by the frequency that it is cited by other prominent alchemists— undoubtedly the most important passage from any alchemical work, period: C. Anne Wilson made the astounding discovery that the Greek verbs used in this passage—forms of nikēthen and karatēthen—were taken from Plato’s Timaeus 58d, where the Athenian was presenting Pythagorean views about the cycle of the four elements’ transformations.23 This is signifi cant because the most revered symbol of the Pythagoreans was the tetraktys, pictured below. The oath that the Pythagoreans swore over this symbol stated that the tetraktys represented “the fountain and roots of overfl owing nature.”24 For the followers of Pythagoras, the bottom row of four points represented earth, the row of three was water, two was air or aither, and one was fi re. The starting point for this tetraktys cosmology was the opposition between heaven and earth, the 1 and 4 of the tetraktys. Air and water were seen as the two mediating terms, sharing qualities with both fi re and earth. In fact, the process of elemental change as presented in the Timaeus shows a marked ambiguity toward earth in that the other three elements are composed of tetrahedra whose surfaces constitute 3-4-5 “perfect” triangles", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

However, this idea of earth as the odd element out does not hold if we observe the actual elemental cycle and its metallic aspect as put forth by Plato’s text. The Timaeus names copper, the earthy metal containing gold seeds (which seeds are kernels of solidifi ed aitherial fi re) as the starting point in the process that ends in a transformation of all the elements into the “1” at the top of the tetraktys.

Anne Wilson is worth citing at length here, since her speculative reconstruction of the Pythagorean-alchemical theory of transmutation complements nicely our earlier tentative sketch of what must have been going in the fi rst alchemical labs in Egypt: Copper represented earth on its way to becoming water. The people who compiled the chemical recipes knew how to obtain mercury and arsenic from their sulphides by vaporization processes which demonstrated that a gaseous or airy nature was concealed within the sulphide. They heated their copper petalon with mercury or arsenic in a sublimation vessel, and it emerged with a silvery appearance, thus representing water on its way to becoming air. It was then tinted gold by means of sulphur, sulphur water, yellow minerals and plant dyes in various combinations, and at this point may have represented air on its way to becoming fi re, but not yet fully fi re…. (-) Further treatment… brought the copper to its fi nal gold state when the element fi re became its predominant “nature.”25 Here the earth-and-metal copper is brought to a watery, soul-rich state via the sublimation process, wherein the airy, aitherial fumes from mercury and sulphur fi rst blacken the copper, then whiten it, making the latter a fi t receptacle (being pure and virgin, an ivory tabula rasa) for the fi ery color that evinces its passage into immutability, for, as one Vedic text has it, “gold is immortality and fi re is immortality.”26 The resultant metal, gold, as incarnated fi re and stabilized immutability, is aptly compared to the essence of the divine.

Humble copper, in the fi nal analysis, turns out to be the necessary counterpart to the fi ery “1,” the lowly earth—the cold and dark womb, Gaia—possessing the necessary female alter-energy that gives the fi ery male energy a space around which to coil and thus to develop its energies. In other words, the vision of aurifi cation presented in the Timaeus that is taken over and adapted in the fi rst alchemical text—Democritus’ Physika kai Mystika—is founded upon an explicitly Pythagorean/Orphic cosmology, symbolized by the most holy sign of the Pythagoreans, the tetraktys. The Physika’s key proverb—repeated incessantly in alchemical texts from the Leyden papyrus to Mary the Jewess and later Stephanos, Geber, and later European writers—speaks of natures fi rst rejoicing in natures, then of natures conquering natures, and lastly, of natures prevailing over natures; this formula seems to outline the ascent of the lowest form of fi re within earth through the watery grave of melted copper ore by the power of the aither (“fi ery air”) that burns away all imperfections, changing all of the lower natures—the bottom three tiers of the tetraktys: earth, water, and air— to the One that is all.27 Before taking a closer look at some of the inheritors of the alchemical tradition of Zosimos and Democritus, it behooves us to fi rst describe a master theme of Alexandrian alchemy that is also of utmost importance to a wide assortment of coeval mystical groups, be they Pythagoreans, Orphics, or even Gnostics. This alchemico-hermetic theme we will name, following C. Anne Wilson, “heavenly Hades.”28 We have to put aside our Christian preconceptions about heaven and hell for a moment to wrap our minds around this idea. What we have termed the “heavenly Hades” involves a view of the cosmos as a theatre wherein created beings can fi nd their true destinies by becoming united to the ever-present fi ery element—the fi re of Hades—that is itself divine and which is best defi ned as a fecund, energyrich substance where opposing forces—as in the Pythagorean “Table of Opposites”—meet. The seeker who taps into this divine fi re can see beyond his immediate physical and mental horizon, and can make soul journeys to spiritual realms, even attaining to unmediated communion with the divine.

Before going beyond this vignette to give a fuller picture of this alchemical idea of a divine Hades, I think it best to pause a moment to lay out a certain diffi culty that, if not faced now, will rear its head later, and cause confusions and uncertainties that will be well nigh impossible to dispel. In my studies of the texts of Western intellectual and religious history, I have found it rough going at times to determine the attitudes toward matter refl ected there. Ever since, as a young man, I fi rst read Arthur O. Lovejoy’s The Great Chain of Being, a book that contrasts Plato’s supposed “otherworldliness” with Aristotle’s purported “this-worldliness,” I have been dissatisfi ed with easy schematizations that paper over the ambiguities in this area, though I certainly understand that these schematics are necessary, and that there is much profi t in Lovejoy’s work. Indeed, I would be quite the philistine to think otherwise. Illustrative of the haze that surrounds this issue of whether or not Western philosophy sees the material world in a positive or negative light is a discussion I once had with a friend about Plotinus’s attitude toward matter. I castigated the author of the Enneads for his fl ight “from the alone to the Alone,” which, for me, indicated a devaluation of the world. My interlocutor responded that Plotinus’s attitude is not so one-sided, but rather is best understood as a holding together of two opposed perspectives in mind simultaneously: 1) From the perspective of the One, matter is a dark sink that is infi nitely distant from the divine, and thus is approached as inferior and even fi lthy; however, 2) from the point of view of the material realm per sé, matter is as perfect as it can be considering its ontological status as a kind of gauzy refl ection of the divine. Indeed, my Socratean friend intoned, the material world is a result of the glowing vessel of the godhead overfl owing itself because of its goodness. If the springing up of the fi nal and furthest-out ring—matter—constitutes the fi rst appearance of evil, this does not mean that matter itself is evil through and through. The ambiguity only grows when we consider that Plotinus, in the second Ennead, Book 9, rails against the Gnostics and their condemnation of the world and its matter as purely evil. In Part One I offer a more plainspoken critique of a broadly-conceived “Hellenistic anthropology,” which of course has a concomitant cosmology.

In Part One I offer a more plainspoken critique of a broadly-conceived “Hellenistic anthropology,” which of course has a concomitant cosmology. However, for our present purposes it is more fruitful to get inside the heads of the philosophers and alchemists who claimed to view matter as holy (since it originated in the divine), but who also spoke often of shedding the fetid husk of the body and the world it inhabits. That being said, I have to give a caveat concerning the idea of a divine Hades as it is presented in scholar Peter Kingsley’s writings (Kingsley’s work will be examined in detail below, with citations). According to Kingsley, Plato focuses on a purely immaterial realm that excludes the goodness of nature, and Aristotle reduces man’s inner life to a rationalistic faculty, denying the spiritual reality behind the world of appearances. Opposed to the dualism of Plato and the reductionism of Aristotle, in Kingsley’s mind, is the mystical monism of Parmenides and Empedocles. Without going into a protracted discussion, suffi ce to say that Kingsley retains what (at least to this writer) appears to be an ambiguous attitude to matter, though for Kingsley and others who share his mystical conceptions, this paradox is the whole point. For instance, Kingsley, in unpublished lectures, has stated that the world is an illusion and that the only reason we have bodies is to be able to move around and communicate with other beings, this function being necessary only because of this alien impediment called the world of space and time. However, at these same seminars, Kingsley scoffs at other mystics who seem to neglect the body in their conceptions of spiritual practice. Doubtless infl uenced by a fragment of Empedocles that seems to enjoin the seeker of wisdom to trust each of the senses equally and to strive to perceive the actual mode in which each perception is recorded in our minds.29 Kingsley advocates a kind of ascetical regimen that includes touching parts of one’s body (the specifi c example of which I am thinking is his suggestion, at a seminar, that those in the audience press their fi ngertips on their legs and buttocks and to create a kind of loop in the mind that turns back on the process of perception itself) and also involves solitary meditation of a particular stripe. An active effort to mentally trace the single process of perception as it fl ows through multiple senses is supposed to lead the seeker to distrust the senses as guides to truth but to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

As I hope this brief excursus shows, there are many problems with Kingsley’s division of ancient Greek philosophy into the mystical monists on one hand and everybody else on the other. But all of this is illustrative, for what we have in Kingsley is what we will see in much Hellenistic religious discourse: an emphasis upon process at the expense of exclusionary interpretations of categories such as person (“I am the person James and you are the person Roger”) and nature (physis; “The world’s physis is created, but the divine physis is uncreated”). What I have termed “exclusionary interpretation of categories” is held not only by Orthodox Christians and some non-Orthodox Christians, but is also held to (though in a radically different context than in Christianity) by some Manicheans and Muslims, and by others. Part 1 will spend time refi ning and developing the notions of process and category as they are evinced in alchemical texts, and fruitful comparisons will be made with Orthodox Christian views of the same themes. There are three main reasons Orthodox Christianity will be used in these pages as a foil to alchemy: 1) Orthodox Christianity existed as a widespread and dominant intellectual and religious paradigm throughout late antiquity; 2) the defi ning traits of alchemical thinking each have a matching counter-trait in Orthodoxy; and, further, 3) I am particularly qualifi ed to speak about the early history of Orthodoxy since I have done extensive research on the subject.30 Any discussion of the “heavenly Hades” cosmology has to contend with Peter Kingsley’s Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic, which irritated many in the academic community when it was published by Oxford’s Clarendon Press in 1995, an example being Jonathan Barnes’ entertaining but bizarre review, which concluded that Kingsley was a “roaring boy,” who “thumps his tub,” and “buckles his swash.”32 All of this perhaps indicates Kingsley’s headlong plunge into an idiosyncratic, mystical view of the history of Western philosophy. Kingsley gave detailed support for his thesis that Empedocles’ and Parmenides’ cosmology contrasts starkly with that of the supposed founders of Western thought—Plato, Aristotle and their followers.

Before Kingley’s book, most scholars believed that Empedocles and Parmenides (both 5th cen. B.C.) were more rationalistic than mystical in their thinking, the latter philosopher being touted as the “founder of logic” (which he certainly is, though the signifi cance given to the word “logic” in ancient texts is far from straightforward). But the heart of Empedocles’ philosophy, so Kingsley holds, is a rather Orphic belief that a central fi re blazes at the earth’s core, a fi re intent on making its way to the border of the cosmos, far above the Earth’s surface. Fire interacts with the subterranean waters and with the dark earth itself, creating hot springs and volcanoes, sites of holy worship since they literally are places where the heavenward forces of the cosmic hearth bubble up to the surface, the hearth-fi re being the universal catalyst par excellence. From the cosmos’s fi ery point of origin, it is not only streams of bright fl ame but also quickly hardening clouds of dark mist and earth that burst forth sporelike from the kernel’s earthen crust. This “Big Bang” is the cause of the material universe’s expansion in all directions from the central golden dot, the fi re (with other elements along for the ride in various proportions) stopping when it reached the spherical cosmic border. Thus Empedocles and his ilk saw the universe both as a great sphere of earth surrounded by aither, stars and sun; and also as a reaching out of fi re and fi re-bearing beings toward the celestial borders. The sun and stars are pieces of fi re that got trapped on the cosmic “glass” that is the outer shell of the World Egg, and the heavens that surround the celestial bodies are regions of glazed or crystallized aither.33 Humankind originated, according to Empedocles, from Hades, from below the surface of the Earth. The central fi re pushed the fi rst humans into the aither above the Earth. Later, when fi ery earth and water burst into the atmosphere, a mass of fi re—the sun—collected in the sky and thus light was shed upon the dark face of the Earth. (As a sidebar, also note Empedocles’ belief that the weight of the sun, which contained a disproportionate amount of fi re in a concentrated spot, actually tilted the whole cosmos slightly, and this accounts for the Earth’s axial tilt.)

To illustrate just how much Empedocles’ conception differs from that of the Judeo-Christian tradition (at least, the Judeo-Christian tradition as it is thought of in the West), let us translate the Empedoclean cosmology into Christian terms: God said, “Let there be light in the center of creation, and let this fi re of hell burst forth from the cold, dark earth, suffusing all things with its light and heat” (my phrase). This fi ery hearth cosmology contrasts with more dualistic worldviews that see matter, time and space as a result of a fall from grace. The Gnostics and many Neoplatonists held variants of the latter, decidedly otherworldly view, which may have originated (at least in its decisive articulation) in Plato’s doctrine of the “forms.” The Hellenistic notion of soma sema—the body is a tomb—seems to be akin to this dualistic, spirit-over-matter stance. Kingsley makes the assertion, unsettling for many, that this Empedoclean tradition was carried on in Greco-Egyptian alchemy and in its immediate successor, Arabic/Islamic alchemy. Once, when thought came to me of the things that are and my thinking soared high and my bodily senses were restrained, like someone heavy with sleep from too much eating or toil of the body, an enormous being completely unbounded in size seemed to appear to me and call my name and say to me: “What do you want to hear and see; what do you want to learn and know from your understanding?” Changed in aspect and suddenly everything opened before me in a moment and I saw a limitless vision, everything become light, serene and joyous, and at the sight I was smitten with love. And a little afterwards there was a darkness showing up below and coming in its turn, fearful and somber, which rolled in tortuous spirals like a snake, as it seemed to me. And this darkness changed into a sort of liquid nature, shaken in an indescribable manner and exhaling a vapour such as comes from fi re and producing a sort of noise, an unspeakable groaning. Then there jetted from it a voice of appeal, without articulation, such as I compared with a voice of [fi re].35 …Poimandres’ revelation starts with him undergoing a number of changes in appearance: he turns into light, then the light turns into dark, then the darkness turns into a watery, primal chaos.

(-) The light turns into darkness, fi re leaps up out of the darkness. Here is no radical dualism: in Greek philosophical terms it is more or less baffl ing, but what it does correspond to exactly is the fundamental, subtle and often highly ambiguous idea in ancient Egypt of cosmology mirroring the everyday disappearance and reappearance of the sun, with darkness in one sense the opposite of light but in another sense simply its primeval form.36 First, there is a startling correspondence between the stages of Poimandres’ bodily revelation—1) unbounded light, 2) serpentine darkness, and 3) luminous ascent—and the stages of alchemy—1) blackening, 2) whitening, and 3) yellowing. The initial light phase, where “everything became light, serene and joyous,” runs parallel to the starting point of alchemy, which presupposes spiritual preparation and enlightenment before any laboratory work commences. Next comes the blackening phase of alchemical operations, counterpart to Poimandres’ light-to-dark change, which is presented—in both “Poimandres” and in alchemical texts—as the coiling of a serpent, the resulting circle constituting a space scissioned off from the uncreated (and thus divine!) prime matter, as a passage from the Egyptian Coffi n Texts has it: “I bent right around myself, I was encircled in my coils, one who made a place for himself in the midst of his coils.”37 The “Poimandres” describes this blackening phase as a liquefaction of the dark matter, the mass being “shaken in an indescribable manner and exhaling a vapour such as comes from fi re and producing a sort of noise, an unspeakable groaning.” This is an obvious use—in a central text of Hermeticism, no less—of the semantic fi eld of alchemy to symbolize the genesis and development of both the soul of man and the cosmos he inhabits, for it is the alchemical furnace that trembles, the moaning “noise” being the purring of steam or other fumes escaping the hermetically sealed alembic. Next comes the leaping up of the fl aming voice, the “voice of appeal, without articulation.” This image of the third and fi nal stage as a returning of the fi re, not a boundless light as in the fi rst phase, but rather a fl ame from the depths of the seeker’s soul, to the heights of heaven is probably a reference to the ancient teaching about celestial archons. The archons, in a cosmology that is found as early as Babylon and Egypt and which continues straight up to the Gnostics and alchemists of late antiquity, are the gatekeepers of the planetary spheres, and much Gnostic/mystery cult music seems to have been a rehearsal of passwords necessary for the initiate to get", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Interestingly, each archon was associated with a particular 1) musical tone, 2) vowel (one of the seven in Greek), 3) color, and 4) metal. Also, each toll-house being passed, the ascending Gnostic sheds a particular vice or passion associated with it. At the top of the key, the seventh guard post passed, the seeker is totally free of the evil of matter. The fl aming voice is a cry because it is a song; it is an appeal because it is a password revealing the seeker’s true home in heaven; it is “without articulation” because the pure music of the spheres is noetic [of the intellect], not perceptible by fl eshly ears. Gold is the highest thing, the hue of gods’ fl esh, totally spiritualized life force, since “the fi re assimilates all hard and solid objects to subtle and luminous bodies….”38 However, there does seem to be a tension here between the Pythagorean and alchemical notion of a black sun, or central hearth—a notion that comes from Orphism as well as from whatever ancient beliefs preceded Orphism— and the idea of heaven at the top of the sky—a concept that goes back to Babylonian and Egyptian cosmologies, and even further to the previously mentioned idea of a top layer of the sky made of crystallized aither. The ambiguity, I believe, comes from the double meaning of “black sun.” On the one hand, black sun seems to describe the “paradox of destructive force being converted into creative power;”39 that is, the dual aspect of the unitary process of development, operative on the micro and macro levels. On the other hand, it refers to a stage in the divine process, the coiling of the serpent back onto itself, onto its own unlimited essence. It is as if the divine, intentionally or unintentionally, falls into darkness by carving out a vector of space/time and allowing some of the infi nite properties that exist potentially in prime matter to manifest themselves. However, we also have a literal central fi re, a hearth or One (Gr. pan), out of which fl ows, if we follow Alexander Polyhistor, individual beings made up of the four elements, the latter tetrad composed of limiteds and unlimiteds in some wise or another.40 (Plato’s Timaeus may have been an attempt to bring some mathematical order to these somewhat discombobulated proceedings.)", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Though there is a cycle of elements, the fi re heating the subterranean waters, the waters and earth bursting into the air, etc., do all things end up back at the hearth, or do they escape into the highest realm beyond the glazed fi re above? If we focus upon the earliest Pythagorean texts, we fi nd the teaching that the central fi re is a kind of creator of all things that weaves pieces of the prime matter—the so-called “limiteds” and “unlimiteds”—into harmonies. Confusing the matter is the fact that the hearth or One is itself the fi rst thing created out of prime matter (Who created this hearth/One?). What’s more, not all the prime matter was used in making the cosmos, just the unlimiteds nearest the heart at the cosmos’ creation. The One breathed in, drawing the unlimiteds into a harmonious relation with the limiteds that were lying around. Thus, the ambiguous status of hearth and heaven in Pythagoreanism originated in some idiosyncrasies of the Orphic cosmos. For the Orphics, the hearth at the center of the cosmos was identifi ed with the outer rim of the sky, the “castle of Zeus.”41 Phanes, the golden boy hatched from the Orphic World Egg, took up residence in the furthest cosmic rim. Where, indeed, is heaven and hell? Pythagorean moral teaching advised self-limitation as an active mirroring— on the level of morality and ascesis—of the natural (that is to say, material) harmony that exists at the cosmic and the individual level. Mixed in was an Eastern notion of reincarnation, one that involved certain exceptional persons ascending to a divine realm beyond the material world. This ascent mirrors the path up to the fi ery air at the top of the cosmos, farthest from the earth. Perhaps this, for lack of a better term, Hermetic cosmology is best summed up in the words of an actual initiate of the time, a certain Lucius: It ascends from Earth to Heaven, then again descends to Earth, And receives the powers of things above with things below. Thus thou shalt possess the glory of the whole world, And all obscurity shall fl ee from thee.

That which I had to say regarding the operation of the sun is completed.43 The earliest version of this most famous of alchemical tracts is in Arabic, and may date from the time of the composition of the Koran. Some scholars have recognized that this text probably has a Greek original, and that it may have been composed by alchemists in the time of Zosimos. Considering the content of the Emerald Table, whose author is unknown, I am at once struck at its emphasis upon “adaptatione,” or adaptation as the power of all powers. The tale here is not one of heavenly powers that thunder down on a pitiful creation. Rather, creation itself, the process that resulted in all of existence, is available to the alchemist. The method is given in the Table, though obscurely so: Harness the fi re of the furnace to slowly burn away the earth from the gold, using of course the sulphur/mercury kerotakis process which we have described previously. “Its power is perfect if it is turned into earth.” Obviously, we are dealing here with an earth that has fi re in it, separated from the earth with no fi re in it. This may be a reference to the “red sulphur” which became the focus of Islamic alchemy in the seventh century and after. Also of note is the idea in the Table that reality is divided into an upper and a lower level, and that the “power of powers,” “adaptation,” comes about by the joining up of the upper and lower realms’ complementary powers. Here we have the two properties necessary for divine development: 1) uncreatedness, and 2) multi-level self-emanation. The “One” here is perhaps all-powerful, but instead of being locked into “the Alone,” the One rather fl ows outward, like a caged divine Bull giving Itself room to rear. Compare this central alchemical theme to the words of Zosimos: This is the divine and great mystery, the object of research, because this is the All. Two natures, (but) only one substance, because one attracts the other and one dominates the other. This is the silvery water, the hermaphrodite, which constantly fl ees, which hurries toward the proper realities; it is the divine water that all have ignored, whose nature is diffi cult to conceive.

Indeed, it is not a metal, nor a water always in movement, nor a body (solid), because one cannot seize it. It is the universal in all things, because it at once possesses life and spirit, as well as a destructive power. The one who understands it possesses both gold and silver.44 So, the creative side of things is perhaps easier to grasp than the “destructive” side. What is destroyed in making the “silvery water,” which the Table calls a miraculous “earth”? Perhaps it can be understood when relating it to the two qualities that seem to be necessary in the alchemical “gold,” 1) liquidity, and 2) fi xity. In other words, the substance created by alchemy must both adequately contain power and also transfer this same power to the alchemist as well as to other substances. As Maria the Jewess put it: “If you do not demetalize metals and do not metallize the unmetals and make the two one, nothing expected happens.”45 As we fl ash forward to later Byzantine alchemy, specifi cally the seventh century, we encounter writers such as Stephanos of Alexandria, whose famous lectures on alchemy, which were quoted incessantly by many later practitioners in Arabic and in Latin, included a tetrad of poems from which the following was excerpted: By linking soul to body in one bond, Th[r]ough perfect combination of the two The ‘Sacred Art’ makes both to live as one, When spirit comes a third to crown the whole.

All good and fi ne, I concede, but we all know the problems Cartesius’ infamous gland presents. Is it physical or mental, a thing of spirit or a thing of atoms?

The scholarly consensus is that “Democritus” is not the author of Physika kai Mystika, though no one has, in my mind, brought forth any convincing evidence that proves exactly who the author was. Regardless, I have refrained from entering into this obscure scholarly controversy, though I agree that Democritus of Abdera (see Glossary entry) was not the author. One advantage to foregoing any fruitless (for our purposes) discussion of the authorship of the Physika will be our avoiding confusing and unwieldy names such as “pseudo-Democritus” or “Ps.-Democritus.” For a discussion of some of the issues involved in the Physika authorship question, see Jackson P.

The question of the relationship of alchemy to the Eastern Roman Empire and its Orthodox Civilization is a tangled one. There is not a large enough sample size of texts from the Eastern Roman Empire that deal with alchemy to draw any meaningful conclusions. In the Suda it is written that “Diocletian, having sought out the books on this subject, burned them. Now, because of the revolutions, Diocletian treated the Egyptians harshly and cruelly and having sought out these books written by their forefathers on the chemistry of gold and silver, burned them lest wealth should accrue to the Egyptians through this art and lest they, emboldened by riches, should in the future revolt against the Romans” (Cited in Grimes, Zosimus, 43). As anyone can ascertain, this passage tells us nothing decisive about Diocletian’s beliefs about or attitudes toward alchemy, since fi scal control would be a suffi cient cause of this Imperial ban.

At the end of our introduction we found ourselves in seventh century Egypt, where we examined a snippet from the pen of Stephanos of Alexandria. We did not mention, however, that Stephanos dedicated his famed lectures to Heraclius (ca. 575 – 641 A.D.), the Roman Emperor whose ecumenist policies raised the hackles of many in the Church. Heraclius was by all accounts friendly to a wide range of ideas, and was interested in philosophy as well as theology.

Thus, in tracing the forward path of alchemy from its Egyptian beginnings to its arrival in Medieval Europe (by way of Islamic texts in Spain), we are obliged to add another variable to our already crowded equation—Christian theology. But that is far from all. By the thirteenth century, during which alchemy became widespread in Western Europe, there was a plurality of Christian Churches—1) the Eastern or Greek Orthodox, 2) the Roman Catholic, and 3) the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Herein lay quite a tale, which, due to space constraints, we must squash into a vignette. Though the Oriental Orthodox Churches (or at least some individual prelates from those Churches) had a hand in transmitting alchemy to the Arab world (and thus indirectly to Europe), as many of their theologians and clergymen fl ed to the Far East in the aftermath of the Fourth Ecumenical Council (451 A.D.), bringing their Greco-Egyptian alchemical knowledge with them. In the aftermath of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787 A.D.) of the Christian Church, which promulgated the Orthodox teaching that icons are necessary to Christianity and must be venerated, we see the Frankish Church under Charlemagne (ca. 742 – 814 A.D.) holding its own national church council. At this Council of Frankfurt (794 A.D.), Charlemagne condemned both the position of the iconodules (venerators of icons) and that of the iconoclasts (those against icons). The Franks were that martial Teutonic group who took over many positions of power in Europe once the Western Roman Empire became only a memory in the hearts of many a Gallo-Roman. The Council of Frankfurt has been cited by many scholars of ecclesiastical history as an example of Charlemagne’s ingenious penchant for geopolitical scheming, his goal being, it seems clear, to keep Rome and the West separated from the Christian East. Why else condemn both sides of the icon controversy? The Frankfurt council steered a middle path by upholding the use of icons but also condemning their veneration! No matter which side prevailed on the Eastern front, Charlemagne could then declare the winning group heretical. All that was needed was a distinctive theology that could be forced on a weak Pope, and then the job of divide and conquer was completed. The trump card was the fi lioque. That Charlemagne’s goal was to pressure the papacy into accepting his idiosyncratic “Frankish theology”3 is evinced by the controversy that resulted in the early ninth century concerning the fi lioque clause that the Franks had added", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

That Charlemagne’s goal was to pressure the papacy into accepting his idiosyncratic “Frankish theology”3 is evinced by the controversy that resulted in the early ninth century concerning the fi lioque clause that the Franks had added to the Nicene Creed. When the Creed was chanted at the Frankish palace at Aachen, the Holy Spirit was professed to proceed from both the Father and the Son (fi lioque). Charlemagne tested the religiopolitical waters by sending a group of his fi lioque-chanting monks to Jerusalem, where some Greek Christians who happened along were scandalized at hearing the interpolated Creed. A certain John led a kind of Christian commando raid on the Latin monastery. Psalters were confi scated and the fi lioque declared a heresy by the offended Greeks. Shocked Latin monastics (surely with Charlemagne’s knowledge) wrote to Pope Leo III. They meekly inquired of the Holy Father: Are the Greeks right in calling us heretics? Pope Leo later declared that it was not proper to change the Nicene Creed, which did not originally contain the Greek equivalent to the Latin “fi lioque,” “and the Son.” This problem of papal infl exibility was solved when the Franks realized that they could manipulate papal elections behind the scenes. Charlemagne’s descendents, following their forefather’s stratagem, succeeded in getting the fi lioque offi cially accepted in Rome by 1009, and even took over the papacy itself during the “time of the German popes” in the middle of the eleventh century.4 In 1054, the papal representative Cardinal Humbert hurled a bull of excommunication at the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Kerularius and others besides. This greatest of schisms continues up to today: Orthodoxy in the East and Roman Catholicism in the West. In order to come to grips with the subtleties of fi lioquist theology, we will now take a close look at the famous pictogram known since the Carolingian era as the “Shield of Faith” (fi g. 1). This fi gure, the earliest examples of which date to just before Charlemage’s reign, was intended to express the Christian West’s religious faith in the Holy Trinity. It consists of three circles arranged in a triangular pattern, each circle bearing the name of a Divine Person—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In the center of the triangle is a fourth circle, one labeled simply “God.”5 Most signifi cant for our purposes is the fact that some versions of the “Shield of Faith” place the Holy Spirit at the bottom of the fi gure, below the horizontally positioned Father and Son, both of whom occupy an upper corner of the top-heavy triangle.

This aspect of the diagram is meant to indicate the dual origin of the Holy Spirit, Who, in Western Christianity, is believed to proceed from the Father and the Son (fi lioque). Farrell comments: “…[I]t may come as a surprise to many people [that] the doctrine which came to prevail in the mediaeval Latin Church was not the original Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which survived only in the Orthodox Catholic Churches of the East.”6 While it is not our immediate purpose to argue for or against a particular religious creed, it does behoove us to recognize that the fi lioquist Trinity was fi rst ratifi ed as dogma in the Christian West by Charlemagne’s national church councils in the late eighth and early ninth centuries.Also, we should realize the little known fact that the original Christian Creed—the Nicene-Constantinopolitan—is still proclaimed by the Christian East though not by the Western Churches, who added the words “and the Son,” to the original “I believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth from the Father.”7 Western Trinity is really “two and one,” two Persons and their one common energy. Indeed, the Holy Spirit depicted on the “Shield” is a mere pseudoperson, since He (or, more accurately for the fi lioquist West, It ) exists merely as the activity of the other two Persons. The Holy Spirit is the “bond of love” between the Father and the Son; the Spirit is an activity, while the others are fully-fl edged Persons who possess their own activity, which activity turns out to be none other than the ghostly Third Person Himself. So how does the fi lioquist Trinity relate to alchemy? Both are based upon what Farrell calls a “dialectic of oppositions,” a cast of thought that sees the world as a vast system of binaries, each side of every individual dichotomy being defi ned by its opposition to its counterpart. The spirit is only spirit because it is opposite to matter, and so on. This dialectical mindset predetermines, in both fi lioquism and alchemy, that a peculiar line of thought —a specifi c methodological contour—will be followed. The best way to illustrate the similarity between the Filioquists’ and the alchemists’ approach to reality, I am convinced, is to start from the end and work our way backward.

In other words, because both groups think alike and are thereby led to the same series of conclusions, we will fi rst list those conclusions. Then, we will fl esh out our comparison with a brief examination of relevant historical evidence. First the list of Franco-alchemic “conclusions”: Now, with these conclusions in mind, let us now return to that most elusive of texts, the Corpus Hermeticum. In the introduction, we sought to demonstrate that the Hermetic writings overlapped, in content and in approach, with Greco-Egyptian alchemy. Here our aim is to show the alchemico-hermetic writings’ similarity to the distinctive theological formulations of the post-Charlemagnian West. Of what magnitude then must be that Space in which the Kosmos is moved? And what of nature? Must not that Space be far greater, that it may be able to contain the continuous motion of the Kosmos, and that the thing moved may not be cramped through want of room, and cease to move?—(Asclepius): Great indeed must be that Space, Trismegistus. —(Hermes): And of what nature must it be, Asclepius? Must it not be of opposite nature to Kosmos? And of opposite nature to body is the incorporeal…. Space is an object of thought, but not in the same sense that God is, for God is an object of thought primarily to himself, but Space is an object of thought to us, not to itself.”9 The Hermetic trinity presented here—God, Space, Cosmos—has for its middle term “Space” (topos). Like St. Augustine’s fi lioquist Holy Spirit, Who is nothing more than what is common between the Father and the Son (See St. Augustine, De Trinitate, 15.1), the Hermetic topos is the tangent between the God Who cannot be conceived and the Cosmos that is God’s utter and total opposite. 1) Space is the soul of the 2) Cosmos-body, both 1 and 2 being opposed one to another as oil to water. However, the principle of opposition itself, viewed from another angle, becomes a connection between God and Cosmos, for Space as the object of Cosmos’ thought is analogous to God as the object of His own thought. Put differently: Cosmos becomes selfconscious through its own soul; God is always conscious through his own essence. Man and the World Soul achieve fi nitely what God is always achieving infi nitely.

This seemingly harmless notion of theanthropic analogy is one of the most portentous formulations in the history of religion, for it allows, mutatis mutandis [that is, given the appropriate adjustments of terminology], for a Christian mysticism of a beatifi c vision of God’s essence. The God/world/man analogy has not only survived the twists and turns of the Middle Ages and the upheavals of the Modern Era, but in fact thrives as the offi cial theology of the Roman Catholic Church, most recently affi rmed at the Second Vatican Council. Some form of analogia entis [analogy of being] is also commonly held by other groups of Western Christians.10 Herein lay the great signifi cance of the “Shield of Faith” and its alchemicohermetic basis: The theology of the “Shield” is grounded in the same analogia entis that undergirds both the Western theology of beatifi c vision and the esotericism of the cosmic analogy trinity. Hermeticism, alchemy, and Western Christianity are in complete accord on this most crucial of dogmas: God possesses in an infi nite measure every virtue that man possesses fi nitely. According to the Orthodox Fathers of the Church, theology’s proper beginning point is not any concept of God, however intellectually satisfying or emotionally compelling such an idea may be. Rather, the Orthodox begin with the reality of the Incarnation of Christ, the Son of God. “God became man that man may become as God.”11 The Son is the perfect image of God the Father. We know that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three divine Hypostases or Persons because those masters of the spiritual life who have become united to the Holy Trinity in this life all report the same thing: They have become united to the Holy Trinity through a sharing in the divine resplendence or glory (Gr. doxa), which, though being from Three, is also One. However, Orthodox spiritual life has nothing in common with individualism or pietism, for no one can baptize himself, and no one can be perfected apart from the communal life of the Divine Liturgy. One begins as a hearer, as a babe who must begin with milk before he can have solid food. The milk is the opening stages of ascesis in the form of 1) obedience to a spiritual father who is a doer, one who teaches from experience of God, and 2) participation in the Holy Sacraments of the Church, the Sacrament par excellence being the Holy Eucharist, where the communicant receives the Body and Blood of God into his body.

The higher stage that constitutes “solid food” is direct experience of the uncreated glory of God, though the friend of God never rises above the need for repentance and the Sacraments, but rather lives out these aspects of Orthodox life more fully. Such a communion, far from being magical, is in actuality the only Way (Heb. Torah) that delivers man from idolatry: “There are two ways, one of life and one of death.” “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”12 So, if man does not come to know God through concepts, then how does man ever know God at all? Man is created in the image of God, which means that his life is meant to be an eternal journey toward the divine. This journey is possible because man’s center is his God-created nous, or inner man (eso anthropon).13 The nous is never equated with the brain or the rational mind (dianoia) by the Orthodox Fathers; it is precisely this confusion of the noetic with the merely rational that characterizes the Augustino-Platonic tradition of the Christian West. The nous is also designated as the heart (kardia) by the Orthodox Fathers.14 This spiritual heart is man’s unique organ of communion with the uncreated energies of God. These energein of God are not a part of God, nor are they an intermediary between man and God. Neither are God’s energies anything other than the very Life, Light, and Love of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. These energies are God’s going out of Himself toward creation in an act of love (kenosis, self-emptying) to save creation from corruption through communion with His incorrupt life. The recipient of God’s energies does not receive a part of God, because God is not composite, but rather man receives the body of Christ, which is a mystico-noetic—and for that very reason eminently realistic—communication of the life of the Holy Trinity.15 Nor are the divine energies anhypostatic, but rather are the true resplendence of God, distinguished from the divine essence but not separate from it. The suffusion of the divine energies throughout all of creation is the overfl owing of divine love.

This descent of the Hand of God into the heart of man is the new thing under the sun for which St. Solomon, the prophets, and all of the sages of every era have pined. God divides Himself undividedly to enter the heart of each and every man who will co-operate with Him to perfect selfl ess love therein. Accordingly, the true signifi cance of man being “in the image of God” is that man has been created already conformed to God in such a way that he can—with the aid and sustenance of divine grace, that is, synergistically and ascetically—love in the exact way that God loves His creation, that is, freely and selfl essly (the only difference being that man is not uncreated by nature, as is the Holy Trinity, but rather man becomes uncreated by grace or energy).16 Strictly speaking, only Christ is the Image of God; man is the image of the Image. There is a dual aspect of the image of God in man: Man was created in the image and likeness of God. The image of God in man, considered by itself, is a given, for Christ, the Second Adam, through His Incarnation reconstituted the human nature shared by every man. However, the “likeness of God” is not a given, but rather is a task, a Way to be followed, to be lived within. Man transcends himself non-dialectically by emptying himself of all self-concern and eudaemonia [well-being] through a co-working with God’s uncreated grace, a grace that is not opposed to creation. It bears repeating: God’s uncreated glory does not coerce creation into acting as a God-serving automaton, but rather ceaselessly calls man (the little cosmos) and all of creation (the big cosmos) into a deeper and deeper union with Him, “from glory to glory.”17 Because the teachings of the Church Fathers are not conditioned by the dubious logic of the “dialectic of oppositions,” they can, without any inconsistency, proclaim that God’s Hand (his energies) can come down to the heart of man without any resultant development or division in the Godhead. The experience of the Orthodox Fathers of the Church is identical to that of the friends of God of the Old Testament. For example, the Three Holy Children—St. Shadrach, St. Mechach, and St. Abednego—were seen in the fi ery furnace with a fourth Person, the Lord of Glory (Christ) who suffered there with them, sustaining them through His grace. Likewise, St. Solomon, standing in the Holy of Holies of the newly-consecrated Temple, marveled that God could at the same time be both beyond and above all of creation, and also come and dwell between the cherubim atop the Ark of the Covenant.18 Unlike the Hellenistic/hermetic tradition, which posits an analogy between the life", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

To state things starkly, the Orthodox view of man begins with God and views man as an icon of the Godman without any rationalistic analogy being allowed. Orthodox anthropology is thus Hebraic rather than Hellenistic.19 In keeping with its Hellenistic basis, the Gnostic anthropology of hermeticism takes man as its starting point: An intuitive feeling—“the call”—provides the Gnostic with an unquestionable certitude that he or she is actually a part of God, albeit a lower emanation of Him.20 Starting from his human fear of extinction and his desire for self-fulfi llment and immortality, the Gnostic projects his eudaemonistic passions into the divine sphere: Man ceases to be a willing subject distinct from other persons and becomes himself a theo-cosmological process which allows God to know Himself.21 Put succinctly, there are three levels in the Gnoseo-hermetic scheme: 1) Anthropos (Man), 2) Cosmos (World), and 3) Theos (God). All three of these levels are God, though the fi rst two are lower emanations or manifestations of the divine essence.22 The foregoing discussion of the Orthodox and hermetic anthropologies is shown to have a great relevance for alchemy if we refocus our attention on the Orthodox and hermetic attitudes toward matter. For the Orthodox, God created the world “very good,” and He also created the world in such a way that its material sphere—its matter—is conformable to the incorruption of the noetic realm, the realm of God’s uncreated glory. Most importantly, matter is made to be imbued with God’s life, not as something foreign to it, but as its own true telos; in this sense, to speak of the alchemical process of changing matter into spirit is inhuman and docetistic,23 involving the obliteration of creation rather than its deifi cation. With the creation of man, matter and nous/spirit were shown for what they truly are: perfective, nonopposed creations of God which, forever entwined, are intended to ascend from non-defective goodness to greater and greater levels of perfection in God’s energies, which energies are His very life.24 To safeguard the path to union with God and to avoid idolatry and blasphemy, the Orthodox Fathers of the Church distinguished three categories that apply both to the uncreated and to the created: By contrast, the Gnoseo-hermetic", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

These “ideas” are incorporeal, unchanging and rational. Since an ideal/real oppositional dialectic is presupposed, two superfi cially distinct cosmological attitudes result: Some gnoseo-hermetic texts denigrate matter as an evil cesspool ruled by demons, while others hold the world to be good. However, even the seemingly positive Gnostic assessment of the world is just another form of matter-hatred (docetism26), since what is held to be “good” in the world is what is hidden within or behind matter. In other words, matter is a husk, an unreal shadow that contains (or hides) “good” reality.27 The cellophane wrapper is good because one can see through it to the candy it contains. We all know what happens to the wrapper afterwards. Hopefully the underlying dialectic of oppositions is recognized here, in that motion, matter and unreality is here being opposed to stasis, form and reality. The dualism of this gnoseo-hermetic view of matter complements the “process dualism” (my term) which lies behind the alchemical trinity. The latter is the yin-yang dualism of “two contrary principles” of which Tenney L. Davis writes, and to which we above alluded. In the following section our examination of alchemical trinitarian imagery will attempt to illustrate how these two dualisms interact in medieval textual illustrations. In Taiquing, the earliest tradition of Chinese alchemy, “the central act of the alchemical process consists in causing matter to revert to its state of ‘essence’ (jing), or prima materia.”28 Historically, Indian mysticism, which may have gotten its core transmutational ideas from Chinese alchemy, has sought out ascetic techniques for reversing the cosmological process that caused the differentiation of souls from the original essence, bráhman. From the seventh century (and possibly before) we see idiosyncratic forms of alchemical theory and practice in India, though some of its main features indicate a direct dependence upon Chinese alchemical precedent.29 As we have seen, Greco-Egyptian alchemy’s Ouroboros (tail-biting serpent) image represents the paradoxical nature of alchemical transmutation, which is both a return to the undifferentiated liquid of primordial chaos, and at the same time a move forward and upward to an aetherial heaven. Though other notions take center stage from time to time in alchemy’s varied history, evidence of the prima materia concept is ubiquitous, not just in Greco-Egyptian alchemy, but also in Islamic and European alchemy, where transmutation strips", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Though other notions take center stage from time to time in alchemy’s varied history, evidence of the prima materia concept is ubiquitous, not just in Greco-Egyptian alchemy, but also in Islamic and European alchemy, where transmutation strips matter of its qualities or balances out its elements, humors, or properties. In an attempt to formulate a typology that applies to each of the types of transmutation listed above, scholar Joseph P. Farrell has written about alchemy as a scientio-theurgic technique of “back engineering” wherein the process of God’s emanation of the cosmos from an original uncreated prime material can be reenacted.30 This human repetition of cosmic creation seems to promise the alchemist the power to do anything to the physical medium that God can do. In other words, the power to do anything, anywhere is the glittering prize of the Great Work. The question might here be raised as to why we rarely see claims to such absolute power in alchemical texts. One reason is that alchemy, as a sacred science, in most cases conceives of the would-be alchemist as a holy man or ascetic whose personal humility and worthiness is a prerequisite for any transmutation to occur.31 So, the alchemical writings exhibit, not a mere lust for wealth, but rather a search for prima materia—the primal, uncreated, undifferentiated embodied matter which can inject a deifi c transmuting power into material bodies (especially persons).32 We should not, however, excise the gold out of the picture, since many alchemists were concerned with producing it, though this aim usually did not exclude the cosmic control notion. It follows logically that alchemy—a specifi c practice or way toward a specifi c objective—is based upon a specifi c cosmology, physics, and theology. Farrell’s summation of this alchemical worldview is particularly apt: …[A]ll of the existing diversity of the universe stemmed from one underlying “prime matter” or materia prima, an absolutely undifferentiated substrate, an “aether” or medium which then began to undergo differentiation. This initial process of “hyper-differentiation” of an undifferentiated medium Schwaller called the “primary scission.” Further differentiations are in turn performed upon these initial derivations from the medium, until at last the entire diversity of creation arises. While all this sounds rather fanciful, it is in fact capable of a profoundly sophisticated interpretation from the point of view of certain aspects of modern physics, for an absolutely undifferentiated substrate in fact is physically non-observablee; it is therefore, as far as physics is concerned, a nothing, even though it may be said that this materia prima has some sort of “existence.”33 Farrell goes on to note that this materia prima, as the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

One had, so to speak, to ‘back engineer’ the whole process of differentiations.”35 Think of Democritus’ The implications of the foregoing defi nition of alchemy are breathtaking. First and foremost, the Farrellian notion of alchemy as a practical path to domination of the cosmos through a transmutation of created material into uncreated material provides decisive support for recent alchemy scholarship that concerns itself with the practical, “laboratory” side of alchemy, though Farrell’s backing-up job is so effective that it ends up revealing many limitations built into a merely “practical” approach that would leave out the mystical side of things. In their effort to approach alchemy from the perspective of a chemical science done in the laboratory, many take as their prime target C.G. Jung and his followers. Jung believed that alchemist’s real concern—though they may not be fully conscious of it—was to reach a higher spiritual state, to complete the process Jung calls “individuation.” The color changes the alchemist witnessed in the alembic, Jung believed, corresponded to the alchemist’s inner, spiritual changes. In other words, the alchemist thought he was looking at real changes in the material in the ambix, but he was really projecting his inner epiphanies and breakthroughs onto the matter in the vessel. This view of alchemy is very popular among mystics who accept Jung’s a priori notions of a “collective unconscious” and “individuation,” but they are unconvincing or even incomprehensible to everyone else. One is reminded of Joseph Campbell’s fascinating studies of world mythology that assume from the get-go that a certain type of hero is found in most or all world myths. These studies amass detail after detail to support their thesis of an archetypal myth, but have come in for devastating criticism for ignoring an equally large body of evidence that directly contradicts their pat typologies.

The latter approach is that of Lawrence Principe and William Newman, whose works explain away the mystical language and goals explicitly stated by most alchemists, the goal of their irresponsibly biased approach, it may be supposed, being to cut God and spirituality out of the alchemical picture.38 However, we wish to go beyond merely pointing out the obvious shortcomings of these otherwise gifted intellectuals’ work on the history and pre-history of chemistry. Principe and Newman, doubtless frustrated with lackluster, ungrounded studies of alchemy (writings inspired by Jung’s bizarre theories as well as by earlier 19th century precursors) which see the Great Work as a spiritual quest having no truck with the laboratory, nonetheless fail to fi nd the kind of interpretive balance achieved by scholars such as Joseph P. Farrell, Chiara Crisiani and Bruce T. Moran.39 For the latter grouping of scholars, alchemy is a spiritual quest that does not exclude the laboratory operations—the physical chemistry; alchemy is seen as a kind of liturgical performance that is at once spiritual and scientifi c. Moreover, it is assumed by this more broadminded group of scholars that various socio-religious contexts are intertwined within both the language used by the alchemists themselves as well as within the alchemists’ explicitly stated theories. No such balance is found in Principe and Newman, who dismiss the alchemico-hermetic imagery as mere “expressions of period piety, imprecations to God, [or] exhortations to morality.”40 Strangely enough, in one of their essays Principe and Newman actually go on to admit that their physicalist interpretation is inadequate, though they backtrack abruptly at the last minute, laying responsibility for their immoderate claims at the feet of the equally radical New Agers and their spiritualist forebears: “This is not to say that there was nothing whatsoever akin to a ‘spiritual alchemy’ in the broad historical spectrum of alchemy. The relationship between alchemy and religion, theology, and spirituality is complex, but still does not countenance the esoteric spiritual school of interpretation.”41 Besides its historical inaccuracy, Principe and Newman’s attempt to despiritualize the thousands of documents that comprise the literature of alchemy comes frightfully close to dismissing the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Not too long ago, this kind of reductionism in science led Michael Polanyi to decry it as a new form of “bigotry” akin to that of religious fundamentalism.42 It could be argued that Farrell’s interpretation of the history of alchemy does what many previous commentators, trapped in either radical spiritualism or radical scientism, have consistently failed to do, for Farrell provides a logically consistent explanation of alchemy which accounts for its continued existence (and possible success43, in some cases) without turning its practitioners into proto-psychologists or into disinterested chemists in white coats who care nothing for the frock of spirituality or the scepter of power.44 Examples in the primary literature that are diffi cult to fi t into either the Jungian “strictly spiritual” approach or the Principean “strictly metallurgical” approach abound, each giving credence to Farrell’s (and other recent scholars’) more sensible approach. I cannot resist a short list of facts that serve to refute Principe and Newmans’ sanitized view of alchemy: 3. Roger Bacon, in 13th century England, saw alchemy as a means to determine the characters of individuals and also whole races of people. This would be accomplished, according to Bacon, through alchemical medicines that alter the moral make-up of human beings by overcoming astrally-determined “complexions” that cast a baleful glow over certain races that inhabit certain regions of the globe. The end result, Bacon thought, was an alchemically engineered conversion of the races to the Roman Church!45 Thus, Bacon’s Catholicism and his alchemy constitute a seamless whole, alchemy being the scientifi c answer to the religious problem of the conversion of the races to the Roman Church. . A European alchemist from the generation after Bacon, John of Rupescissa (d. 1366), considered alchemical processes to be directly related to his apocalyptic theory of history. For John, alchemical elixirs could extend human life because they were literally “human heaven.” William Newman’s work on Bacon tries to frame John of Rupescissa’s alchemy as an oddball occurrence which preceded a supposed “religious turn” during the generation or so following Bacon.46 Yet many of the earliest European alchemical texts—I am thinking of Michael Scot and his Ars Alchemie—mention Hermes by name and speak of transmutation in mystical terms, this fact of course casting serious doubt on Newman’s generalization.

One scholar in particular affords a convincing interpretive structure wherein the source material can be assessed. His positions on history and art, while remaining bold and insightful, nevertheless manage to avoid the unsightly extremes of New Age and Newman. His name is Syed Mahdihassan, and to his work we now turn our attention. Syed Mahdihassan, in his explorations of perennial symbols and in his retelling of the origins of alchemy in herbalism, contends that man’s historical fi xation on gold is best explained in terms of his early animistic worldview.47 The operative category in this animism is “soul,” a concept that despite (or perhaps because of) its vagueness serves as a principle of continuity for early man. This continuity gives man the comforting knowledge that power over the spatial and temporal dimensions is accessible to him. For the faint of heart, it may confer a deep feeling of communion by connecting the individual’s personal soul with that of other persons. Ancient man extends this sense of being enmeshed in a web of souls to the cosmic and the divine spheres by ancient man, where differing gradations of soul are manifested. Soul is life, but since: 4. this sliding scale of cosmic soul is central to man’s spiritual (transcendental) aspiration because it is connected to a kind of scientifi c process (which will be outlined and analyzed below).48 If Mahdihassan is correct then early man’s animism is not the result solely of irrational fears, nor is it pure fantasy. Rather, animism is a creative interpretation of a series of facts that are central to early man’s mode of existence.49 To restate: 4. Moreover, owing to man’s inner constitution, activities which either are a natural expression of his creativity or are essential to his survival (building fi res and applying them to substances, grinding up hard substances into powder, etc.), involve refi ning the raw materials of nature into something…well, fi ner. So far, our chain of thoughts (a.-d.) points to a specifi c anthropological formula: Man is he who refi nes the natural world into greater and greater soulfulness. 5. What’s more, man’s dynamic “soul” relationship with the natural world reveals not only that there are levels of soul, but that this sliding scale of soul is the defi ning (even the only) category of existence. In other words, the category of “person” (which answers the question “who is it?”) is subordinated to the category", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

In other words, the category of “person” (which answers the question “who is it?”) is subordinated to the category of “soul,” the latter category answering the question “how much immutability does it contain?” $\\underline { { 5 0 } }$ 7. Since soul can be conceived as the inner essence or energy of a person or inanimate object, but without “person” being identifi ed with soul, we arrive quite naturally at a defi nition of soul as the energy that drives the natural processes of a hypostatic or anhypostatic “container.” In short, through a simple process one can add soul to personal or impersonal natures. Thus, there are levels of personhood/soulhood. Early man’s animistic mentality, as formulated by Mahdihassan, is the foundation of what could be called “cosmic analogy thinking,” which we may sum up as follows: The defi ning feature of the cosmic analogy is its notion of correspondent development or movement: There is a dynamic glue which holds world, man, and God together through its common motion. A real correspondence or analogy exists between the strata in that all three levels unfold according to the same pattern, along the same shape or frequency. Just so no mistake is made about it, let us baldly state that according to the cosmic analogy trinity there is not a single thing in the world or above it that stands outside of the grand mystico-temporal process that yokes God, man, and cosmos together in the common quest for cosmotheanthropic self-realization. Mahdihassan’s interpretation of alchemy as beginning with early man’s quest to refi ne the higher “soul of gold”52 frames the question in terms of “soul” as equivalent to “essence” or “origin of soul”: “To explain gold in terms of its soul, or of its origin, is the same as to establish the source of eternal existence or of creative energy to which immortality is actually due.”53 In this sense, the method of early alchemy is identical to the method of Scholastic theology, which, mutatis mutandis, identifi es the source of the Persons of the Trinity as Their common energy. Of course, the supposedly great insight of this Scholastic Trinity is that 1) the Holy Spirit is the energetic bond of love between the Persons, and that 2) this Holy Spirit/bond of love, viewed from a higher level of analysis, is the divine essence or source of God’s existence.54 The colossal confusions which the “cosmic analogy” introduces are best illustrated by Mahdihassan’s description of what the alchemist must have believed was his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Just as the Scholastic theologian’s eureka moment, his satisfying aesthetic solution to the problem of divine personal existence, was achieved through the individual theologian’s own raised consciousness (his realization that the solution to the riddle of the Spirit Who is Person or of the Ghost Who is Holy is that the Person was the divine energy, and that the divine energy was the essence), so the early alchemist realized that to solve the problem of divine Personal (hypostatic) existence is to defi ne the divine Person (God) as the “source of eternal existence or of Creative Energy.”56 Mahdihassan’s critique of the standard historiography of alchemy can be divided into several distinct strands. First, Mahdihassan, who assumes that alchemical transmutation has never been successful, asserts the following: “If we now accept alchemy to have been the art of synthesizing gold from alloys of base metals, this being impossible, there could never have been any alchemy. Then its history can only be the history of mere claims of synthesizing gold which would be nonsense.”57 This argument gains weight if we add to it Mahdihassan’s unique conclusion about the origin of alchemical terminology. For Mahdihassan, the position of Hopkins and others that the term “alchemy” means “art of Egypt” is highly unlikely, for “such a designation would be far too vague for a specialized art like alchemy.”58 The key lies in the Greek term for alchemy and its origin: The Greek term chemeia means both “elixir of gold,” and “art of making gold.”59 Thus, the Greek language did have a word for the elixir or philosopher’s stone, but since the historiography assumes a cleavage or even opposition between making gold and a supposedly separate mystical cult of immortality, it has been", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

In fact, if we backtrack to early Chinese sources, we fi nd a welldeveloped cult of longevity and immortality whose devotees saw in the creating of colloidal cinnabar-gold the apex of their art. The Chinese cared much more about creating this synthetic red gold, which is a combination of plant and mineral components that were (and still are) believed to have a soul content so rich that it can grant its user immutability and unlimited power over the cosmos.60 This is the second node of Mahdihassan’s critique of the standard approach to alchemy: It is untenable to follow the mainstream literature in its assumption that alchemy—a specialized science with a specifi c mystical symbolism—suddenly popped up in Alexandria with no historical precursors to herald its appearance and to explain from whence came its mythology.61 Mahdihassan offers an alternative scenario, which, greatly simplifi ed, goes something like this: 1. At the dawn of civilization, when men by and large fed themselves by hunting, elderly warriors who could not keep up with the chase endangered the survival of the entire society. 2. The most humane practice that was developed in response to this disquieting phenomenon was to permanently exile the elderly men into the forest (though in non-wooded areas, ritual execution of the unserviceable hunters seems to have been prevalent).62 These exiles had to support themselves without hunting, and so began to eat any root or berry that did not kill them.63 3. They soon discovered psychotropic drugs that inspired them to compose poems such those in the Rig Veda, which may be the oldest writing in existence.64 4. Mahdihassan identifi es Soma with the amphetamine Ephedra sinica, and believes that Soma and other like substances were at the heart of the longevity cults ubiquitous in the ancient world. These cults started with “simples,” like Soma, which were revered as drugs of rejuvenation and even of immortality. The Chinese believed that these simples, when combined in specifi c ways with plants and metals, resulted in a synthetic superdrug of longevity which was “the fi rst synthetic drug known to history and it was red colloidal gold.”65 This idea of an unbroken line of alchemical succession—from China, through Indian and Arab mediators, ending up in early medieval Europe by way of Alexandria—is the third and fi nal strand of Mahdihassan’s theory of alchemy that we", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

The unbroken succession theory is signifi cant because it offers the only viable explanation in the literature for the continued existence of a “power” element, associated equally with longevity/immortality and ascetico-mysticism, from ancient China until the present day. Mahdihassan and others supply us with ample evidence that alchemy, in each of its cultural phases, was never mere gold-making. In China, it was the Golden-Man, he who held the secret of the Great Work, “who could say ‘my life is within my own control and not heaven’s,’ as pronounced by Ko-Hung, the Chinese alchemist…”.67 Also fi nding its beginning in China was “potable gold,” which is still used there by some as a drug of rejuvenation.68 Apropos the Arab cultural phase, Mahdihassan notes that the surname “al-Sufi” originated with Jabir ibn Hayyan, “Sufi” referring to an ascetic Way parallel to the Chinese Dao. To suggest that Jabir’s life’s work was some materialistic lust for gold is thus quite untenable, especially since he often speaks of the elixir as a medicine par excellence.69 As for Greek alchemy, the earliest record of the art as practiced in Alexandria, the Dialogue of Cleopatra, “speaks of Medicine-of-Life, and of resurrecting the dead. Taylor continues to quote the text stating that the alchemists were asked by Cleopatra ‘to look at the nature of plants whence they come [and at the] divine Water (which) gives them a body in a being. (—) Here is clearly a Medicine-of-Life and its function is to resurrect the dead”.70 If more evidence is needed that Greek alchemy was equal parts gold-making and mysticism, insists Mahdihassan, we need only turn to the Corpus Hermetica —which drips spiritualism on every page—and to the Alexandrian Zossimus of Panopolis (fl . 300 A.D.), whose Gnostic brand of metallurgy “established an enduring connection between practical laboratory work and spiritual perfection.”71 Moving now to the last phase—the transmission of Arab and Greek alchemy to Europe—we fi nd ample evidence that the mystical theory of alchemy continued and thrived. In fact, if we follow Principe and Newman’s notion that iatrochemical alchemy appeared only with Paracelsus (1493-1541), we can make no historical sense of the thirteenth century debate in Europe over the legitimacy of alchemy.

Writers involved in the fracas such as Roger Bacon (c. 1220-1292) spent their lives repeating over and over that alchemical gold was the medicine of medicines, the cureall drug. As we touched on earlier, Bacon carried on the tradition of potable gold that fl ourished in the later Middle Ages and that persists, according to some sources, even to this very day.72 So, Bacon’s thirteenth century iatrochemistry disproves Principie and Newman’s wild assertion that iatrochemeia appeared in Europe over three hundred years later. Not only that, but—to repeat—the crux of the thirteenth century controversy over alchemy was its inherent teaching that the alchemist gains a power that equals or exceeds that of God Himself. Whether historians of science like it or not, many of the alchemical texts translated from Arabic into Latin discussed these mystical themes at great length, the power-motive never straying far from the surface.73 Keeping the insights of Farrell and Mahdihassan in mind, let us dive into the elusive but powerful world of alchemical imagery or iconography. First, we turn our attention to the 6th century B.C., when a seldom remembered upheaval occurred—we will term it “the Ionian revolution”—which rocked the Mediterranean world, the Asian continent, and possibly other parts of Europe as well.76 H.E. Stapleton affords a glimpse into the agitated scene: It was a century marked by a sudden outburst of revolutionary thought along the great highway of the Steppes over which—for, probably, thousands of years—the tide of humanity has ebbed and fl owed. (-) In China, the leader and guider of man’s thought was Confucius: in India, Gautama, the Buddha: in Iran, Zoroaster: in Greece, Pythagoras: and, however different the gospel was that each of these men preached, their teaching may be summed up in the Pauline phrase that henceforward men should “walk not after the fl esh but after the Spirit.”77 Stapleton goes on to pinpoint exactly what the connection between all of these thinkers was: A matter/spirit dualism which viewed ultimate truth as correct belief (ortho-doxy) about the “third thing”—the latter being the formula that gives one knowledge of the true plane of interaction between the spiritual and material realms, the knower of which is able to ascend to the uncreated realm, thereby attaining all of its attributes or powers.78 Pythagoras is known to have been a primary inspirer of Plato, and through the great Athenian sage, Pythagoras became also a forefather to the hermetists, to the Neoplatonists, and especially to the Renaissance poets and theologians who traced", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

A kind of mystical geometry was Pythagoras’ “third thing,” his divine/earthly tangent, and it began with a conception of God as an utterly transcendent, radically simple unity, or Monas. For Pythagoras and his followers, the Monas, or “Divine Unity” could not be represented or circumscribed in any way. Despite this staunch belief in the Monas’ utter transcendence—and this is one of the most earth-shaking, infl uential ideas ever conceived—Pythagoras allowed that the Monas could be indicated, however provisionally, by the simplest marking conceivable—a point.79 Though it was believed that the Monas was a dimensionless, uncontainable, transcendent Unity which could not be positioned, the attempt to represent this notion of God as a dot on a page (or other surface) undercut this purpose in an exceedingly subtle manner.80 Here are just a few of the (perhaps unintended) implications of the Monas as inscribed dot: 1. The non-positioned One has now been positioned, and can be circumscribed or otherwise limited through its relation to other inscribed points or fi gures. 2. Though it is not perfectly circular, a small blot on a page (or a small pebble in the sand) appears to be a tiny circle to the naked eye, as Robert Hooke noted (see fi g. 3),81 and we all know that a circle, however small, is divisible (and expandable). 3. As any geometer knows, a circle is created fi rst by fastening a compass arm upon a point, and then by tracing a fl owing point with the other compass arm, the resultant line being at all places equidistant from the initial point. Thus, the circle is by defi nition composite, being comprised of a center and a periphery. To translate this into cosmo-theological terms, God has a center and a periphery, and is thus composed of parts. S.K. Heninger speaks The fi rst step is recognition of a paradox: although unlimited and eternal, the monad, being a unit, is represented in the terms of Pythagorean number by a point, which of course has no dimension—indeed, has no existence except as a concept. (-) But when a number is imposed upon space and fi xed in position, it acquires extension; when number is impressed upon matter, it acquires physicality. Therefore, since the point as concept is correlative with the number 1, it assumes substance when it becomes 1 something—for example, 1 dot in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Therefore, since the point as concept is correlative with the number 1, it assumes substance when it becomes 1 something—for example, 1 dot in a diagram, or 1 stone, or 1 tree, or 1 man. In this fashion, the monad, infi nite and eternal though it may be, is placed in relationship to each item in nature.82 Now that God has exhaled, expanding Himself into a circle which surrounds Him, He wishes now to move his center, his point, to the periphery, thereby creating another circle, a second exhalation to mirror the fi rst. The resultant picture (fi g. 4) of two identical interlocking circles with a horizontal, mandorla shaped tangent-vector between them, represents the Pythagorean trinity. The Monas-point contains this trinitarian development within It, for 1) the circle presupposes a point, 2) the circle is itself a fl owing point, and thus 3) any part of the periphery can become a new circle, which nonetheless remains connected in a symmetrical unity with the initial point-circle. God’s exhalation or expansion into geometric extension is a necessary expression of God’s essence; it is the expression of God’s energy or activity, for otherwise God would remain sterile and unproductive of qualities and attributes, as Jung intimates: “Three is an unfolding of the One to a condition where it can be known—unity becomes recognizable; had it not been resolved into the polarity of the One and the Other, it would have remained fi xed in a condition devoid of every quality. Three therefore appears as a suitable synonym for a process of development in time, and thus forms a parallel to the self-revelation of the Deity as the absolute One unfolded into Three.”83 What is interesting here is that the third term, the copula or connecting factor in the Pythagorean trinity, is the concept of unity as a radical simplicity which is present in the point from the beginning as its unconscious telos, and which unity underlies the second, incarnational-cosmological step (the fi rst circle, or the Logos-Son) as its real meaning and potential. This notion of the third term as the radically simple inner meaning or reality of the second (and by extension, the fi rst) term, if we recall Jung’s comment above, is also equivalent to the activation of Divine energy or power, which is shown to be the undivided, uncreated substance from which sprang all of physical reality.

To follow the logic to its unavoidable conclusion: The prime matter, the undifferentiated substrate of Divine power cannot be distinguished from the essence of God, for both are radically simple, uncreated, and, most importantly, possess/express every attribute of the Divine: immortality, omnipotence, immutability, etc. The foregoing is a fi rst step toward substantiating our contention that the Platonic/Pythagorean trinity is an expression par excellence of alchemicoesoteric traditions which can be traced back to the early dualism of Indo-European and Asiatic societies; and, further, that this tradition was nurtured in the Middle Ages through the Neoplatonic fi lioquist triadology of the Christian West. The artisans and their aristocratic patrons who remained, century after century, avid practitioners of alchemy did so because their theological and philosophical purview pointed them toward what was, for them, the highest goal of all, the Great Work of transmutation, which gave man power over the cosmos. If we trace alchemy back to its early history in China, we fi nd much evidence that the elixir was seen as a universal soulforce that can become incarnate in an mineral or animal body: “[T]he cosmic soul is a universal life element; (-) it can also put life in a tottering dynasty which can retain power and continue to rule longer. (-) Accordingly ‘any manifestation of a change in nature meant that something was about to happen in the human world and (conversely) proper behaviour on the part of Man would also infl uence the way of Heaven.”84 Our thesis, if nothing else, fi nally offers a plausible explanation for the otherwise inexplicable lack of confl ict between the Latin Christian Church and the alchemists in the Middle Ages. Though she fails to draw any far-reaching conclusions, Ursula Szulakowska notes that “in fi fteenth century Canterbury…the monks had access to the largest collection of [alchemical] texts in Europe.”85 Vladimir Karpenko’s befuddlement at this Latin Christian-alchemical rapprochement is typical of much mainstream literature: “Surprisingly at the moment [of the] introduction of alchemy these two ideologies did not collide, and did not do [so] even later, in spite of the fact that the claims of alchemy to be able to achieve in the laboratory the same [results that are produced in] nature…was in obvious contradiction to the teaching of the Church. Because, in other words, alchemists pretended [to do] something [that] was an activity reserved exclusively to God himself.”86 Of the many primary sources that show an obvious melding of Western Christianity with alchemiohermeticism, The Book of the Holy Trinity (Das Buch der heiligen Dreifaltigkeit)87 seems most remarkable,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Sheppard, who defi ned alchemy as “the art of liberating parts of the Cosmos from temporal existence and achieving perfection which, for metals is gold, and for man, longevity, then immortality, and, fi nally, redemption.”89 Our proposed mixture of 1) Christianity, with its notion of a selfl ess love for the world, and 2) alchemical esotericism, with its ambiguous goal of power as a reward for the worthy, also explains the historiographical confusion over the motivations of alchemists, best expressed by Michela Pereira, who wrote: “Hermes’ teachings…led alchemists…to the discovery of the innermost arcana naturae, whose possession was eagerly desired at least from late Antiquity onward in order to improve humanity’s (or simply one’s own) life.”90 One wonders whether or not Pereira saw the irony in positing that alchemists were trying to help either 1) everyone else or 2) only themselves, as if these two motivations are tantamount; or whether she subscribes to some eudaemonistic ethic that sees no contradiction between selfi shness and selfl essness. Michael Maier’s Atalanta fugiens (Oppenheim, 1618) gives us a pictorial demonstration of the alchemical process of producing the lapis philosophorum in his famous illustration of a sage “squaring the circle” $( { \\underline { { \\mathrm { { f } } } } } \\mathrm { { g } } .$ 5). The sage, beginning with the point, produces a small circle. The duality of point and periphery, for Maier’s sage, is best expressed by the malefemale dichotomy, which we previously discussed in the introduction to this essay and in our section on Mahdihassan. Next the dual circle is expanded into a square, since “from every simple body the four elements must be separated.”91 Fittingly, the third stage of the Great Work reveals the ultimate meaning of the alchemical trinity: “By the transformation of the square into a triangle they teach that one should bring forth spirit, body and soul, which then appear in three brief colours before the redness.”92", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

The universal scope of the alchemist’s resultant power is shown in the fourth and fi nal step, the larger circle which touches the two lower corners of the triangle. This trinity-encompassing circle is “an immutable redness,” a power over the cosmos, a power that can transmute all things into its own radically simple essence.93 This doctrine of the alchemical production of prime matter as the “squaring of the circle” is more than a search for shiny metals, as Eric LaVigne stresses: “If the alchemist knew the formula that would square the circle…then he or she would have the key to the creation of the material world from the spiritual world, of the fi nite from the infi nite. The process could then also be made to go the other way, from the material world to the spiritual world and back again.”94 Another alchemical work, the anonymous Aurora consurgens (early 16th century), links the squaring of the circle witnessed in Maier’s illustration to the Carolingian “Shield of Faith” (fi g. 6).95 Notice that the Divine Persons are color-coded, the white Dove symbolizing the “whitening” process which follows the Son’s initial “blackening” process. The “immutable redness” alluded to in Maier’s illustration is here associated with the central circle of the Shield, the one which normally is labeled “God,” and which symbolizes the simple, uncompounded essence of God. As is known from alchemical texts, this fi nal step of “reddening” is the goal of the Great Work, and the research of Syed Mahdihassan, as treated above, has shown the age-old connection in the mind of man between intense redness and Soul-energy, the latter associated, naturally, with prime matter and its divine power.96 3.

On the “shield of faith,” or Scutum fi dei, see Michael Evans, “An Illustrated Fragment of Peraldus’s Summa of Vice: Harleian MS 3244,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 45 (1982): 14- 68. Signifi cantly, Evans sees the Scutum fi dei as the visual expression of the Athanasian Creed, which originated around 500 A.D. in Spain, and which is the fi rst historically verifi ed appearance of the fi lioque doctrine (!). Moreover, Evans astutely points out that the Scutum fi dei was a result of the Mediaeval West’s fascination with visual/geometrical fi gures representing logical principles. In this case, the shield represents the “square of opposition.” There could be no clearer evidence of the Mediaeval West’s Augustino-Platonic theological method of a dialectic of oppositions than this fi gure of the Holy Trinity as a divine system of logical oppositions: This, like most graphic epitomes, owes more to visual than verbal exegesis. Its source is the diagrammatic logical fi gure of the square of opposition. The adaptation of scientifi c diagrams and demonstrations to religious ends was attractive to medieval designers, and the dialectical visual aid in a triangular redaction economically set out the tenets of the Athanasian Creed. The simple addition of a horizontal bar to the limb connecting the terms ‘deus’ and ‘fi lius’ endowed the fi gure with allusions to the Incarnation and Redemption without diminishing its effectiveness as a demonstration of trinitarian doctrine. (-) The transformation of this simple yet cerebral fi gure into a shield accords with a tendency for abstract schemata to be realized as objective designs… (Evans, “Peraldus’s Summa,” 24). 7. Though the Carolingians’ engineering of the fi lioque interpolation into the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed is well attested, the reader should nonetheless consult the many works of Fr. John S. Romanides, whose researches have shown that is was Blessed Augustine of Hippo’s triadological formulation that inspired the Carolingians to base their entire theological edifi ce on the fi lioque, a fact that proved to be decisive for the Christian West. A good place to start is John S. Romanides, “The Christological Teaching of John of Damascus,” Ekklesiastikos Pharos 58 (1976): 232-269; and idem, An Outline of Orthodox Patristic Dogmatics, trans.

Dragas (Rollinsford, NH: Orthodox Research Institute, 2004). 8. Both the fi lioquist and the alchemical conceptions of God as “monas” resemble the Pythagorean Guillaume Saluste du Bartas’ “paradox of the monad,” which describes the One as “no Nomber, but more then a Nomber yet; / Potentially in all, and all in it” (His Devine Weekes and Workes, trans.

Emphasis added. 10. Considerations of space prohibit an analysis of the Neo-Orthodox movement in Protestant theology, which ostensibly rejected analogia entis, but only by a more trenchant affi rmation analogia fi dae, the belief that the words of Holy Scripture are the sole authority for the Church. See the works by John S. Romanides listed in the bibliography for an analysis and refutation of analogia fi dae. Fr. John carefully connects analogia entis and analogia fi dae to Augustine, and traces the latter’s teachings back to their Hellenistic roots. 16. The Orthodox teaching about man being created “in” or “according to” the image of God contrasts with the Western Christian view which followed Blessed Augustine’s formulation that man is the image of God, a created refl ection of God’s essence. For a sophisticated discussion of Orthodox and Augustinian “imago Dei” theology see M. Aghiorgoussis (now Met. Maximos of Pittsburgh), “Applications of the Theme ‘EIKON THEOU’ (Image of God) according to Saint Basil the Great,” Greek Orthodox Theological Review 21.3 (Fall 1976): 265-288. 17. “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:18). Even though the Orthodox spiritual life is concerned preeminently with experience of God, and even though the Orthodox do not mistake words such as prayers and sacred writings for communion with God in His glory, words are nonetheless central to spiritual life as images or symbols that call the worshipper to communion with God (Gr. symbollon: “bringing unlike things together”).

It must be stipulated, however, that though the Orthodox proclaim the realism, or reality of God’s glory in the heart of His holy ones, they never reify the uncreated, ineffable Light. The danger is that terms like “glory” and “energy,” the more they are handled and circumscribed in our reasoning and through our lips, begin to represent God’s love as a concept, as something already “known about.” 18. Daniel 3.25: “He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fi re, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God”; I Kings 8.27: “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?” 20. On “the call” in Gnosticism see Werner Foerster, Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts, 2 vols., trans. and ed. R. McL. Wilson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972): “The central factor in Gnosis, the ‘call,’ reaches man neither in rational thought nor in an experience which eliminates thought. Man has a special manner of reception in is ‘I.’ He feels himself ‘addressed’ and answers the call. He feels that he is encountered by something that already lies within him, although admittedly entombed. It is nothing new, but rather the old which only needs to be called to mind it is like a note sounded at a distance, which strikes an echoing chord in his heart” (1.2). 21. John S. Romanides, The Ancestral Sin, trans. with an introduction by George S. Gabriel (Ridgewood: Zephyr, 2002). See especially chapter one, entitled “Creation, the Fall, and Salvation in Greek Philosophy in General” (41-49), where Fr. John analyzes the happiness-centeredness of the Hellenistic mind: “The immutable and inactive One of Greek philosophy is rather a projection of the human thirst for a secure understanding of the meaning of existence itself and for eudaemonia. It is the object of man’s intellectual desire for an entirely natural certainty of salvation but without a real revelation and the gradual saving energy of God in the world. It is also a self-centered principle imaginatively constructed according to the desires of man” (47). 22.

R. van den Broek and Wouter J. Hanegraaff (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1998), 1-20, esp. 9-11. 26. Joseph P. Farrell, in an unpublished typescript in the author’s possession entitled “Partial Listing of Christologies of Classical Heresies and Gnostics,” notes that docetists “begi[n] with the assertion that matter is crude and evil; and so conclud[e] that Christ was pure spirit; the physical appearance was an optical illusion and mere semblance (dokesis); Christ was merely God masquerading as man” (4; unnumbered pages). 27. Section two will make apparent why, from a certain point of view, alchemico-hermetic texts seem to praise matter. To anticipate my later argument, matter is “honored” by alchemists because it is believed to have been divided, developed, and “scissioned” from the “aither,” the materia prima, which is uncreated and which contains every divine attribute. See the Introduction for background on the slightly different context and meaning of “aither” as it was used in Greco-Egyptian alchemy. Titus Burckhardt gives us a sense of the ambiguous, because literally otherworldly, attitude toward matter found in alchemy specifi cally and Hermeticism generally: “In this view, matter remains an aspect or function of God. It is not something separated from spirit, but its necessary complement. In itself it is no more than the potentiality of taking on form, and all perceptible objects in it bear the stamp of its active counterpart, the Spirit or Word of God. “It is only for modern man that matter has become a thing and no longerthe completely passive mirror of the Spirit” (Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul, tr. William Stoddart [Louisville, KY: Fons Vitae, 1997], 58-59, emphasis added). Here “ousia” or nature is spirit; matter is reduced to a different ontological category, namely, “function/will/energeia,” which lacks a sentient, thelemic existence since everything it does is done by someone above who has a nature, that is, who exists and subsists. This ambiguity toward matter seen as the husk containing divine light is refl ected in the later American version of hermeticism—American “nature religion”—which denies the reality of the concrete world in order to serve “the world” (Albanese, Republic of Mind, 25). 32.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

To see alchemy as nothing more than mercenary magic is just as reductive as Silberer and Jung’s unsatisfactory psychological interpretation. See Herbert Silberer, Hidden Symbolism of Alchemy and the Occult Arts, trans. Smith Ely Jelliffe (New York: Dover, 1971 [1917]). On the origin of alchemy as iatrochemical therapy which centers upon gold (or earlier, a herbal panacea called soma) as a prime substance imbued with incorruption, see the dozens of remarkable works by S. Mahdihassan listed in Hakim Mohammed Said, ed, Essays On Science: Felicitation Volume in Honour of Dr. S. Mahdihassan (Karachi, Pakistan: Hamdard Foundation Press, 1987), 280-309. Also see H.H.

For criticisms of Jung’s view of alchemy see S. 33. Farrell, Philosopher’s Stone, 36. The “Schwaller” cited is R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz, the noted authority on Egyptian religion and civilization. In his bibliography Farrell includes Schwaller’s Sacred Science: The King of Pharaonic Theocracy (Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions International, 1988). For a full exposition of Schwaller’s interpretation of the Egyptian worldview see Joseph P. Farrell, The Giza Death Star Destroyed, 99-129. 35. Ibid. The alchemist George Ripley (1415-1490), in the prologue to his “The Compound of Alchemy,” describes the process of transmutation in terms which match Farrell’s emphases on 1) reverse engineering of matter and 2) process triadology: “O Unity in the substance, and Trinity in the Godhead…. As thou didst make all things out of one chaos, so let me be skilled to evolve our microcosm out of one substance in its three aspects of Magnesia, Sulphur, and Mercury” (A.E. Waite, ed., The Hermetic Museum, 2 vols. [London: J. Elliot and Co., 1893], 2.139. Cited in George B. Kauffman, “The Role of Gold in Alchemy. Part II,” Gold Bulletin 18.2 [1985]: 69-78, at 71). F. Pregadio claims that alchemy was viewed as reverse engineering in early Chinese alchemy. As evidence he reminds us that an early Chinese term for the philosopher’s stone was huandan, which means “Reverted Elixir.” “…[T]he central act of the alchemical process consists in causing matter to revert to its state of ‘essence’ (jing), or prima materia.” In this scheme, to be transmuted is to be “huan,” or “reverted” (Pregadio, 38). 37.

See above, footnote 33, on Jung’s view of alchemy. Our thesis that alchemy is a quest for unlimited power made possible by back-engineering matter does not depend upon the idea of alchemy as an incredibly long history of failure. Farrell is not satisfi ed with this unlikely prospect, nor is Eric John Holmyard, who recounts a possibly authentic case of transmutation by Johann Friedrich Helvetius (Johann Friedrich Schweitzer, 1625-1709): When his fi rst amazement was over, Helvetius experienced a recurrence of skepticism, and ran with the gold, while it was yet hot, to a neighbouring goldsmith, who tested it with the touchstone and declared it to be genuine. The next day all the Hague heard of the marvel, and the Examiner-General of the Dutch Mint, Porelius, asked Helvetius to submit the gold to the thorough examination customary at the Mint. he at once agreed to this suggestion, and the gold was thereupon tested, by both quartation and fusion with antimony, by Brectel, a silversmith. The result was a little unexpected, for it was found that the gold had increased in weight by two scruples during the operation; a phenomenon which Helvetius accounts for by assuming that the gold was still “active” and had transmuted into gold two scruples of the silver used in the quartation. The net result of the matter was, he says, that the elixir had converted six drams of lead and two scruples of silver into the purest gold. In passing judgment upon this story, it is important to observe (a) that Helvetius was a man of indubitable integrity; (b) that he admits to having been skeptical even up to the last moment; (c) that the account he gives us is almost contemporary, having been published at Amsterdam in 1667; (d) that he prepared the crucible and lead himself; (e) that he and his wife were the only people present at the experiment; (f) that there is confi rmatory evidence of the gold having been tested by Brectel.

Woodward (“The Alchemy of Alchemy,” The William and Mary Quarterly 60.4 (2003): 920-924), who decries William Newman’s “relegat[ing]…the divine to a somewhat unanalyzed supporting role” in his examination of the career of George Starkey (924). Cf. William Newman, Gehennical Fire: The Lives of George Starkey, an American Alchemist in the Scientifi c Revolution (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2002). Another prominent scholar who shares this author’s disapproval of the one-sidedness of Newman and his ilk is Michela Pereira of the University of Siena, who in her review of Newman’s Promethean Ambitions: Alchemy and the Quest to Perfect Nature (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2004), which appeared in Renaissance Quarterly 58.2 (Summer 2005): 678-680, cannot believe the blindness to the hermetic roots of alchemy exhibited by Newman and also by alchemy scholar Pierre Hadot: “Neither author seems to remember that the alchemists themselves used to place…Hermes Trismegistos…at the origin of their art” (680). Cf. P. Hadot, Le voile d’Isis. Essai sur l’histoire de l’idée de Nature (Paris: Gallimard, 2004). Principe and Newman are not alone in their reductionism, nor is Pereira alone in her rejection of it. Consider, for instance, Ole Peter Grell’s double review of Pamela Smith’s The Business of Alchemy: Science and Culture in the Holy Roman Empire (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994) and Raphael Patai’s The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Sourcebook (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), which appeared in The British Journal for the History of Science 29.1 (March 1996): 93- 94. Grell registers his surprise that Pamela Smith has reduced alchemist J.J. Becher, whose mystical preoccupations led him to hatch Neoplatonic utopian schemes, to an artisan who shed his Paracelsism Principe-style somewhere around 1650 or so. R.J.W. Evans, in his lukewarm review of Smith’s book (English Historical Review 111.444 [Nov. 1996]: 1286-1287), also expresses his doubts that Becher “abandoned the system of occult beliefs held by his patrons” to become a proto-capitalist (1287). 44. It is, in fact, quite surprising, considering the “hermeneutics of suspicion”-style revisionism which has held sway in the academic world especially since the twentieth century, that no one has, with a steady hand, followed the alchemical thread back to its power-motivation and its association with particular privileged groups.

Leah DeVun, Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the Late Middle Ages (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), 105: “…[O]ne need not draw a sharp contrast between materialism and spirituality in alchemy. Rupescissa’s alchemy was above all material and operative, but it was nevertheless aimed at the solution of spiritual problems: Antichrist, the apocalypse, and the collective salvation of the Christian community. Moreover, Rupescissa built the theory of his alchemy upon spiritual concepts.” Here and elsewhere in chapter six (p. 102-128), DeVun gives ample evidence that, at least in the case of John of Rupescissa, the alchemical code words he used (like “Venus” for iron, etc.) had a religious signifi cance, a fact that William Newman seems to deny. 48. “Thus one and the same agent could confer immortality on man as also make gold. Here ended Animism with the exploitation of soul as such or of an already stored quantum of it. Here also ended Herbalism or the exploitation of herbs as the vehicle of cosmic soul. This was because herbs yielding Kimiya or Soma were scarce or not found at all. The alchemist now proposed to generate the cosmic soul. Animism merely extends the constitution of man to substances thereby endowing each of them with a soul” (Mahdihassan, “Dualistic Symbolism,” 57-58). 49. Mercea Eliade, in “The Forge and the Crucible: A Postscript,” History of Religions 8.1 (1968): 74- 88, agrees with Mahdihassan that the fi rst alchemists “were ‘experimenters,’ not abstract thinkers or erudite scholastics. Their inclination to ‘experiment,’ however, was not limited to the natural realm. … [T]he experiments with mineral or vegetal substances pursued a more ambitious goal: to change the alchemist’s own mode of being” (77). 54. Note the following passage from Mahdihassan’s Indian Alchemy or Rasayana in the Light of Asceticism and Geriatrics (New Delhi: Vikas, 1979): “Indian philosophy [and] theoretical alchemy… are founded on Dualism merging into Monism” (ix). Here Madhihassan’s insight that a “1” is hiding behind the dyadic “2” is paralleled by Farrell and others’ discovery that Western triadology’s distinctive note is its “bond of love,” which is a movement from 1) initial monism (the radically simple “Deus” or essence), to 2) dualism (Father/Son versus Holy Spirit), and back to monism (the Holy Spirit as the dualistic bond turns out to be the radically simple essence of step one). 56.

Ibid. Joseph P. Farrell, in chapter nine of his Giza Death Star Destroyed (pp. 196-221), offers an analysis of the “eureka moment” of esotericism and Augustinism as it appears in modern (and ancient) physics. See also the appendix to chapter nine (pp. 222-245) for an exposition, in mathematical terms, of esoteric cosmo-theanthropology. 60. “There is gold to strengthen the body and growth-soul of a perennial plant to make human life correspondingly perennial, whence red-gold became the dual purpose drug of longevity. (-) …[W]hile later on alchemy always tried to make gold and never succeeded, it can be properly redefi ned as the art that successfully make red-gold or red colloidal gold” (Mahdihassan, “Cinnabar-gold,” 97). 61. In the Introduction, we do not follow Mahdihassan’s position on the non-Alexandrian origin of alchemy, since documentation in the form of accurately dated texts is lacking. However, we do not rule out Mahdihassan’s contention, especially since—to judge by some extant sources—China may have had an extremely ancient tradition of alchemy. 62. Amazingly, Mahdihassan notes that this “inclemency” of early man to the elderly was often extended to women and children. Moreover, the practice of forced exile in hunter-gatherer society appears to have been universal, even extending to German forests where fathers unfi t to hunt were beheaded by sons in ceremonies that, as a consolation prize, promised the aged and infi rm a ticket to Valhalla (Indian Alchemy, 6-8). 64.

Note also that the notion of the elixir as an agent giving one the wherewithal to “fl y about,” in effect transcending the limits of space, which we noticed in the Rig Veda (O’Flaherty, 137: “I am huge, huge! fl ying to the cloud.”), later becomes the Taoist “Kimia [which] made its user not only immortal but also capable of fl ying about; man became a jinn, which again is a Chinese word otherwise pronounced as Hsien” (Mahdihassan, “Alchemy, in Its Proper Setting,” 2). Here we see the journey of the Vedic Soma to the Chinese “pill of immortality” and fi nally to the D’jini of the Arabian Nights. Though he is wrong in his notion that the Alexandrians cared nothing for the mystical elements of alchemy, scholar Tenney L. Davis says the Chinese “were attempting to make real gold artifi cially, not because of its intrinsic value but because of its magical effi cacy. They wished to compound from it edible pills of immortality by the eating of which they would be converted into Hsien or benevolent immortals” (Davis, “Origins of Alchemy,” 557). 72.

Let it be noted that our argument against the “lust for gold” interpretation does not entail a denial that some individuals—with a power motivation—wanted to make mass quantities of gold. Ogrinc cites at least one King of England whose alchemical interests pointed in this area. This royal example is paralleled by that of the “puffers,” who were hack alchemists who did not seem to be in touch with the deeper signifi cance of the Great Work. However, none of this can stand as evidence against our thesis or for the “goldlust” thesis, for 1) the fact that “puffers” were derided as uncomprehending misers proves that many believed in alchemy’s mystical side, and 2) the source material does not provide anything like an objective view of these “puffers.” Were they really so obtuse? The authors of these anti-puffer sources were also known for their jealousy of and hostility toward other alchemists with whom they were in competition for patronage and prestige. 76. We have taken the phrase “Ionian revolution” from A.R. Utke, who uses the term in a very narrow sense. For Utke, the Ionian upheaval is the scientifi c, rational turn signaled by the Pre-Socratics. In this essay the revolution is considered in its broader aspect, as a worldwide spiritual and cultural shift. For Utke’s defi nition see his “Alchemy and the Concept of Ultimate Reality and Meaning,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 27.1 (2004): 51-69, at 54; and also his “The Cosmic Holism Concept: An Interdisciplinary Tool In the Quest For Ultimate Reality and Meaning,” Interdisciplinary Studies In the Understanding of Ultimate Reality and Meaning 17.3 (1986): 134-155. 78.

It is quite possible that he saw no contradiction between the One’s utter transcendence and its immanent refl ection in creation. For example, if we fl ash forward several centuries Blessed Augustine, in De Trinitate, does not seem to be bothered by the idea of a real analogy of the essence of the Holy Trinity in nature. In fact, he is rather well pleased with his “trinity-spotting” project, though it is not clear if Augustine is elevating his trinitarian speculations to the realm of dogma. Relevant passages from De Trinitate have been collected and analyzed by Fr. John S. Romanides in his “Yahweh of Glory According to the 1st, 2nd, and 9th Ecumenical Councils,” Theologia 71 (2000): 133-199. 80. Mahdihassan makes the astute connection between the Pythagorean “point-circle” and the Brahman-Atman dichotomy in the Upanishads: “…[A]ll forms preceded from the formless.

Jung, Psychology, 119. The notion of a divine barrenness that is overcome through subsequent activation or differentiation is contained in the alchemical symbol of the Cosmic egg: “It contains the germ of all that exists, the creation and the creator. In an egg its contents are not developed” (“Alchemy and Its Chinese Origin As Revealed by Its Etymology, Doctrines and Symbols,” Iqbal Review 7 (1966): 22-58, at 34). Mahdihassan marvels at an illustration (“Positive Conception,” 112) depicting the cosmos as two fi sh swimming in a circular sea surrounding a central point, which the artist expanded so that it looked like the sun’s disc. For Madhihassan the ingenuity of the artist was his depiction of the divine point as unknowable (the disc is plain and unadorned) and yet also knowable (it is a disc and is monochromatic, as the sun is often represented). 85.

In this section we have traced the development of different notions of threeness in the history of Western esotericism and—briefl y—in the mystical theology of Eastern Orthodoxy. Our examination calls into question the conclusions of much mainstream writing on esotericism through fresh readings of primary sources and new looks at previously neglected secondary writings. Though many important points were developed along the way, our focus remained what we termed the cosmo-theanthropic trinity, which seems to have been universal in the ancient world (excepting some pockets of Judaic culture), and remains, we contend, the basis of Western esotericism, as the history of alchemy evinces. In the West, alchemy became intertwined with Christian theology in the centuries following the life of Blessed Augustine of Hippo Regius. So, why should anyone living in today’s world care about these matters? The signifi cance of our thesis becomes readily apparent when we consider the continuity of two traditions— alchemy and Augustinian theology—as they have existed from their origins to today. Indeed, up to the writing of this book, the Western world has produced no successor to the Augustinian esoteric paradigm, or at least no successor has been found that overturns the fundamental presuppositions of this worldview. The next two chapters will aim at fl eshing out this Augustinian esoteric paradigm, though I must beg the reader’s patience, the directions we hope to trace being accessible only through the most circuitous of indirect paths. 1.

Hopefully my pun on the Greek word for “will” does not create more confusion than amusement. “A civilization, like a human being, has a will to live, but it may also arrive at the neurotic condition of having a will to die.” Medievalist Norman F. Cantor spoke thusly of the late thirteenth century, that most exhilarating of epochs, which erected grand thought systems that seemed to generate at least as much tension as satisfaction.1 The rediscovery of Aristotle had inspired St. Thomas Aquinas and others to construct a more inclusive, more synthetic religio-philosophical edifi ce than had previously been thought possible. However, many became increasingly discontent with the new synthesis, most notably the Ockamists, who called into question the convoluted Thomistic scheme, with its proliferation of categories and relations. Has the incorporation of more and more concepts and terms into the earlier, simpler Scholasticism really drawn us any closer to the truth? Such thoughts doubtless plagued the late thirteenth century mind. More generally, the thirteenth century seemed to have introduced a new kind of tension into all areas of life. New practices were developing in art, religion, and politics; these innovations were often reactions against the perceived constrictiveness of the “new traditions.” Heresy, though it had never really abated, was then raging ever more strongly in the West. The Inquisition and the Albigensian Crusade head up the thirteenth century’s list of dubious accomplishments. From these facts we are tempted to generalize (thought it may seem too obvious to state) that societies undergoing a disconcerting amount of change often counter by creating new scapegoats, an activity which, at its most intense core, turns mystical. But, it is true that we would not know of the thirteenth century’s staunch inquisitionmindedness had there not been a plethora of antagonistic heretical groups with which the thirteenth century European establishment had to contend. Perhaps even more obnoxious to established society were those elements that burst on the scene from within groups that could not be easily sifted out and ostracized, and which thus may be termed novel orthodoxies. These “new traditions,” ironically, provoked new heresies, chief amongst them the reemergence of the concept of patriotism in the West. In the wake of Philip IV of France’s war against the rebellious Flemish, an anonymous preacher declared that the people should fi ght for King Philip not because of any mere feudal obligation, but rather because the King was the head of the kingdom, and all of his subjects were members of this body, which was “patria,” or “the fatherland.” Further, this zealous homilist proclaimed that the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

However, if we trace the political history of Europe backward in time from Philip the Fair’s reign into the origins of the Frankish kingdom, the earthshaking import of Philip’s reign for all subsequent history becomes apparent. Specifi cally, our backward glance shows that Philip’s reign was the endpoint of a long development, one facet of which was the centralization of power in the hands of the French crown and the concomitant transformation of the Frankish king into the single most powerful authority in the world.5 We must not forget that a few centuries before Philip came to power, the king of France was little more than a feudal lord who ruled only the narrow strip of land that was the Ile-de-France, though he was the nominal ruler over much more. Ironically, the ascendancy of the French crown to almost unheard of heights of power was paralleled by the transformation of the Pope from local For scholar Joseph P.

Farrell the long historical process which culminated with the power contest between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip the Fair can be traced to the theological formulations of Blessed Augustine of Hippo. While it may seem strange to suggest that the writings of a single man could carry enough weight to shape all subsequent theological discourse for an entire civilization, let it be noted that a great number of authorities, both pro and con, name Augustine as the most important Church Father for Western Christianity. Protestant theologian Paul Tillich takes for granted that Blessed Augustine “is the foundation of everything the West has to say,” and the Roman Catholic Augustino Trape proclaims that the bishop of Hippo Regius is “undoubtedly the greatest of the Fathers…”.7 Of the many innovations propagated by Augustine, possibly the most signifi cant for the history of sacerdotium et regnum in the West was his identifi cation of the divine essence of the Holy Trinity with the radically simple “One” of Plotinus.8 The unity of the Augustino-Platonic essence precedes the multiplicity of its Trinity of Persons, and this fact seems to disallow any true distinction between the divine attributes, the divine Persons, and the divine essence. Indeed, in the Augustino-Platonic scheme the divine essence came to have a status almost as a fourth Person of the Holy Trinity, as the Western Scutum Fidei, or “Shield of Faith,” with its fourth central circle, often labeled “Deus,” unwittingly indicates. By the time of Philip the Fair’s reign, both the Pope and the French king were locked in a fi erce power struggle, and Farrell gives us some insight into why this clash was well nigh inevitable for the Augustinian West: A type of legal monophysitism had taken hold in the West according to which a new abstract “legal” conception of the offi ce of Pope/king was set in opposition to the actual human being who held the offi ce.9 This bizarre formulation, the history of which is examined in Ernst Kantorowicz’s The King’s Two Bodies, is the end result of a long process of de-liturgization and de-concretization in Western political and religious culture. Ironically, Kantorowicz and Farrell point out, the Papacy was not immune to this de-liturgizing virus, but rather succumbed to it all too readily.10 The main points to be kept in mind are that: 3. The new de-liturgized State, based on the new anhypostatic Law, found its analogue in the newly emerging Papal claims, the latter relying henceforth less and less on adherence to the personal truth of “faith,” and turning more and more to “fi delity”—a new conception of the Pope as the ultimate liege lord, a coercive power having no conceivable limit.

In such an Augustinized, and thus Platonized, socio-religious milieu, the term “Catholic” ceased to mean “according to the Truth,” and came to mean “submission to the authority of the Pope.” Doubtless the preceding summary of the convoluted path, full of unlikely twists and breathtaking recapitulations, which led from the Platonizing innovations of Augustine to the earthshaking showdown between Philip the Fair and Boniface VIII, raises as many questions as it answers. For further reading, consult Kantorowicz’s previously mentioned The King’s Two Bodies and Joseph P. Farrell’s magnum opus: God, History and Dialectic. It is now necessary to turn our attention to Philip the Fair. The remainder of this section will attempt to trace the king’s inscrutable, contradictory, and often downright neurotic behavior to its root in the Western monophysitic theory of kingship. Our thesis is that Philip the Fair followed the theory of the king’s two bodies more self-consciously and more circumspectly than anyone, perhaps, who reigned before or after him. Bishop Saisset, a man whose name is found in history books mainly because his enmity against Philip the Fair led to a notable phase in the investiture contest, is said to have spoken these rancorous words of the king: Philip the Fair is “neither man nor beast, but only image.”12 Playing upon Philip’s epithet—“le Bel”—Saisset’s words only grow more caustic: King Philip is “the handsomest of birds which is worth absolutely nothing…such is our king of France who is the handsomest man in the world and who can do nothing except to stare at men.”13 Many contemporaries shared Saisset’s impression of the King’s extreme passivity, a quality that Philip knowingly and artfully combined with an equally exaggerated sense of his royal majesty.14 Philip’s appearance in public often inspired an almost apocalyptic terror in his subjects. At these well-staged events the king stood as a type of Stoic central point—or as the “unextended point” of hermeticism discussed elsewhere in this volume15—amidst his imposing entourage. Note this Englishman’s reaction to the king’s appearance at Vienne in 1311: “He comes with a host of people and [great] furor. We fear his raging and we tremble at his coming.”16 Doubtless Philip’s “raging” was precisely his undemonstrative yet ultra-imperial manner. As Joseph R. Strayer epitomized Philip’s royal persona, “he was the image on the great seal, enthroned alone in his royal glory.”17 Yet, there is more to this picture, or to this statue, if you prefer.

Many were not overawed by Philip the Fair’s iconic pretensions, as evinced by the stream of criticism of the king that fl owed more or less without refrain from the Pope’s pen until Philip succeeded in installing his own more accommodating Pope, Clement V, who just happened to have been a Frenchman. Somewhat closer to home, Geffroi de Paris published a poem which dovetailed two insults against Philip by implying that the king was so silent and statue-like in public because during his incessant excursions in the royal forests he regularly ended the hunt with “the least” of the prey.18 Indeed, Philip the Fair’s carefully orchestrated projection of himself as royal icon par excellence had its fl ip-side, for the king showed his ire whenever he sensed that his royal will was opposed or his majestic dignity oppugned. On one occasion, the king “ordered submerged in the river with a stone attached to his neck a certain man who said that all the wine in Paris could not fi ll [the king] up. The king declared, ‘I’ll at least fi ll you up with water,’ and the man drank on and on.”19 Let us keep this image of Philip as a cruel avenger of his own royal honor in mind as we turn back to the fi rst side of the coin— Philip’s career as a statue, a living icon of kingship. The main historiographical problem of Philip the Fair scholarship is the question as to whether Philip actually did anything effectual during his reign or instead let his dynamic team of über-lawyers control royal policy, and it seems quite obvious that this interpretive quandary is not unrelated to the issue of the king’s stoic persona. As Joseph Strayer commented, “it is hard to prove that any important act of the reign was the result of a personal decision by the king. It is easy to argue that he did nothing.”20 However, Strayer’s seminal The Reign of Philip the Fair paints quite a different picture of the king as regnally hyperactive, indeed almost frenetic in his scheming to expand royal prerogatives into new areas.21 At this point it is necessary to take a step back and make a stab at interpreting Philip the Fair’s sphinx-like persona.

One virtue of our thesis that Philip the Fair’s life was a case of arrested thelema is that it answers questions about the king that otherwise remain impenetrable. Take the following statement about Philip from Strayer: “There are almost no anecdotes about him…. (-) It is a great deal easier to think of Philip as a symbol of monarchy than to understand him as a man.”23 These chapters on King Philip propose that the issue that befuddled Strayer is a lot simpler than anyone has yet suspected: Philip the Fair of France wanted to be a true icon of the divine. From one angle, there is nothing noteworthy in Philip’s deifi c aspiration, since the theory of kingship in the West is based upon the notion that the king is christomimetes, the only true wielder of divine grace.24 However, viewed from another vantage point, that of the bizarre development in the West of the meaning of “icon” in the context of kingly ritual and dogma, Philip’s desire to be one with the divine royal archetype shows itself to be a rather gothic reductio ad absurdum. It now becomes necessary to retrace our steps back to the early Visigothic and Frankish roots of royal religion in order to better understand what factors led to such an odd late medieval climax: the troubling spectacle of a king, the most powerful man in the world, who thinks he is a statue. From the fi fth century to the eighth century, the decline of the Western half of the Roman Empire into a chaotic cultural backwater was accompanied by what has been described as the rise of Hellenistic monarchy in the Eastern part of the Empire, centered of course in Constantinople New Rome.25 It is essential to note that in Eastern Roman society (and until the Carolingian period, Western Roman society as well), the regnum was thought of in terms of a cooperative relationship with the sacerdotium, that is, the Church and Her Patriarch.

The development of the coronation ceremony, which became centered more and more on the ecclesial basis of kingly power though it retained the element of popular assent through acclamation, has been misinterpreted in Western scholarship as evidence either of “caesaropapism” or of an abiding “secular” element in the Eastern Roman conception of imperium.26 A quotation from scholar Janet L. Nelson elucidates the profound differences between the Eastern Roman and the later Western conceptions of the imperium: Of course, the clerical hierarchy existed as a specialist institution in eastern as in western christendom. But in Byzantium it produced no hierocratic theory, laid no claim to monopolise active participation in the church—which in a sociological sense was coterminous with the community of Christian believers. The divine will was believed to operate directly through all members of this community. Thus sixthcentury theorists focussed [sic] not on the coronation…but on election and consent as the crucial elements in imperial inauguration. And in election and consent, leading offi cials, senators and people…are all involved in the expression of the divine choice, and precisely their coincidence generates a ‘lawful succession’ (ennomos anarresis). In such an inclusive cosmology, the patriarch took his place without friction alongside other channels of divine communication.27 In this conception of the emperor as fulfi lling a divine ministry alongside the other ministries of “Church” and “people,” there is no system of “checks and balances” rife with coercive tension as in modern “democracies” nor is there any idea of an autocratic secular ruler who mediates literally between God and Law, as in the later developments of the medieval West.28 Instead, there is a symphonia between the emperor, the Church, and the people, a harmonization of purpose based upon the Orthodoxy of each individual within each tangential sphere. The purity of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy was the basis of all politics, art, and wisdom in the Eastern Roman Empire, because the purity of belief undergirt the proper fulfi lling of each charismatic ministry, from the lowliest farmer to the emperor himself. Some may try to refute this notion of an Eastern Roman Orthodox symphonia as a hopelessly idealistic notion that never actually existed in practice. However, just as the notion of a capitalist free market (or a pre-capitalist free market) is based largely upon negations—such as the absence of centralized planning, etc.—which are not absolute but rather indications of aspiration and purpose, so the Orthodox symphonia consists in apophatic principles which gesture toward the correlating ministries of emperor,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

This is why Westerners, who know only cataphasis in politics and faith, and who thus can point to neat, absolute structures of power, which they mistakenly equate with good order or “rational governance,” see nothing but confusion and disorder in an East Roman society that refuses to accept the many varieties of feudalistic oppression which have developed in the West, instead following the original politeia of Christian Hellenism. This Orthodox view of politics sees society as the coming together of the people of God in an ascetic, communal “work of the people” (leitourgeia) which accepts no fi nal authority save that based in communion with God. Needless to say, the divine-human communion of the Eastern Roman society is opposed to that of the supposedly divine princes of the West, who have become deifi ed through their anointing with uncreated Holy Oil and/or through the simple fact that they have blue Frankish blood in their veins.30 Rather, the Orthodox society places all hope in theosis, the union with the energies of the Holy Trinity achieved by prophets, apostles and saints, some of whom have been emperors, farmers, soldiers, and Patriarchs. In the cataphatic formulation of Western or Frankish Civilization, sacred kings and imperial bishops—each enthroned on one side of a dialectically opposed, divinely constituted binary of power—locked horns in the notorious Investiture Contest.31 To skip ahead for a moment, let us not forget that Philip the Fair’s kidnapping and mauling of Pope Boniface VIII through the offi ces of William of Nogaret is the last pathetic scene in the drama of Investiture.32 No equivalent to the sorry spectacle of Investiture ever did, nor ever could transpire in the Eastern Roman Empire, for there was no Frankish Civilization (feudalism) in the East, until rapacious Frankish crusaders brought it there in the thirteenth century, perpetrating unspeakable outrages against the Orthodox Romans they tried to enslave there.33 Needless to say, wherever and whenever the Franks were ousted, it was a simultaneous eradication of feudal institutions and feudal law.

Now we will follow this excursus into medieval history with a concluding section. Because of the enigmatic nature of Philip’s personality, which has caused all scholars until now to, in one way or another, throw up their hands in despair, we will try to draw everything together in a perhaps risky but undoubtedly courageous closing discourse. Do not be surprised to fi nd yourself asked to squint at grainy illustrations or to agree to seemingly inordinate leaps of thought. It is high time that the spirit of Frances Yates was conjured forth to confront the ghost of King Philip. Why? Because the issue of Philip the Fair’s dilemma of will, like the issue of the origin and nature of alchemy covered in Part 1, has refused to yield any satisfying answers when approached through the heretofore “accepted” means of scholarly analysis. It is time to gently push the envelope, hoping against hope that it does not tear in half. The preceding chapters of this, our study’s second part, have aimed to show that Philip the Fair’s case of arrested thelema, far from being a Frankish version of Roman decadence, is rather the logical (or illogical) conclusion to a specifi cally Frankish course of development. It is in the history of what Ernst Kantorowicz called “mediaeval political theology” that we fi nd plausible antecedents for Philip’s ambivalence toward the exertion of his royal will. First we will outline Kantorowicz’s insightful view that an Augustinian monophysitism was operative in the peculiar course of Western legal theory that led to Philip’s complex. Next we will undertake a brief reexamination of some aspects of Philip the Fair’s character, this time focusing on the specifi c Kantorowiczian “king’s two bodies” thesis, drawing conclusions and expansions that suggest themselves along the way. Ernst Kantorowicz is not the only scholar to note that both Continental and English traditions of medieval law were at least as dependent upon Chalcedonian Christological formulations as they were on any other written source, even Roman Law; but, he was the fi rst to see their origin in Blessed Augustine’s theology and he was the fi rst to draw far-reaching conclusions from this connection. Kantorowicz starts off in Medieval England, from whence he quotes Edmund Plowden’s Reports as saying the King has in him two Bodies, viz., a Body natural, and a Body politic. His Body natural…is…subject to all Infi rmities….

The Norman Anonymous proclaimed that the king was a twin person, one descending from nature, the other from grace…. One through which…he conformed with other men: another through which, by the eminence of [his] deifi cation and by the power of the sacrament [of consecration], he excelled all others. Concerning one personality, he was, by nature, an individual man: concerning his other personality, he was, by grace, a Christus, that is, a God-man.37 Kantorowicz goes on to show that the Norman Anonymous’s most likely source for his double hypostasis Christology with its concomitant royal “twinship” was the Toledan Councils of the sixth century. To the same locale and time (sixth century Spain) we can date the insertion of the fi lioque clause into the Nicene Creed and the rise of Adoptionism.38 This constitutes a direct line of infl uence from Adoptionism (which is Nestorian in its belief in a Christ from above which gradually comes to rest in the human body of Jesus) to the Norman Anonymous’s equally Nestorian “twin person” of Christ. Most shocking about the Anonymous’s Christology is its notion that the humanity of Christ is so separate from the divine nature that this human Christ must by all rights submit to the imperial offi ce, since the latter is identifi ed with the essence of Divine Justice: “It is as though the potestas of Tiberius qua Caesar were ‘haloed,’ whereas Christ, in his human serfdom, remains without halo.”39 The Anonymous’s extreme Nestorianism was indeed the proximal source for the idea of the king’s two bodies in Plowden and all of the other legal theorists cited by Kantorowicz; however, the German-born medievalist is not slow to point to the Anonymous’s precursors. Kantorowicz is amazed particularly at the frontispiece of the Aachen Gospels (ca. 975, fi g. 7, page 161) that goes far beyond the Carolingian conventions toward which it nods.

Holy Roman Emperor Otto is seated on a Carolingian-style throne, and he and his royal cathedra are depicted as being suspended in midair, the personifi cation of earth, Tellus, performing the Atlas-like duty of shouldering throne and Emperor. The Emperor is presented as christomimetes—he who acts as Christ, or he who mimics Christ—and another detail tips off the deeper meaning of the Aachen miniature: “the divine aureola framing the Hand of God [that rests upon Otto’s head] intersects with the imperial aureola, thus allowing the emperor’s head to be placed in the spandrel which is formed by the intersecting haloes.”40 Surely, this inter-halo tangent is the inspiration for (or at least it constitutes an early corroboration of) the Norman Anonymous’s notion of the king who has been “elevated even unto heaven…. (-) Truly, unto God he has been elevated…”.41 The mandorla of Christ, the four iconic animals representing the Four Gospels, the intersection of the Hand of God sphere and the Emperor’s head—it is important to note along with Kantorowicz that these details are alterations of the traditional iconographic representations of emperors in the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. Specifi cally, the Frankish commentators and artists we have mentioned—from the Aachen artist who produced the Codex in the tenth century to the Norman Anonymous at the beginning of the twelfth century (along with the inheritors of this tradition in modern times)—have changed the Chalcedonian Orthodox representation of Christ, which proclaimed that Christ was one person in two natures, meaning that man becomes united with Christ by grace or energy, the Son of God being the only Son of the Father by nature. The Nestorianism of the king’s two bodies says that the king has a physical body and a kingly body (the separation being stressed so absolutely as to include a bifurcated personality), and that the former may exhibit every weakness and shortcoming, but that the completely separate divine royal person remains perfect in justice and truth. Indeed, the sources cited above indicate that the king’s divine person was Christ by nature. Kantorowicz is not satisfi ed with these later interconnections, but proceeds to peel back yet another layer, which reveals Blessed Augustine of Hippo. Augustine’s Enarrationes in Psalmos, a commentary on Psalm 91 that became a foundational ecclesiastical text in the Christian West, contains many passages that one might say constitute a programme for Nestorian theory of kingship, most notably the following cluster of passages: “In this very tabernacle the emperor has", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Augustine’s Enarrationes in Psalmos, a commentary on Psalm 91 that became a foundational ecclesiastical text in the Christian West, contains many passages that one might say constitute a programme for Nestorian theory of kingship, most notably the following cluster of passages: “In this very tabernacle the emperor has militated for us. (-) He is far above all heavens, but his feet he has on earth. (-) But we should not believe that the head is separate from the body: there is a discretion in space, but a conjunction in love.”42 It is remarkable enough that these passages seem to be the main inspiration for the king’s two bodies theme in Western Imperial iconography. Here Joseph P. Farrell provides the deeper insight to Kantorowicz’s citation (though we cannot rule out that the myriad-minded German was aware of it as well) by pointing out that Augustine’s term “conjunction” is the same term used by Nestorius and many of his followers to indicate the nature of the contractual union between the human nature of Christ and His divine nature.43 Augustine did explicitly state that the word “tabernacle” was used in the 91st Psalm to indicate the fl esh of Christ. However, later iconographers and ecclesiastical writers in the West tended to use some of Augustine’s unfortunate word choices (as we noted above with “conjunction”) as well as the ambiguity of his formulations of Christological dogma, despite the African bishop’s Orthodox intentions. Icons informed by this Nestorianizing tradition of the disappearing Christ do not picture the entire body of Jesus Christ; only His feet are shown, the rest of Him being lost behind a cloud border that has replaced the fl esh of Christ as the newly conceived “tabernacle.”44 Now, to move the action ahead to the time of King Philip IV, let us note that Giles of Rome, a man who had the ear of the king, wrote the following in a work dedicated to Philip: “…[T]he king or prince is a kind of Law, and the Law is a kind of king or prince. For the Law is a kind of inanimate prince; the prince, however, a kind of animate Law. And in so far as the animate exceeds the inanimate the king or prince must exceed the Law.”45 Couple this notion of a king as a literal embodiment of an abstraction, Law, with another of Giles’s admonitions to Philip: “…[I]t is altogether fi tting that kings and princes exhibit themselves less than others and demonstrate that they are graver and more worthy of reverence than others, not for the sake of ostentation, but rather lest the royal dignity be scorned.”46 Giles above all counseled Philip not to appear “severe", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Another area where the connection is palpable between the Nestorianizing notion of the king’s two bodies and Philip the Fair is in the king’s regnal seals. Philip’s great seal, shown to the right of Philip’s father’s seal in fi gure 8, shows Philip the Fair’s head poking through the outer rim of the seal. Notice that Philip III’s seal also features the conventional Ottonian depiction of the royal head breaking out of the border, but Philip III’s expanding head is outdone by Philip IV’s, whose crown breaks not only the inner but also the outer rim of the seal. Elizabeth Brown notes the less wolfi sh and more imposing lions that fl ank the larger seal, and she also sets up our comparison with a similar seal of Philip’s: Further, on Philip the Fair’s great seal the four richly maned lions’ heads adorning the throne are clearly distinguishable from the longnecked wolf-like creatures portrayed on his father’s seal. It is doubtless no coincidence that the lion also appeared on Philip the Fair’s secret seal. The king of beasts, identifi ed with Jesus Christ, the symbol of magnanimity as well as vigilance and retributive justice, was a fi tting sign for Philip himself; he was surely aware of the lion’s attributes when he chose to associate it so prominently with himself.48 The secret seal of Philip the Fair (fi g. 9) to which Brown alludes is not only noteworthy because dominated by the lion image, but also because of its triadic shape. Specifi cally, the seal is in the shape of three interlocking rings, each ring containing its own triple ring that mirrors the larger trine. If we hearken back to our foregoing discussion of the Scutum fi dei and its fi lioquist trinitarian undergirding, interesting thought-vistas open. Figure 2 shows the double shield of faith, one representing the Holy Trinity, the other representing the parts of the human soul. Figure 6 shows a triple representation in that the Scutum containing the Father, Son and Holy Spirit stands beside an alchemical vessel with a white, a blue, and a red phoenix, which together form an Ouroboros.

Thus, fi gure 6 weds the spatial trinity of three Persons to a diachronic trinity that is identifi ed with the alchemical Great Work. In Philip the Fair’s secret seal we fi nd a Scutum-style confi guration of three trinities, which, each trine taken as ring in the metastructure, forms a larger trinity. The seal links this process-Scutum with a single image that threatens to envelop the entire surface of the image, a royal lion. It seems that this lion, representing at once both Jesus Christ and the Frankish king, is parallel logically and iconographically to the utterly simple divine essence of the Scutum fi dei, le point parfait marked “Deus.” We will now leave the curious subject of Philip the Fair’s personality with the following conclusion, which, it is hoped, speaks beyond its immediate application by drawing together the individual fi laments that, taken together, make up the cloth of this chapter: If Philip the Fair indeed saw himself as the divine lion that is both the radically simple divine essence and the process of divine development, then his neurosis has a theological counterpart in the Western trinitarian confusion of essence, energy and person. 2.

It is not being suggested that the West became Augustinian and then Francicised in a preordained, deterministic manner. Rather, it is held that once Augustine became the highest authority in the West, and since the Regnum Francorum increasingly prominent as an Augustinian Christian Empire, these forces worked together to create the kind of sociopolitical climate conducive to “king’s two bodies” monophysitism. 22. Strayer, Reign, x, xii-xiii. “Philip was the fi rst French king to impose general taxes, and he was surprisingly successful in this innovation. His tax of 1304 produced more money than any tax levied during the next half century” (xii). The thelemic ambiguity that, it is here argued, causes so much interpretive diffi culty as regards Philip’s action or lack thereof, is refl ected in the previously mentioned epithet “le bel.” The Florentine Dominican Remigio de’ Gerolami (d. 1319) preached a sermon that mentioned a “lady of Provence who called him dumb” (Trans. in D.L. D’Avray, Death and the Prince: Memorial Preaching before 1350 [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994], 80). Whether or not this epithet was honorifi c in its original intent, it is clear that the Florentine preacher has interpreted it as such. It certainly could be argued that Philip, who viewed the leading families of the outlying lands of the Frankish kingdom with unbounded contempt and sometimes objectifi ed these sentiments through his actions, was equally capable of inspiring either contempt (cf. Bsp. Saisset’s comments) or incomprehension from his many auditors. 27. For a refutation of the West’s notion of an Eastern Roman “caesaropapism,” see Deno J.

(-) The Byzantine inauguration ritual was never devised and managed exclusively by clerics. Its details were revised by the emperors themselves, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, ‘in whatever way each thinks fi t’” (271-272). As opposed to theRegnum Francorum, which was tension-ridden owing to its racial/economic divide between Franks (free nobles) and villains (unfree, non-Frankish serfs), the Eastern Roman Empire saw the entire society of persons as anointed, not just the higher clergy and the king, as in Frankish Civilization: “Conversely, [in the East,] the anointed, the Christian Romans, formed a single community, within which the emphasis was not on boundaries but on communications. Characteristic of Byzantine society were rituals of mass participation: the processions of the emperor or of relics or images through the great cities, the adventus, the acclamations in the vernacular of the crowds in the hippodromes, and in the great churches the elaborate preparation of chrism by the patriarch ‘before all the people.’ To the pure, all things are holy” (276). In Justinian’s view, the issue was not—as it is for us—in defi ning relations between ‘Church and ‘State,’ as two distinct social structures. For Justinian, in terms of geographical extension, general goals and membership, the two coincided. God’s will was to unite the ‘inhabited earth’…under Himself, as Creator and Savior. The Christian Roman emperor was entrusted with this task and in this sense he was accomplishing on earth the ministry of Christ himself. The Church, however, was to realize sacramentally that which was implied by the Christian faith. The people of God were therefore to be led by two distinct hierarchies: the one, responsible for external order, welfare, security and administration, and the other leading the people of God into the sacramental anticipation of the Kingdom of God. Their competencies were, therefore, distinct, but inseparable. Their activities and practical responsibilities necessarily overlapped. The bishops presided over the Eucharist and taught the faith, but the emperor alone could provide them with the means of getting together, of enjoying enough ‘good order’ to be able to exercise their ministry properly…. “There are two great gifts which God, in his love for man, has granted from on high: the priesthood…and the imperial dignity (Basileia).

The fi rst serves divine things, while the latter directs and administers human affairs; both, however, proceed from the same origin and adorn the life of mankind. Hence, nothing should be such a source of care to the emperors as the dignity of the priests, since it is for their (imperial) welfare that they constantly implore God. For if the priesthood is in every way free from blame and possesses access to God, and if the emperors administer equitably and judiciously the state entrusted to their care, general harmony (symphonia tis agathe) will result and whatever is benefi cial will be bestowed upon the human race.” What Justinian obviously could not—or would not—defi ne is how harmony or ‘symphony’ was to be established between the eschatological reality of the Kingdom of God, manifested in the Church and its sacraments, on the one hand, and, on the other, such ‘human affairs,’ inevitable in any society, as violence, war, social injustice, etc., which the state by itself is neither capable, no willing to avoid.

For what greater master can we fi nd than God, the author of the universe? And what more beautiful hymn can we sing to him than one in which the witness of things themselves expresses his praise?” Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, one of Germany’s most infl uential philosophers, was born on 1 July 1646 in Leipzig. As a youth he read widely in virtually every area of study, then took degrees in philosophy and law before traveling widely and, after many twists and turns, ending up as head librarian at the Court of Hanover under Duke Johann Friedrich (1625-1679). Before he died in 1716, Leibniz published several groundbreaking treatises in the fi elds of law, mathematics, theology, philosophy, and physics. He created the fi rst calculating machine that could perform all of the operations of basic arithmetic and he, independent of Sir Isaac Newton, discovered the laws of integral and differential calculus.1 Since space permits only a brief look at Leibniz’s work, the following statements on the philosopher’s background and infl uences will be selective. Leibniz attempts to construct an all-inclusive, encyclopedic system of knowledge to both 1) establish the rational basis of all the sciences and 2) provide reasonable proofs for the dogmas of Christianity. He starts by asking questions about the nature of knowledge itself: How can one arrive at truth, and what is the proper method for accepting rationally presented arguments? Once this method is established, Leibniz reasons, it should be applied to two areas, 1) the material realm of bodies—this is the world of science or natural philosophy—and 2) the world behind materiality—the spiritual world of monads. These realms—the physical and the metaphysical—can only be harmonized through the right philosophical method. Thus theory and praxis are bound together by Leibniz’s ecumenism, which is a rationaliste procedure par excellence. This essay aims to show that Leibniz’s ecumenism, far from being only a religious quest, rather is rooted in his universal philosophical method. As Nicholas Jolley concludes, “[i]t is not inappropriate, then, to seek to explain Leibniz’s enthusiasm for the project of ecumenism [merely] in terms of his deep metaphysical commitments.”2 The grandiosity of Leibniz’s cosmic ecumenism was certainly not unique in the world of seventeenth century thought, nor was his emphasis on a simple repeatable mental procedure that promised an amazing cure of social and spiritual ills.

Leibniz lived in the shadow of a group of irenicist Christian philosophers known as the Herborn encyclopedists—amongst them John Amos Comenius and Johann Heinrich Alsted—who exhibited great enthusiasm for simple pedagogical techniques believed to be gateways to a society completely free of social ills.3 The following analysis of Leibniz aims to show that the great German polymath’s cosmic ecumenism was more than just a compartment of his thought. Rather, an understanding of his ecumenism shows how Leibniz can be both extremely abstract and at the same time eminently practical in his various international schemes and in his philosophy.4 Much like Plato, who in the Laws outlined his vision of an ideal polis, all the while realizing tacitly that “[t]his blueprint as a whole [was] never likely to fi nd such favorable circumstances that every single detail [would] turn out precisely according to plan,” Leibniz’s overall goal of uniting God and creation in such a way that all created beings fi nd perfection and happiness in the essence of God, could be spoken of both in terms of the ultimate telos and also in terms of institutional compromise.5 To state things plainly, it is one and the same Leibniz who composed the inscrutable abstractions of Monadology and who wrote painstakingly detailed expositions on proper procedures and protocol at ecumenical conferences. The Germany of Leibniz’s youth reeled in the aftermath of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), an ordeal of unprecedented devastation that killed an estimated one third of the population. The Thirty Years War was in great measure caused by the religious factionalism of the Protestant Reformation, and this fact ensured that religious unifi cation and religious toleration would remain the most urgent international policy issues during these years. The social upheaval and religious splintering of the Reformation and its attendant wars left Europe in shock; many philosophers and theologians became millenarians or at the very least began to think more holistically. Social strife, a larger-than-life problem, could only be met with larger than life solutions, or so many believed. Some set about with gusto imagining allinclusive categories and their syntheses, anything to encourage the hope that the unmanageable chaos around them could be corralled into neat, circumscribable wholes. Leibniz, born into a devout Lutheran family that had also known success in the academic world, viewed theology, philosophy and politics as aspects of the same scientifi c quest.6 Faith and reason, many encyclopedists and holists believed, could heal all societal and confessional divisions and allow the attainment of the greatest good for all human beings. throw", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Leibniz, for instance, drank deep draughts of Scholastic theology at the University of Leipzig under his teacher Jakob Thomasius (1622-1684), who was nearly prevailed upon by his precocious student to support the reconciliation of the hidebound Aristotelianism of the schools with the modern philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, and Gassendi.8 In fact, Leibniz, far from being unique in his enthusiasm, was rather following a tradition of Aristotelian/modern science previously established by thinkers like Sir Kenelm Digby and Thomas Hobbes, a tradition that sought to take what was true and lasting in Aristotle and to reconcile it with the newly discovered mechanical philosophy. Next we will spend a few pages examining Leibniz’s critique of Cartesian matter theory, all the while relating its features to our present theme. For Descartes and many of his followers, matter was equivalent to extension.9 Essentially, they asserted that extension in space is the only property of bodies. Leibniz, reacting strongly against this Cartesian picture, proposed the following chain of propositions: 1) Things that are extended have parts and are thus divisible. 2) The ultimate base or bases of reality must be utterly simple, or else there is some thing that is simpler of which the former are composed.10 3) Therefore, extension is accidental, and pertains not to essence.11 An essence, according to Leibniz, must be a nonextended, totally simple unit, or “monad.”12 In order to better understand the reasons for and development of his critique of atomism and extension matter theory, we will now reproduce a few of Leibniz’s own words on the subject: At fi rst, after freeing myself from bondage to Aristotle, I accepted the void and the atoms, for it is these that best satisfy the imagination. But, in turning back to them after much thought, I perceived that it is impossible to fi nd the principles of a true unity in matter alone or in what is merely passive, since everything in it is but a collection or aggregation of parts to infi nity. Now a multitude can derive its reality only from the true unities, which have some other origin are entirely different from points.

Now a multitude can derive its reality only from the true unities, which have some other origin are entirely different from points. To fi nd these real unities, therefore, I was forced to have recourse to a formal atom, since a material being cannot be at the same time material and perfectly indivisible, or endowed with true unity.13 Here the atom’s extension in space is shown by Leibniz to offer no satisfactory answer to the question “what is the ground of unity which holds atoms together?” Leibniz, more apt to use good arguments from the past than to make up new ones, returns to the scholastic defi nition of substantia in his critique of the Cartesian res extensa.14 He rejects the Cartesian defi nition of the essence of matter as extension and qualities, for these two categories do not in any way account for how atoms or particles of matter cohere, nor for how they are regulated in complex organisms. This chain of logic leads Leibniz to a rather signifi cant proposition: “Extension” and “property,” since they both lack sentience, will, or any means whatsoever of carrying out intentions, cannot move matter, that is, they are not the source of their own movement. Other of Leibniz’s writings arrive at the same conclusion about extension as material essence, and are summed up nicely by Catherine Wilson: “A body is logically capable of assuming any shape and magnitude, [Leibniz] observes; hence the fact that it has the shape and size it does must be sought outside itself…”.15 Building upon his critique of atomism and Cartesian matter theory, Leibniz further proposes that body is neither substance nor essence because a substance, by defi nition, contains its own principle of action: “Since body is nothing other than matter and fi gure, and the cause of motion certainly cannot be understood either from matter or from fi gure, the cause of motion must be outside body.”16 Before we draw any further conclusions about his idiosyncratic approach to science, let us fi rst explore Leibniz’s most well known concept, that of the “formal atom,” or “monad,” all the while casting a backward glance at our foregoing discussion of Leibniz’s critical response to Cartesianism in particular and to atom theory in general. At the same time that he was virulently rejecting atomistic matter theory, Leibniz was becoming more and more enamored with Thomas Hobbes’ On Bodies, and he shared with the great English philosopher a common postulate about the Euclidean point: The point has no parts, or at least its parts are so small as to have no assignable magnitude.17", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Of course, in an academic climate ruled by scientistic fundamentalism, the ascription of ultimate meaning to a non-material cause is often seen as a slamming of the door on science in favor of religion. Today, however, some modern physicists have followed Leibniz in refusing to give matter its own category of existence, instead viewing matter as a particular aspect or mode of energy. At any rate, Leibniz’s religio-philosophical copula was the non-extended point, which stood in his mind as the only possible bridge between science and theology, physics and metaphysics. In order to see the implications of Leibniz’s non-extended point for the rest of his thought, we will next touch on the scholastic distinction between matter and form, which Leibniz insisted was not to be thrown out. He considered forms to be “mind-monads,” sentient emanations from the Divine Mind. It is diffi cult to explain Leibniz’s notion of form in terms of “scientifi c revolution” or “new science,” because his utilization of Neoplatonic concepts and strategies to connect the physical processes and realities of the material world to the spirit world is actually a variant on a long-established Scholastic practice.20 Thus, Leibnitz’s metaphysics is both revolutionary and conservative: Mechanical explanations must be used when describing the “how” of the material world and its processes, but the “why” or the “ultimate how” of every created being is simultaneously referred to the realm of spirit, of mind, which is perfectly ordered according to the unity of the Divine Mind.21 Leibniz believes that at the heart of every existing body is a point sans extension, a non-material atom. Leibniz himself readily admits that his nonextended points—which he later calls “monads”—are a reintroduction of Aristotle’s substantial form into physics!22 What Leibniz then does is quite bold, and, as we hinted above, should sound strangely familiar to our", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Vis viva constitutes both the soul-essence of monads as well as their activities and fi nal goals. Matter, for Leibniz, far from having an essence, is only a lower type of energy. Specifi cally, matter is nothing more than the passive power of beings to slow things down (in fact, bodies for Leibniz are not essences but “accidents”23). Above this passive power of matter is the active power or energy of God that is the basis of monads and which constitutes their ability to freely actualize God’s “preestablished harmony.”24 Several points should here be noted about Leibniz’s monadic energy, as well as its relation both to Leibniz’s overall work and to the history of natural philosophy and theology. This list aims at more than mere summary, as it incorporates teachings of Leibniz and elements of his scholastic background not developed above: 1. Vis viva is functionally similar to the medieval Roman Catholic doctrine of God’s supernatural grace/activity. A corollary to this “supernatural grace” teaching is the dogma of ideas in the mind of God that, according to Roman Catholic belief, exist in the Divine Essence as attributes of all created beings.25 Leibnizian vis viva and supernatural grace share a similar type of duality: 1) In relation to creation, the grace of God/vis viva actualizes the ideas/forms in the essence of God and which draw all things to God in the form of “created graces.”26 2) In relation to God’s own essence or mind, grace/vis viva can be seen as the movement or activity of the Persons of the Trinity toward the all-good and completely self-suffi cient Divine Essence. Though some of the specifi cs of this summary of scholastic grace theory may not be spelled out in his writings, Leibniz everywhere, in our view, uses the rich tradition of scholasticism to show how all monads move themselves because they are essentially ideas in God’s mind and are granted “force” or “grace” by God to move harmoniously and freely toward their beatifi c ends. 2. Thus, through his monadic philosophy Leibniz has preserved the freedom of both God and creation, and he has preserved the distinction between creation and God.

Further, he has explained how matter constitutes a real unity through its origin and grounding in the realm of immaterial souls and in the highest Soul, the Trinitarian God. 3. Leibniz sees matter as a secondary refl ection of the soul-world of monads, the soul-world of monads being a collection of thoughtforms in the mind of God. God is the One, this One being both the fi rst religious and the fi rst philosophical principle of St. Augustine, and as such the One is the Monad of monads and the apex of the great chain of being. The basis of Leibniz’s great chain of harmonious monads is the Neoplatonic Christianity of St. This section has tried to show the place of natural philosophy in Leibniz to be at once central and peripheral, for though natural science can bring us “happiness,” it is only because man as a sentient monad sees the Monad (God) refl ected there, and can ascend to the source of rational truth by developing his power of perception, which is tantamount to reason.28 The material world refl ects the One, and it has no essence of its own. However, it is the best of all possible worlds, and it is a true refl ection of the unity of God, this unity being the primary attribute of divinity. As for Leibniz’s relation to the new science of his day, Vennebusch offers a summation: “Leibniz combines acceptance of a consistent mechanism with a decisive rejection of an absolute mechanism. He accepts the thesis that all physical processes can be explained mechanically; but he also sees that one can, nevertheless, retain the teleological view handed down to us from antiquity…”.29 As we move into our next section, which deals with Leibniz’s ecumenism, it should be kept in mind that the great monadologist’s mechanical teleology, his scientifi c metaphysics, is based on a kind of Neoplatonic rationalism. The telos of humanity is a rational ascent to God, who is the only infi nitely rational being, and thus the only being totally free of materiality.30 Religious strife is the result of nonconformity to the perfect rationality of God. The same scientifi c rationality which allows us to predict the movements of bodies in space and time also exists as the ladder that leads to perfect eudaemonia, to complete satisfaction of all spiritual desires in God. G.J. Jordan calls Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz “the greatest supporter of Church unity that the world has yet known.”31 In her erudite intellectual biography of the great philosopher, Maria Rosa Antognazza speaks of Leibniz’s ecumenism as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

G.J. Jordan calls Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz “the greatest supporter of Church unity that the world has yet known.”31 In her erudite intellectual biography of the great philosopher, Maria Rosa Antognazza speaks of Leibniz’s ecumenism as the core of the overarching goal which spanned his whole life, the creation of “an all-embracing encyclopaedic plan of reform and advancement of the sciences for the promotion of the common good…”.32 In fact, as we hinted in the previous section, Leibniz’s encyclopedic project proposed to establish sciences such as mathematics, geometry, and physics on a sure footing by writing a completely clear and accurate set of rules and applications for accepting reasoned propositions. Once the proper rules were accepted, then controversies would subside. Leibniz’s second step is crucial, and gives us some idea of the intention and inspiration of his scientifi c ecumenism: The physical “sciences were not to be pursued as ends in themselves but as preconditions for the demonstration of the existence of God and the defense of the Christian mysteries. From the new philosophy of mind… which he was developing, Leibniz explained to Arnauld, he dared to promise ‘some considerable light’ on the defense of the controversial mysteries of the Trinity, the Incarnation, predestination, and the Eucharist.”33 The rules of reason properly established would end political, philosophical and religious controversies. Our consideration of Leibniz’s ecumenism will be bipartite. The fi rst section will analyze the “Regulae circa Christianorum omnium ecclesiasticam unionem,” a Leibnizian document that outlines procedural rules for church union. The Regulae was the result of an irenicist conference in which Leibniz played an integral role. In the second part, we will look at some secondary literature dealing with Leibniz’s plans for church reunion, paying extra attention to a signifi cant but heretofore unnoticed piece by Jean During Leibniz’s tenure as librarian of the ducal library, the Duke of Hanover Ernest Augustus summoned Lutheran irenics, including Gerhard Wolter Molanus and Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, to a conference with the Roman Catholic ecumenist Christopher Rojas de Spinola, Titular Bishop of Tina (Croatia) and afterwards (1686) Bishop of Neustadt.34 The gathering took place at the Hanoverian royal residence, and the document that resulted from it—“Regulae circa Christianorum omnium ecclesiasticam unionem”—was composed with the cooperation of Leibniz, who was then acting as an unoffi cial advisor to the group. After the drafting of the Regulae, Leibniz often expressed his full approval of the document in various epistolary and literary contexts.35 The Regulae proposed that both parties—Lutheran and Roman Catholic— should engineer a reunion of the churches by declaring themselves already united simply by virtue of their mutual acknowledgment of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Both groups were to move forward as “Old Catholics” and “New Catholics,” the latter being former Lutherans and the “Old Catholics” being former Roman Catholics. Occasional intercommunion would then be offered in select parishes where the clergy and laity were already sympathetic to the irenicist cause, these Lutherans and Catholics then pressing on under the assumption that the Council of Trent was suspended until a new ecumenical council could be called.36 Note the diplomatic genius of Leibniz and his collaborators’ three-part scheme, which may be listed as “1) assumption of unity, 2) intercommunion, and 3) appeal to council.” First of all, the scheme proposes that a small group of educated elites (a group already sympathetic to irenicism) hidden away from the turbulence of the public sphere proclaim a de facto union, even going so far as to call both groups “Catholic,” though distinguished by the labels “Old” and “New.” Ironically, this self-proclaimed authority, once given broader currency through scattered liturgical affi rmation, proposes to call an ecumenical council to straighten out the divisive and unacceptable aspects of the Council of Trent, since the latter council lacks ecumenicity. This plan allows the Lutherans, along with all other Reformist Protestants on the sidelines, to have the bottom-up reforms of the Church for which Luther and other “reasonable men” have clamored, since the initiative comes, not from Rome, but from Luther’s home base. On the other hand, the Roman Catholics are appeased because, in the fi nal analysis, authority resides within the principle of conciliarity, and nowhere does the Regulae indicate that a true ecumenical council is anything but the Pope and all the bishops gathered together to proclaim the mind of the Church. Other strategies are evinced in the text of the Regulae, which consists in a number of procedural rules for proper irenicist pursuits. Rule 1: “…[E]very Christian is bound to give his help as far as lies within his power and in accordance with the laws of God and man of those of the Diets of the Empire. Those who proclaim the opposite must be treated as heretics and as traitors.”37 Here the tactic is to redefi ne heresy as meaning “any opposition to the conference’s specifi c ecumenical program.” After all, the logic goes, opposing the reunion of Christendom is indefensible. Why would not any Christian wish to aid the effort at reunion? So, the Hanover group", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Why would not any Christian wish to aid the effort at reunion? So, the Hanover group has subtly established itself as the arbiter of the Church’s true boundary, and, in the group’s hands, this boundary separates whoever agrees with the Hanover program from everyone else in the world. Another of the Regulae’s strategies is to cite a particular Protestant sect’s practices which are similar to those of Roman Catholics in order to plea for tolerance of Roman practices as non-essential pieties. For example, those of the reformed Helevetic Confession “fall on their knees before the Eucharistic Bread and receive it in this posture.”38 The Hanover document’s logic on this point may be extrapolated thusly: As Protestants, we are currently tolerant of the Helvetians, and we have never once thought about denying that they are part of the Church. Roman Catholics, however, we often deem heretics because they venerate the Host. This unequal treatment, by defi nition, is prejudicial. To be consistent, we must tolerate the liturgical and eucharistic idiosyncrasies of the Roman Catholics in the same way that we tolerate those of the Helvetic Confession. A third trend is also found in the Regulae—we can name it dogmatic utilitarianism. According to this principle certain changes to tradition are foregone (at least as a stage preliminary to their introduction) due to the prejudice of the people.39 Though a practice may be correct and even necessary, its use must be dictated by what will be accepted by a group of worshippers, and any pious practice or teaching must be weighed against its purported reception by the laity: “…Catholics will not endure an immediate abolition of their forms of prayer, liturgy and ceremonies; nor will they be obliged to receive the Sacrament from the hands of a priest whom they deem to be of doubtful Orders.”40 Here we will draw a tentative conclusion about Leibniz’s scientifi c rationalism and its application in his ecumenist efforts, though it must be stressed that this is intended as nothing more than a possible direction for further research. Just as Leibniz seems to favor a Neoplatonic valuation of a spiritual/noetic world over an “accidental” material world, so he has no problem justifying the alteration of external ritual practices to serve the greater goal of spiritual, inner Church unity.41 Leibniz in many places assumes a dichotomy between an Inner and an outer Church, and it is obvious that he, to some degree, aligns this Inner/outer Church binary with his Platonic mind/matter opposition, the latter", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Jean Guitton’s “Leibniz and Pascal: Protestantism, Catholicism and Ecumenicism”43 seeks to understand Leibniz’s ecumenism in the context of his attitudes toward the science of his day (17th century). In this wise, Guitton’s focus could not be more germane to our purpose, since his essay analyzes the connection between the two aspects of Leibniz’s thought— ecumenism and science—that have been the subjects of the preceding two chapters of this section. First of all, Guitton establishes Leibniz’s lifelong fascination with and idealization of the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuit Order. Specifi cally, Guitton notes that Leibniz believed the Jesuit order to be, at least in its inner inspiration and purpose, the key to Church unity—and along with it, the unity of society as a whole—in a scientifi c age that was growing more and more suspicious of both a heavy-handed Roman Church and an equally directionless Protestantism: The Jesuit institution, far from representing in his eyes the most perfi dious opposition to the true Christian spirit and the mentality of the Early Church, is the most remarkable development of this primitive Christianity. The faults of the Society, as serious as they are, are extrinsic. Intrinsically the order is sound. And, if this order had been reformed along the lines of its essential character, it could have procured for the Apostolate means of an expansion which meet modern requirements in its double mission, interior and exterior.44 Guitton points out Leibniz’s desire to see the formation of a Jesuit-styled super-order, a “more comprehensive Order” which would incorporate all of the best elements of each of the existing Catholic orders into a single group. It is obvious that Leibniz saw the best elements of Christianity as 1) its compatibility with reason and science and 2) its hierarchical organization, with bishops, orders and Pope at the apex of the structure.

Here we will supply a lengthy quotation to give the reader a feel for Guitton’s presentation of Leibniz’s thinking on this most important of subjects: Leibniz had carefully analyzed the concept of religious order. He had worked out the conditions of the perfect adaptation of these orders to their end which, in his eyes, was the most effi cacious realization of the Divine Plan. Leibniz’s plan was to keep what was best in each existing order, then to incorporate these best elements into a more comprehensive Order. At the same time, each of the existing orders (at least those which were long established) was to profi t by the current spirit which was a spirit of reason and science. Leibniz dreamed of a Church where the Cistercians would be also naturalists, where the mendicant orders were also physicians, the contemplatives also mathematicians, the learned orders also historians, the missionaries also linguists, the theologians also critics, the liturgists also lovers of nature and its cycles. Leibniz feared that, with religious, all powers of observation were confi ned to their liturgical and pastoral duties in the narrow grooves understood as proper to those offi ces before the dawn of the scientifi c age. Leibniz hoped that the fi ndings of science “would be no less understood than others in apostolic activities.” “It is not required,” he wrote to Père Jergus, “that they spend their whole time in the confessional or thinking out sermons and cases of conscience.” Leibniz would advise a division of labor, one contingent setting out on the Propagation of faith by missions, the other on the Justifi cation of faith through science. He was even scheming, it was said, to combine the orders into one Supreme Order, a super-Order, the order of Charity: Instituatur Societas sive ordo caritatis, composi tus ex contemplativis et activis; and from this order the pope would be chosen.45 If we follow Leibniz’s logic as presented by Guitton, it becomes diffi cult to avoid the following conclusion: Leibniz wanted to see a seamless integration of science with a superorder-led Christianity. Perhaps Leibniz believed that, once the completely rational superorder was in place, then the whole wide world of reasonable, scientifi c culture (including the Protestants) would have no problem accepting a pope who was primes inter pares in a society aligned totally with the same rational principles to which everyone already adhered.46 Guitton expounds the further theological implications of Leibniz’s scientifi c ecumenism: “[For Leibniz], the application of reason to nature was going to replace the older theology which had been, for the most part, an application of reason to grace.”47 This", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

We have concluded that the “monad” notion is inspired by the “astral body” category of Renaisssance Neoplatonism and also by the Euclidean theory that was still central to many of Leibniz’s contemporaries. Further, we have suggested that the same Neoplatonic metaphysic which led to Leibniz’s monad also led to his valuation of imagined immaterial essentials and his devaluation of ritual and “externals” which did not correspond to Leibniz’s idiosyncratic conception of a scientifi c super-order which would supply the only possible all-embracing socioreligious bond. Throughout our analysis it has been shown that Leibniz’s science cannot be considered apart from his theology, specifi cally his rationalistic ecumenism. 3. See Leroy E. Loemaker, “Leibniz and the Herborn Encyclopedists,” Journal of the History of Ideas 22.3 (July-Sept 1961), 323-338. On Comenius’s theology of conversion, see Howard Louthan, “Introduction,” in John Comenius: The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1998), 7-54, where Louthan, esp. p. 19ff., outlines Comenius’s “pansophism” as it relates to Comenius’s scheme of universal Christian education. In short, Comenius believed that Roman Catholic Christianity was corrupted through the scholastic system of abstract concepts. This scholastic system of dialectical concepts was the antithesis of Adamic “naming.” Comenius sought to reestablish pure Adamic pedagogy through simple moral lessons linked to picture games that he believed built literal, empirical bridges between words, on one hand; and objects and processes in nature, on the other. According to Comenius, these “picture games,” with their Pietistic moral lessons gleaned from simple observations of the senses, revealed the unitary wisdom of God, to which all would submit if they followed the Comenian pedagogy.

Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People, 2nd ed. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2004 [1972]), 450. Note that Scott explained the necessity of baptism as having a purely logical character, being the natural conclusion that follows unavoidably from faith in Christ! On the epistemological side of things: Alstead called his Augustino-Platonic theory of knowledge a “circle of the universe” which starts from logical fi rst principles, descends in a Baconian manner to particulars, then “ascends from sense and singular things to universals; the resulting circular motion [being] perfection” (Loemaker, “Herborn,” 326). Alstead’s process is based in the same kind of logico-metaphysical dialectic that is in its main points identical to Leibniz’s theory of knowledge in each of its phases. 6. Nicholas Jolley notes that Leibniz referred to his Church not as “Lutheran” but rather “Evangelical” (Jolley, “Leibniz, Locke,” 134). From the Reformation era until today, many commonly referred to as Lutherans have preferred the less sectarian Evangelisch, esp. as the Church in Germany has been named offi cially Deutsche Evangelische Kirche since 1933, In 1817, Frederick William III of Prussia, wishing to end the confl ict between Lutherans and Reformed in his kingdom, forcibly united them under a single name—Evengelical Church of the Prussian Union. For background see William Benton, “Lutheran Churches,” in The New Encyclopaedia Britannica in Thirty Volumes, 15th ed. 11.198. 7. See John Henry, “Atomism and Eschatology: Catholicism and Natural Philosophy in the Interregnum,” British Journal for the History of Science 15.3 (1982), 211-239. Though the main thrust of his argument pertains to the “Merton thesis”‡ about the Puritan origins of the “new philosophy,” Henry also seeks to show the complex and reciprocal relationship between scholasticism and seventeenth century science. Most pertinent for our purposes is Henry’s point that Catholic thinkers like Sir Kenelm Digby and Fr. Thomas White developed Aristotelian philosophical systems that were both atomistic and mechanical (213)! Leibniz was infl uenced by Digby and White, as noted by Nicholas Jolley (The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz, ed. N. Jolley, 64).

Copenhaver does a superlative job in explicating the connection between Aristotelian philosophy and the Renaissance belief in an original linguistic transparence. The latter amounted to a hermetic Eunomianism that led its proponents to ferret out ancient manuscripts in the hopes of unearthing a purer language, one that had divine, Edenic power (406). ‡ The “Merton thesis.” In 1938 Robert K. Merton published Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth-Century England (New York: Harper and Row, 1970; orig. pub. Osiris 4.2 [1938]: 414- 565), which caused great controversy with its assertion that a Puritan ethic of God-directed, utilitarian empiricism, with a concomitant indifference toward medieval scholasticism and its web of rules and defi nitions, accounted for the great number of Englishmen who excelled in natural philosophy during the 1600s.

The following passage is particularly germane to our argument: “… Leibniz held that the essence of body is extension and impenetrability, as many mechanists did. However, unlike run-of-the-mill mechanists, Leibniz combined this view with an Aristotelian view of substance, holding that only constitute substances when taken together with concurrent minds, in particular, the mind of God, who is the source of activity in the world” (273). 21. “Thanks to the ‘admirable’ progress of science recorded in his own century, [Leibniz] argued, it had ‘become apparent that mechanical explanations—reasons from the fi gure and motion of bodies, as it were—can be given for most of the things which the ancients referred only to the Creator or to some kind…of incorporeal forms.’ (-) The key to avoiding the apparent atheistic consequences of modern science was to be found in the distinction between mechanical and metaphysical explanations of the universe, the latter of which began where ‘mechanism’ left off and then dug deeper to arrive at ‘foundations and principles.’ Rather than rejecting mechanical explanations of phenomena altogether…, Leibniz proposed merely to reject the premature claim that bodies were self-suffi cient and could exist without an incorporeal principle” (Antognazza, Leibniz, 102, interior citation from DA 6.1.490). 25.

From Augustine, Loemaker attests, the notion of a Christian God full of accessible ideas is carried through the Franciscans, Nicholas Cusanus, and the Renaissance Neoplatonists to Leibniz via the Herborn encyclopedists. 26. Leibniz in countless places expounds his variant on the Augustinian/scholastic mysticism of man’s mind as a refl ection of ideas in the essence of God. The following quotation shows Leibniz’s Roman Catholic “Idea mysticism,” which the great German polymath discusses in the context of Malebranche’s notion, irresistible to the Hermetically inclined Leibniz, that humans think all of their thoughts through God’s ideas! “As to whether we see all things in God…or whether all ideas are our own, we must realize that even if we do see all things in God, it is still necessary for the ideas through which we see to be our own at the same time; that is, our ideas are not little replicas, so to speak, but affections or modifi cations corresponding to what we perceive in God” (Wiener, Selections, 289-290). In On the Ultimate Origin of Things, Leibniz speaks of the ideas of all created beings as existing inside the essence of God: “They [the essences of things or the possibles] exist in a certain region of ideas, if I may thus speak, that is in God himself” (Cited in William E. May, “The God of Leibniz,” New Scholasticism 36 (1962), 506-528, at 519, note 50). On Leibniz’s hermetic proclivities see the number of insightful essays in Allison Coudert, Richard Henry Popkin, and Gordon M. Weiner (eds.), Leibniz, Mysticism, and Religion (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998). 27. Leibniz’s own words can be used to show that his Neoplatonic sympathy was deeply felt since his childhood: “As a boy I studied Aristotle, and even the Scholastics were not repulsive to my tastes…. But at that time Plato, and with him Plotinus, gave me especial joy” (Lettre a Mortmort, in God. Guil. Leibnitii opera philosophica quae extant latine, gallica, germainica omnia, ed. J.E. Erdmann [Berlin, 1840], 701-702. Cited in J. Politella, Platonism, Aristotelianism, and Cabalism in the Philosophy of Leibniz [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1938], 11). 32.

Not only at Hanover in 1683, but also in many of the religious negotiations in which he was involved, Leibniz “remained at the backstage, letting the offi cial initiatives [such as Spinola] play the leading role. In particular, he took care of the methodological, historical, and doctrinal aspects of the debates. He was, however, an important fi gure in such negotiations and spent an enormous amount of work in them” (xxix). 39. Txetxu Ausín explicitly links Leibniz’s irenicism with an “[e]thical consequentialism, close to some utilitarian approaches….” (“Weighing and Gradualism in Leibniz as Instruments for the Analysis of Normative Confl icts,” Studia Leibnitiana 37.1 (2005), 99-111, at 106; see also idem, “The Quest for Rationalism Without Dogmas in Lebniz and Toulmin,” in D. Hitchcock and B. Verheff (eds.), Arguing on the Toulmin Model: New Essays in Argument Analysis and Evaluation [Dordrecht: Springer, 2006], 261-272, at 266). 41. A similar conclusion about Leibniz’s devaluation of ritual and other “externals” of the Christian faith is reached by Steven Nadler in his The Best of All Possible Worlds: A Story of Philosophers, God, and Evil (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008): “Much of the problem, [Leibniz] insisted, lay not in basic dogma but in the particular, nonessential beliefs and customs that had developed within each tradition. ‘Most of the objections that can be made against Rome regard the practice of the people rather than the dogmas,’ he wrote in 1682. If only one could discover and properly interpret the core beliefs that unite all Christians—and distill them from the layers of ecclesiastic organization, ceremonial observance, and sectarian understanding within which they had become encrusted—there would be a possibility of reuniting the faithful within a single church” (10). It cannot be doubted that Leibniz’s “spiritualist” tendency in theology comes from his Hermetico-Platonic view of matter as “of the same kind as the monad or else…a nothing, a privation, a ghostly limit,” as R.E. Butts holds in his insightful piece “Leibniz’ Monads: A Heritage of Gnosticism and a Source of Rational Science,” Canadian Journal of Philosophy 10.1 (March 1980): 47-62, at 52. 42. See the following, from a letter written by Leibniz to the Landgrave Ernest dated January 1684: “I believe that a person may be a member of the Invisible Communion of the Church Catholic without being in the Visible Church; as when a person is unjustly excommunicated by an error or by the malice of the Judge” (ibid., 39). 44.

Ibid., 17. Donald F. Lach’s “Leibniz and China” (Journal of the History of Ideas 6.4 [October 1945], 436-455) gives us a clue as to the reason for Leibniz’s fi xation on the Jesuit order. He apparently saw in the Jesuits’ ecumenist strategy toward China a template for all Christian missionary endeavors. The Jesuits did not ask the Chinese to abandon their cultural traditions, specifi cally their Confucian social organization. Leibniz went a step further, considering the Confucian cultural achievement to be the greatest development of natural theology, while European Christianity was the height of revealed theology (441). 46. Guitton emphasizes that Leibniz was prescient in seeing that if the Church did not adapt itself to the then-new scientifi c paradigm, then modern man would leave the Church behind. On this theme, he quotes one of Leibniz’s letters to Antoine Arnauld: “Today’s most crying need is a very profound knowledge of religion. Why? Because a philosophical age is opening where, in the natural and logical course of events, insistence on absolute accuracy in detail is going to spread from the classrooms out into every walk of life. If we cannot satisfy this demand for exact knowledge, the genuine propagation of religion must be abandoned. Very soon the majority of men will be Christian only in externals; enterprising persons with bad spirit will work for the destruction of the faith. Atheism with naturalism will be popular heresies” (ibid., 19). What is the distinguishing mark of digital technology? It is based upon a fundamental opposition between $\" 0 \"$ and “1.” The former is “off,” the latter “on.” Leibniz, who was shocked to discover what he believed to be a protodigital code in the I-Ching’s broken and unbroken lines, viewed the digital dyad as a process. “Explication de l’arithmetique binaire,” Leibniz’s presentation of binary arithmetic appeared in 1703, and was “the fi rst public presentation on this topic to result in a signifi cant impact on the scientifi c community.” ℶ Boole and the great minds at Bell Labs—in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively—connected the necessary dots, and the seemingly infi nite practical applications of binary code began to become apparent.

Who, indeed, would gainsay that computers and the microprocessors that undergird modern machines have wrought such a sea-change in our lives? But are these amazing technological advances based only on Leibniz’s mathematical insights, or do they also retain a link with the great German thinker’s metaphysics? Would G.W. Leibniz have partitioned off his mathematics (with its applications in the world of engineering) from his theology? Let us consider Leibniz’s plan for a “binary medallion,” which he revealed in his letter of January 2, 1697 to Rudolph August, Duke of Brunswick. Though lengthy, our excerpt gives us the kind of detail we need to make the proper assessment of Leibniz’s binary arithmetaphysics: And so that I won’t come entirely empty-handed this time, I enclose a design of that which I had the pleasure of discussing with you recently. It is in the form of a memorial coin or medallion; and though the design is mediocre and can be improved in accordance with your judgment, the thing is such, that it would be worth showing in silver now and unto future generations, if it were struck at your Highness’s command. Because one of the main points of the Christian Faith, and among those points that have penetrated least into the minds of the worldly-wise and that are diffi cult to make with the heathen is the creation of all things out of nothing through God’s omnipotence, it might be said that nothing is a better analogy to, or even demonstration of such creation than the origin of numbers as here represented, using only unity and zero or nothing. And it would be diffi cult to fi nd a better illustration of this secret in nature or philosophy; hence I have set on the medallion design IMAGO CREATONIS [in the image of creation]. It is no less remarkable that there appears therefrom, not only that God made everything from nothing, but also that everything that He made was good; as we can see here, with out own eyes, in this image of creation. Because instead of there appearing no particular order or pattern, as in the common representation of numbers, there appears here in contrast a wonderful order and harmony which cannot be improved upon. Inasmuch as the rule of alternation provides for continuation, so that one can write without computation or the aid of memory as far as one wishes, if one alternates the last place 0,1,0,1,0,1, etc., putting these under each other; and then putting under each other in the second place (from the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

Such harmonious order and beauty can be seen in the small table on the medallion up to 16 or 17; since for a larger table, say to 32, there is not enough room. One can further see that the disorder, which one imagines in the work of God, is but apparent; that if one looks at the matter with the proper perspective, there appears symmetry, which encourages one more and more to love and praise the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the highest good, from which all goodness and beauty has fl own. I am corresponding with Jesuit Father Grimaldi, who is currently in China and also president of the Mathematics Tribunal there, with whom I became acquainted in Rome, and who wrote me during his return trip to China from Goa. I have found it appropriate to communicate to him these number representations in the hope, since he had told me himself that the monarch of this mighty empire was a lover of the art of arithmetic and that he had learned to fi gure the European way from Father Verbiest, Grimaldi’s predecessor, that it might be this image of the secret of creation which might serve to show him more and more the excellence of the Christian faith. So that I may explain the rest of the medallion I marked the main places, namely 10 or 2, 100 or 4, 1000 or 8, 10000 or 16, with * or an asterisk, because if one takes note of these, one is bound to see the origin of the remaining numbers. For example, why 1101 stands before 13 is shown by this demonstration: However, as Part 3 demonstrated, if we consider Leibniz’s philosophical writings, we see many connections to the Platonized Christianity that, in its various permutations, has guided (even constituted) Western theology from Augustine of Hippo to the present. Thus, Leibniz defi nitely believes in an analogia entis, a true ontological analogy between creation and the Creator. In light of this, we can add a fourth context and a fi fth context for the binary medallion’s 0-1 model: 4) the pattern of the unfolding of all created beings; and 5) the pattern of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

In light of this, we can add a fourth context and a fi fth context for the binary medallion’s 0-1 model: 4) the pattern of the unfolding of all created beings; and 5) the pattern of the infolded being of the Persons of the Trinity. Moreover, Leibniz’s sketch of the binary medallion links modern technology to our starting point: alchemy. The sky depicted in the sketch has the sun and moon in the left and right halves of the sky. In alchemical symbolism, this “sun and moon sky” indicates the deifi cation of matter and man as the fruit of the Great Work. I envisioned this, the book’s concluding section, as an answer to the anticipated query, “why should anyone living in the here and now care about all of this?” Let us look no further than our own computers for a ready answer. Specifi cally, observe the pixels on your computer screen (and notice, I need not ask if you have a computer, just as, forty years ago, one might have written “look outside at your automobile…”). We look at photographs and fi lms that seem to be real, that is, we think we are looking through a window or some foot-wide peephole in the same manner that we take in the world with our eyes. However, our computer screens present to our eyes nothing more than a grid of tiny square cells. So, a few words about these monochrome squares: Each cell’s color can be either one of the three primary ones, or it can be white, or it can be black, or it can be some mixture of primaries and/or white/black. Without going into technical details, let us note that an 8-bit pixel has 255 different possible shades. These 255 possibilities are different states between 0 (color completely off, or black) and 255 (color completely on). Look at this discontinuous digital continuum as a string of 255 different combinations of “ons” and “offs” on a switch box that has 8 switches on it. For 24-bit pixel technology, as found in the latest digital cameras and such, there are 3 such switch boxes (with a total of 24 switches), one for each primary color. The point is that the most complex, lifelike simulacra imaginable (home movies or digital photos taken of family and friends, for instance), when you dig deep enough, fi nd their origin in a large set of 0-1 choices. The following defi nition of ”digital,” taken from the Internet, puts us on the trail of further insights: Describes any system based on discontinuous data or events.

The following defi nition of ”digital,” taken from the Internet, puts us on the trail of further insights: Describes any system based on discontinuous data or events. Computers are digital machines because at their most basic level they can distinguish between just two values, 0 and 1, or off and on. There is no simple way to represent all the values in between, such as 0.25. All data that a computer processes must be encoded digitally, as a series of zeroes and ones. The opposite of digital is analog. A typical analog device is a clock in which the hands move continuously around the face. Such a clock is capable of indicating every possible time of day. In contrast, a digital clock is capable of representing only a fi nite number of times (every tenth of a second, for example). In general, humans experience the world analogically. Vision, for example, is an analog experience because we perceive infi nitely smooth gradations of shapes and colors. Most analog events, however, can be simulated digitally. Photographs in newspapers, for instance, consist of an array of dots that are either black or white. From afar, the viewer does not see the dots (the digital form), but only lines and shading, which appear to be continuous. Although digital representations are approximations of analog events, they are useful because they are relatively easy to store and manipulate electronically. The trick is in converting from analog to digital, and back again.3 It is interesting to note—in light of this passage and the Leibniz letter—that physicalists and reductionists who write polemical attacks on religion would seem to agree with Leibniz that complex processes in nature are “reducible” rather than “emergent” in that they do not represent anything qualitatively new, but rather seem so from the limited nature of our senses and mental processes (and Leibniz, as we will see, thinks that all of the possibilities of each atom’s nature are enfolded inside it!). For instance, as John R. Searle once explained in an interview, we sense water fl owing through our hands as wet, but “wet” is not a property of individual atoms of H2O, but rather refers to how a mass of water feels as millions of atoms of it course over our skin. In a sense, emergent properties do not “exist” outside of the minds/senses of those who experience them. This same notion is employed by Searle and others who believe that consciousness and all “higher level” reality is a kind of trick that our bodies play on us by giving us a strong sense that there are", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Antatomyzing Divinity - James L.

This same notion is employed by Searle and others who believe that consciousness and all “higher level” reality is a kind of trick that our bodies play on us by giving us a strong sense that there are qualitatively different levels of reality, when in actuality there are only atoms and the void. Technology seems to constitute support for the “non-emergence” model, since a computer’s mind-bogglingly complex operations can be reduced to the 0-1 metabinary. When the argument for reductionism is posed with this technological metaphor, we are left with either accepting reductionism or positing a “ghost in the machine,” or some equally arbitrary supernatural emergence. I mean, honestly, could anyone actually believe that computer assembly lines are, in any sense of the word, soul factories? However, Leibniz’s notion of “monads,” which in one sense agrees with the reductionists, upon further scrutiny turns out to be a wrench in their gears. Let us paraphrase Leibniz’s thoughts: Material reality is composed of monads—non-material “unities”—that are “windowless” in that they cannot be penetrated by any other monad or created being. These monads are immaterial, or at least the simplest material things imaginable. If there are computers, societies, and ecosystems that exist, this is not merely because new properties emerge (or, as reductionists would have it, seem to emerge) from atoms, but also because God has placed within each monad all of the possibilities of its individual development. In fact, God has harmonized all of the possible developmental paths of all monads through his predeterminations, though He does not coerce but rather “inclines” each monad toward its telos. Thus, though no monad has “contact” with any other monad, every conscious being experiences the outside world and other beings as if they are interacting. In fact, Leibniz believes that humans do freely interact, but their monads, being immaterial, do not affect one another internally. The material world is not an illusion in Leibniz’s scheme, but it defi nitely is not a direct window into the interiors of monads, though the natural world does refl ect the “pre-established harmony” established and maintained by God.

But in fact, this statist system is a reflection of the Hegelian ideas brought to the United States by the Skull and Bones “troika” of Gilman, White and Dwight, and then financed by Rockefeller. Today in California, one can see in real time the use of controlled conflict to achieve a desired outcome. The debate over the energy cri‑ sis is carefully contained to a debate over price caps and price control. Republicans want no caps and no controls. Most Democrats want price controls through caps. In fact, the existence of free energy systems just down the road is the reason for the controlled debate. Mills Blacklight Power now has its patents and some utilities have already bought in. Bearden’s MEG energy from space, is under discussion. Working models exist. The maligned cold fu‑ sion has hundreds of successful experiments, but so far as we know, cannot be repeated with sufficient assurance. Other systems have come into the view of government agencies, and then disappear from sight. A knowing public would ask, Why are these not included in the discussion?” — Simple. Because the utilities know they are for real, and only a few years down the road. The problem for utilities is not the price of energy today, but how to dump their fixed assets (hydro plants, transmission lines, etc.) onto the public. These “valuable” assets will have zero value down the road, because all new systems are stand‑alone units which don’t need fixed plant and transmission lines. If the public is aware of the dilemma of the utilities, the ability to dump assets onto the State is heavily reduced. We need a lot less propaganda for “education” and a more individual creative search for learning. Instead of more money for education, we need to allocate a lot less. The existing system of education is little more than a conditioning mechanism. It has little to do with education in the true sense, and a lot to do with control of the individual. During the past one hundred years any theory of history or historical evidence that falls outside a pattern established by the American Historical Association and the major foundations with their grantmaking power has been attacked or rejected - not on the basis of any evidence presented,but on the basis of the acceptability of the argument to the so-called Eastern Liberal Establishment and its official historical line. There is an Establishment history,an official history,which dominates history textbooks,trade publishing,the media and library shelves.The official line always assumes that events such as wars,revolutions,scandals,assassinations,are more or less random unconnected events.By definition events can NEVER be the result of a conspiracy，they can never result from premeditated planned group action.An excellent example is the Kennedy assassination when,within 9 hours of the Dallas tragedy, TV", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:0:44dcbfb4e8cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4455, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "basis of the acceptability of the argument to the so-called Eastern Liberal Establishment and its official historical line.

Just to ensure the official line dominates,in 1946 the Rockefeller Foundation allotted $139, 000 for an official history of World War Two. This to avoid a repeat of debunking history books which embarrassed the Establishment after World War One.The reader will be interested to know that The Order we are about to investigate had great foresight, back in the 1880s,to create both the American Historical Association and the American Economic Association (most economists were then more historians than analysts) under their terms,with their people and their objectives.Andrew Dickson White was a member of The Order and the first President of the American Historical Association. Times have changed. The weaknesses, inconsistencies and plain untruths in official history have surfaced.In the 198Os it is rare to find a thinking reader who accepts official history.Most believe it has been more or less packaged for mass consumption by naive or greedy historians. Although an historian who will stick out his neck and buck the trend is rare, some who do are victims of an even deeper game. Conspiracy then is an accepted explanation for many events at the intelligent grass roots level, that level furthest removed from the influence of The Order.We can cite at random the Kennedy assassination where the official “lone gunman” theory was never accepted by Americans in the street;Watergate,where a “deep throat” informer and erased tapes reek of conspiracy,and Pearl Harbor,where Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Major General Walter C. Short took the rap for General George C.Marshall and President Franklin D.Roosevelt. Which brings us to methodology.In this volume we will present three hypotheses.What isa hypothesis?A hypothesis is a theory,a working theory,a start point,which has to be supported by evidence.We arrived at these three hypotheses by examining certain documents which will also be described. The official history hatchet mongers will scream that our hypotheses are now being presented as proven assertions - and whatever we write here will not stop the screams.But again,these are only hypotheses at this point,they have to be supported with evidence.

They are a first step in a logical research process. Now in scientific methodology a hypothesis can be proven. It cannot be disproven. It is up to the reader to decide whether the evidence presented later supports，or does not support，the hypotheses.Obviously no one author,critic,or reader can decide either way until all the evidence has been presented. Firstly,in science the simplest explanation to a problem is always the most acceptable solution.By contrast, in establishment history,a simple answer is usually criticized as“simplistic.”What the critic implies is“The poor writer hasn’t used all the facts,” In other words,it’s a cheap“put-down” without the necessity of providing an alternate answer, or additional facts. Using this methodology we are going to argue and present detailed precise evidence (including names.dates and places) that the only reasonable explanation for recent history in the United States is that there exists a conspiracy to use political power for ends which are inconsistent with the Constitution. This is known by the official historians as the \"devil theory of history.’ which again is a quick, cheap device for brushing facts under the rug. However. these critics ignore, for example,the Sherman Act.i.e. the anti-trust laws where conspiracy is the basic accepted theory. If there can be a conspiracy in the market place、then why not in the political arena? Are politicians any purer than businessmen? Following the anti-trust laws we know that conspiracy can only be proven in a specific manner. A similar pattern of market actions is not proof of conspiracy. Just because something looks like a duck walks like a duck,and all the ducks act similarly. does not make it a duck - or a conspiracy. Under the Sherman Act a similar pattern of prices.where all prices are the same, is not proof of conspiracy. Similarity of prices can occur in a purely competitive market. Neither is similar political action necessarily a conspiracy. Widely accepted explanations of recent history based on a conspiracy theory do not present evidence that fits the above criteria.For example, the Council on Foreign Relations cannot be claimed as a conspiracy even for the period since its founding in 1921.Membership in the CFR is not a secret. Membership lists are freely available for the cost of a postage stamp. There is no proof that the entire membership conspires to commit illegal acts. Members of the CFR.when accused of being involved in a con-spiracy, have protested to the contrary. And by and large they are right.

Most CFR members are not involved in a conspiracy and have no knowledge of any conspiracy. And some personally known to the author are about the last people on earth to get involved in an ilegal conspiracy. HOWEVER,there is a group WITHIN the Council of Foreign Relations which belongs to a secret society，sworn to secrecy，and which more or less controls the CFR.CFR meetings are used for their own purposes,i.e., to push out ideas, to weigh up people who might be useful, to use meetings as a forum for discussion. Those on the inside know it as The Order. Others have known it for more than 150 vears as Chapter 322 of a German secret society.More formally,for legal purposes,The Order was incorporated as The Russell Trust in 1856. It was also once known as the “Brotherhood of Death.” Those who make light of it, or want to make fun of it, call it “Skull & Bones,” or just plain “Bones.” The American chapter of this German order was founded in 1833 at Yale University by General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft who， in 1876,became Secretary of War in the Grant Administra-tion.Alphonso Taft was the father of William Howard Taft,the only man to be both President and Chief Justice of the United States. The Order is not just another campus Greek letter fraternal society with passwords and handgrips，common to most campuses.Chapter 322 is a secret society whose members are sworn to silence.It only ex-ists on the Yale campus (that we know about).It has rules. It has ceremonial rites. It is not at all happy with prying,probing citizens - known among initiates as “outsiders” or “vandals.” Its members always deny membership (or are supposed to deny membership) and in checking hundreds of autobiographical listings for members we found only half a dozen who cited an affiliation with Skull & Bones. The rest were silent.An interesting point is whether the many members in various Administrations or who hold government positions have declared their members in the biographical data supplied for FBl ‘background checks\". ·It is a Senior year society which exists only at Yale.Members are chosen in their Junior year and spend only one year on campus,the Senior vear，with Skull & Bones.In other words,the organization is oriented to the post graduate outside world.The Order meets annually - patriarchs only - on Deer Island in the St.Lawrence River. ·Senior societies are unique to Yale.

There are two other seniol societies at Yale,but none elsewhere.Scroll & Key and Wolf’s Head are supposedly competitive societies founded in the mid-19th century.We believe these to be part of the same network.Rosenbaum commented in his Esquire article,very accurately,that anyone in the Eastern Liberal Establishment who is not a member of Skull& Bones is almost certainly a member of either Scroll & Key or Wolf’s Head. What is the significance of the “322” in Chapter 322? William Russell imported the society from Germany and so it has been argued the 322 stands for ‘32 (from 1832)．the second chapter，of this German organization.Possibly a chapter 32O and a chapter 321 may exist somewhere and 323 is the designation of a room within the Skull & Bones temple at Yale. The selection procedure for new members of The Order has not changed since 1832.Each year 15,and only 15,never more,never fewer,are selected.In the past 150 years about 250O Yale graduates have been initiated into The Order.Atany one time about 5OO-600 are alive and active. Roughly about one-quarter of these take an active role in furthering the objectives of The Order.The others either lose interest or change their minds.They are silent drop-outs. A Yale Junior cannot ask to join.There is no electioneering.Juniors are invited to join and are given two options: accept or reject. Apparently some amount of personal information is gathered on potential members. The following is the kind of evaluation made in the last century;we doubt it has changed too much down to the present time: ·“Frank Moore is an ideal Bones man,he is a hard worker and a man whose efforts have been more for Yale than himself.He is manager of the Musical clubs and has been active in Dwight Hall. His election will be well deserved and popular.” “Don Thompson is a sure man whom the class wishes well for and will be glad to see go.He comes from a Bones family. The most likely potential member is from a Bones family，who is energetic,resourceful,political and probably an amoral team player.A man who understands that to get along you have to go along. A man who will sacrifice himself for the good of the team.A moment’s reflection illustrates why this is so.In real life the thrust of The Order is to bring about certain objectives.Honors and financial rewards are guaranteed by the power of The Order.But the price of these honors and rewards is sacrifice to the common goal, the goal of The Order. Some,perhaps many, have not been willing to pay this price. “Immediately on entering Bones the neophyte’s name is changed.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:4:1ed95162c050", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4459, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "A man who will sacrifice himself for the good of the team.A moment’s reflection illustrates why this is so.In real life the thrust of The Order is to bring about certain objectives.Honors and financial rewards are guaranteed by the power of The Order.But the price of these honors and rewards is sacrifice to the common goal, the goal of The Order. Some,perhaps many, have not been willing to pay this price. “Immediately on entering Bones the neophyte’s name is changed. He is no longer known by his name as it appears in the college catalogue but like a monk or Knight of Malta or St. John，becomes Kniqht so and so. The old Knights are then known as Patriarch so and so.The outside world are known as Gentiles and vandals.” The Catalogue (or membership list - it became “Addresses” sometime in this century) of Chapter 322，however,is made with the usual “outside” names and is unique and impressive.Each member has a copy bound in black leather with peculiar symbols on the outside and inside.The symbols presumably have some meaning. The owner’s name and the single letter“D” is gilt-stamped on the outer cover of earlier issues,at least up to the mid-19th century.It then appears to have been omitted,at least on copies we have seen.Each right-hand page，printed one side only，about 6 × 4 inches，has the members listed for one year and surrounded by a heavy black border, thick in the early years,not so thick in recent decades.This symbolizes the death of the person named as he adopts his new name and new life upon entering The Order. Most interesting is an entry between the decade lists of members.On the 1833 list,before the 15 founders’names,are the words “Period 2 Decade 3.” Similarly，before names on the 1843 list are the words “Period 2 Decade 4.” In brief,“Period” stays the same throughout the years,but the“Decade”number increases by one in each ten years.No doubt this means something to The Order,else it wouldn’t be there. Another mystical group of letters and numbers is at the top of the first list of names in 1833,“P.231-D.31.”The numbers increase by one in each succeeding class.In 1834, for example,the entry reads“P.232-D 32.” In fact, out of the first 15 members (actually 14 plus the anonymous member),achievements were not much greater than we would expect from the cream of a Yale “class”.Rufus Hart spent several years in the Ohio Senate, Asahel Hooker Lewis was in the Ohio Legislature for a couple of years,Samuel Marshall was an Illinois State Legislator for a while，and Frederick Mather was in the New York Legislature. Other members,apart from the two founders of The Order,did nothing much with their lives or for The Order. By contrast, the two founding members,William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft, went far. William Russell was a member of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1846-47,a General in the Connecticut National Guard from 1862-70,and founded the Collegiate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:5:9f9987dc6dcd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4460, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "in the Ohio Legislature for a couple of years,Samuel Marshall was an Illinois State Legislator for a while，and Frederick Mather was in the New York Legislature.

William Russell was a member of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1846-47,a General in the Connecticut National Guard from 1862-70,and founded the Collegiate and Commercial Institute in New Haven, Connecticut. Alphonso Taft went further: he was Secretary of War in l876- the first of several members of The Order to hold this post down into the 1950s. Taft became U.S. Attorney General in 1876-7, then U.S.Minister to Austria in 1882-4,and finally U.S.Ambassador to Russia in 1884-5. During the 150-year interval since 1833，active membership has evolved into a core group of perhaps 20-30 families; it seems that active members have enough influence to push their sons and relatives into The Order, and there is significant inter-marriage among the families. These families fall into two major groups. One example is the Lord family.Two branches of this family date from the 1630s: Those descended from Nathan Lord and those from Thomas Lord.Other Lords arrived in the U.S.over the years but do not enter our discussion.Of these two main branches,only the Thomas Lord group appears to have contributed members to The Order.Their ancestry traces to Thomas Lord,who left Essex,England in 1635 in a company led by Rev.Thomas Hooker,and settled in what is now Hartford,Connecticut. In fact,part of Hartford is still known as Lord’s Hil. The line of descent for this Lord family is fullof DeForest and Lockwood names because intermarriage is more than common among these elite families. The first Lord to be initiated into The Order was George DeForest Lord (1854),a New York lawyer.Together with his father,Daniel Lord (another Yale graduate)，George DeForest Lord established the New York law firm of Lord,Day and Lord.Among its present day clients are The New York Times and the Rubin Foundation. The Rubin Foundation is one of the financial angels for the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington,D.C. The openly published literature on The Order amounts to merely two articles over a span of one hundred years: The Iconoclast (Volume One,Number One only) published October 13,1873 and an alreadycited article in Esquire by Ron Rosenbaum，published in 1977.This book and its successors are based on unpublished archival material originating with The Order. Back in October 1873 an enterprising Yale student, stung to action because The Order had taken over Yaie finances and left the University near poverty,took it upon himself to publish an expose.Unfortunately, some of the anonymous student’s acutest observations were buried in not-so-good verse.We will reprint some of the verse below as in the original Iconoclast because it’s impossible to summarize.

The College Press was controlled by The Order. From time to time Yale newspapers were run by Editors in The Order.For example,one noteworthy editor of the Yale Record also in The Order was Thomas Cochran (’94),who went on to make a career as an influential partner in the influential banking firm of J.P. Morgan. “For more than forty years a secret society called Skull and Bones has existed in Yale College. It receives a certain number of men from each class.These are chosen nominally by the members of the class.．., although it is understood that a prominent man’s influence avails for his friends and relatives through several years after his graduation. By observing the men elected from year to year,we find that they are chosen with a distinct end in view,namely，that of obtaining for the society the most honors.Some of these honors are given to literary, some to wealthy men.This，then，is the case.Men receive marks of distinction from Yale College or from their entire class，because of which they are taken into this secret society. Since Yale honors men, this fraternity professes to honor them also. “Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men. They have gone out into the world and have become,in many instances, leaders in society.They have obtained control of Yale.Its business is performed by them.Money paid to the college must pass into their hands,and be subject to their will.No doubt they are worthy men in themselves,but the many whom they looked down upon while in college,cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands. Men in Wall Street complain that the college comes straight to them for help,instead of asking each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale’s and America’s first men: Few will give but Bones men, and they care far more for their society than they do for the college. \"Year by year the deadly evil is growing. The society was never as obnoxious to the college as it is today,and it is just this ili-feeling that shuts the pockets of non-members.Never before has it shown such arrogance and self-fancied superiority.It grasps the College Press and endeavors to rule it all.

To tell the good she might do would be yet more difficult. The question,then,is reduced to this - on the one hand lies a source of incalculable good，- on the other a society guilty of serious and farreaching crimes. It is Yale College against Skull and Bones!! We ask all men,as a question of right,which should be allowed to live?\" “Are not we coming to a sad state when open injustice can be done by the Faculty,and when the fact that a man is a member of Skull and Bones can prejudice them in his favor? Briefly,the case which calls forth this question is this:Two members of the Senior class,the one being a neutral, the other a Bones man,returned at the beginning of the college year laden with several conditions,some of which,upon examination, they failed to pass.Up to this point the cases were parallel,and the leniency，if there was to be leniency，should have been shown to the neutral,who has done all that lay in his power to further the interests of the college、rather than to the Bones man，who has,during his three years at Yale,accomplished nothing that we wot of. But, strange to say, the former has been suspended until the end of the term and obliged to leave town,not being permitted to pass another examination until he returns.The Bones man,on the contrary, is allowed to remain in New Haven,attends recitation daily,is called upon to recite,and will have a second examination in less than six weeks.Why is this distinction made?O,Mr. So-and-so’s is a special case,’ said a professor (a Bones man)，- the specialty,we presume,being the fact that Mr.So-and-so wears a death’s head and cross bones upon his bosom.We understand that Mr. So-and-so claims to have been ill during vacation and offers the illness as an excuse for not passing the examination;but the neutral gentleman was also ill,as the Faculty were expressly informed in a letter from his father.” Only one article is known to have been published within the last 100 years on The Order.Unfortunately,it is a superficial,almost mocking, review and provides some enlightenment but little contribution to historical knowledge. The article is the “Last Secrets of Skull and Bones”by Ron Rosenbaum (Esquire, September 1977).

Among these are:“… the people who have shaped America’s national character since it ceased being an undergraduate power had their undergraduate character shaped in that crypt over there” (i.e.,the“temple”on the Yale campus). And when Rosenbaum starts to inquire about The Order, he is told: “They don’t like people tampering and prying. The power of Bones is incredible. They’ve got their hands on every lever of power in the country. You’ll see - it’s like trying to look into the Mafia.Remember they’re a secret society too.” This author does,however,possess copies of the “Addresses”books, which used to be called “Catalogues.”These are the membership lists all the way back to 1832, the founding date in the United States.How did this material make its way into outside hands? It is possible that one or more members,although bound by oath,would not be dismayed if the story became public knowledge. That’s all we will say. ·Most members are from the Eastern seaboard United States. As late as 1950 only three members resided in Los Angeles, California,but 28 members resided in New Haven,Connecticut. ·Members are all males and almost all WASPS (White Anglo Saxon Protestant). In great part they descended from English Puritan families,their ancestors arrived in North America in the 1630-1660 period. These Puritan families either intermarried with financial power orinvited in sons of money moguls，e.g..Rockefellers, Davisons,and Harrimans.whose sons became members of The Order. A key family is the Whitneys,descended from English Puritans who came to the U.S.about 1635 and settled in Watertown，Mass.Eight Whitneys have been members of The Order. Of these.three had brief lives; Emerson Cogswell Whitney died a few months after initiation and Edward Payson Whitney “disappeared in 1858” according to his biographer.However, three Whitneys,William Collins Whitney and his two sons,are the core of Whitney influence in The Order which survives today through the Harriman family and intermarriage with Paynes and Vanderbilts.

Willim C.Whitney married Flora Payne,daughter of Standard Oil Treasurer Oliver Payne.The Paynes are not in The Order, but adding the Payne piece of the Standard Oil fortune made Whitney’s fortune that much larger. Their two sons,Harry Payne (’94) and Payne Whitney (’98), went to Yale and became members of The Order. After Yale Harry Payne promptly married Gertrude Vanderbilt in 1896 and so the Whitney-Payne fortune now joined some Vanderbilt money. This financial power was channeled into Guaranty Trust， the J.P. Morgan and Guggenheim outfits. And it gets more complicated.For example,the son of Harry Payne Whitney,Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney，married Marie Norton.After their divorce,Marie Norton Whitney married W.Averell Harriman (his first wife) who is today at 91 a key member. It is these tightly woven family and financial interlocks that make up the core of The Order. This American was not the President, nor the Vice-President, nor the Secretary of State,nor any member of the Reagan Administration. It was a private individual - W. Averell Harriman. The first time any American had talked with Yuri Andropov since the death of his predecessor,Brezhnev.So who is W.Averell Harriman? The elder Harriman,a prominent and not too scrupulous railroad magnate，sent both his sons to Yale. William Averell Harriman (’13) and Edward Roland Noel Harriman (’17) joined The Order.A good example of how old line families in The Order absorbed new wealth families,although as history has unfolded it may be that Harriman and his fellow investment bankers have dominated the direction of The Order in the past few decades.

By the 197Os the relatively unknown private international banking firm of Brown Brothers,Harriman,with assets of about one-half billion dollars,had taken in so many of “the Brotherhood” that out of 26 individual partners,no fewer than 9 were members of The Order. We don’t know of any greater concentration of members. Outside already,in the doubtful dawn, Thither,from this side and from that, slow sweep, And settle down in silence solidly, Crow-wise，the frightful Brotherhood of Death. Black-hatted and black-hooded huddle they, With black cravats a-dangling from each neck; So take they their grim station at the door, Torches lit, skull-and-cross-bones-banner spread. We are concerned here only with the core of a purely American phenomenon with German origin. It is undoubtedly linked to overseas groups. The links between The Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers.Notably the British establishment was also founded at a University - Oxford University，and especially All Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called “The Group.” The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes “inner circle”). The Order in the U.S. links to the Guggenheim，Schiff and Warburg families. There were no Jews at all in The Order until very recently. In fact, The Order has,as Rosenbaum suggests,some definite anti-semetic tendencies. Token Jews (and token blacks) have been admitted in recent years. All these groups have cooperative and competitive features.But to argue that all the world’s ils can be ascribed to any one of these groups is false.The core of The Order， like the core of “The Group”in England,comprises about 20 families.In the U.S.case they are mostly descendents from the original settlers in Massachusetts. New wealth did not enter The Order until the mid-19th century and until recently,has never dominated The Order.On the other hand，key families，the Whitneys and the Harrimans,are linked to their own banking interests. In many ways these old line Yankee families have outsmarted the bankers. The Puritans diverted bankers’ wealth to their own objectives without always absorbing the banker families.The Order controls the substantial wealth of Andrew Carnegie,but no Carnegie has ever been a member of The Order.The Order used the Ford wealth so flagrantly against the wishes of the Ford family that two Fords resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation. No Ford has been a member of The Order. The name Morgan has never appeared on the membership lists, although some Morgan partners are with the inner core, for example, Davison", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:11:0ef41dfe5375", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4466, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "without always absorbing the banker families.The Order controls the substantial wealth of Andrew Carnegie,but no Carnegie has ever been a member of The Order.The Order used the Ford wealth so flagrantly against the wishes of the Ford family that two Fords resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation. No Ford has been a member of The Order. The name Morgan has never appeared on the membership lists, although some Morgan partners are with the inner core, for example, Davison and Perkins.Interestingly，the Astor name is prominent in “The Group” in England, but not in The Order in the U.S. The Order has either set up or penetrated just about every significant research,policy,and opinion-making organization in the United States. in addition to the Church,business, law. government and politics. Not all at the same time，but persistently and consistently enough to dominate the direction of American society. The evolution of American society is not, and has not been for a century、a voluntary development reflecting individual opinion. ideas and decisions at the grass roots. On the contrary，the broad direction has been created artificially and stimulated by The Order. “there is …an inner core of intimate associates who unquestionably knew that they were members of a group devoted to a common purpose and an outer circle of a iarger number on whom the inner circle acted by personal persuasion, patronage distribution and social pressure.It is probable that most members of the outer circle were not conscious that they were being used by a secret society.” Among academic associations the American Historical Association. the American Economic Association，the American Chemical Society, and the American Psychological Association were all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order. These are key associations for the conditioning of society. This phenomenon of The Order as the FIRST on the scene is found especially among foundations.although it appears that The Order keeps a continuing presence among Foundation Trustees. It does more than just be FlRST where money is concerned. It stays around to keep an eye on expenditures. The FIRST President of the Carnegie Institution (1902-5) was Daniel Coit Gilman,but other members of The Order have been on Carnegie boards since the turn of the century.Gilman was on the scene for the founding of the Peabody，Slater.and Russell Saqe Foundations.McGeorge Bundy was President of the Ford Foundation from 1966-1979. The FIRST Chairman of an influential but almost unknown organization established in 191O was also a member of The Order.In 1920 Theodore Marburg founded the American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes,but Marburg was only President. The FIRST Chairman was member William Howard Taft (78). The Society was the forerunner of the League to Enforce the Peace，which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately into the United Nations.

A key penetration is the Union Theological Seminary,afiliated with Columbia University in New York. This Seminary, a past subject of investigation for Communist infiltration，has close links to The Order. Henry Sloane Coffin (’97) was Professor of Practical Theology at Union from 1904 to 1926 and President of Union Theological Seminary，also known as the “Red Seminary,” from 1926 to 1945.Union has such a wide interpretation of religious activity that has，or used to have，an Atheists Club for its students. ·Henry Luce of Time-Life is in The Order. ·so is William Buckley (5O) of National Review and Alfred Cowles (’13), President of Cowles Communications, Des Moines Register.Minneapolis Star ·and Emmert Bates (’32) of Liton Educational Systems. plus ·Richard Ely Danielson （’O7) of Atlantic Monthly ·Russell Wheeler Davenport (’23), Fortune ·John Chipman Farrar (’18)，of Farrar,Straus, the publishers. The oil companies have their links to The Order. Members Percy Rockefeller， the Paynes,the Pratts.all link to Standard Oil. Shell Oil, Creole Petroleum，and Socony Vacuum also link.A wide variety of manufacturing firms have members in The Order from the Donnelley family in Chicago (printers of the Oficial Airline Guide and other references): lumber companies like Weyerhaeuser， who is also a Trilateralist: Dresser Industries, and so on. A dozen members can be linked to the Federal Reserve, but one appointment is noteworthy,Pierre Jay (92),whose only claim to fame in 1913 was to run a private school and be an obscure Vice President of Manhattan Bank yet he became FIRST Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve,the really significant Reserve Bank. In 1981 The Anglo American Establishment.by Carroll Quigley,was published in New York by a small anti-Establishment publisher.Quigley was formerly instructor at Princeton and Harvard and then Professor at the School of Foreign Service，Georgetown University. The publisher notes in his introduction that Quigley had been unable to find a major publisher for the manuscript. This is not surprising. The book blows the lid off the British equivalent of The Order.

The publisher probably inserted the word AMERlCAN\" into the title to enhance marketability in the States. Quigley describes in minute detail the historical operations of the British establishment controlled by a secret society and operating very much as The Order operates in the U.S. This is the real significance of Quigley’s explosive book. The British secret society. known as“The Group” or just plain “US”, was founded at Oxford University.much as The Order was founded at Yale．but without the Masonic mumbo jumbo. As we noted in Memorandum Five.the Group operates in a series of concentric circles and like The Order consists of old line families allied with private merchant bankers.known in the U.S.as investment bankers. Bearing in mind.the proven existence of The Group.the operations of The Order and the kind of penetration it has achieved cannot be explained by mere chance.By examining The Order’s operations we can generate a picture of its objectives without access to any internal constitution or statement of objectives even if such exists. It may only be word of mouth. \"The extension of British rule throughout the world.the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are at-tainable by energy.labour and enterprise .. .and the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire. Both The Group and The Order have been created by Anglophiles who want to pattern the world on a Hegelian-Anglo hybrid culture. Where the Latins,the Slavs and the Sino races fit is not considered, but clearly these cultures will be disinclined to become pawns of either the British Empire or New England Yankees.Even within the Commonwealth，a voluntary association of nations，it is unlikely that Canada,Australia and New Zealand would accept the constitutional bondage envisaged by Cecil Rhodes.Both secret organizations overlook,and there is a philosophic basis for this neglect，the natural right of any ethnic group,be it white,black or yellow,English, Slavic or Latin,to develop its own culture without coercion. Unlike this author,Quigley sympathizes with the ends of The Group, although he terms their methods despicable.Both The Group and The Order are unwilling or unable to bring about a global society by voluntary means，so they opted for coercion.To do this they have created wars and revolutions, they have ransacked public treasuries,they have oppressed，they have pillaged，they have lied ~ even to their own countrymen. Now if,for example,we found that the dominant interest of members was raising ducks,that they wrote articles about", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:14:6bad8ce0bc18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4469, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "Unlike this author,Quigley sympathizes with the ends of The Group, although he terms their methods despicable.Both The Group and The Order are unwilling or unable to bring about a global society by voluntary means，so they opted for coercion.To do this they have created wars and revolutions, they have ransacked public treasuries,they have oppressed，they have pillaged，they have lied ~ even to their own countrymen. Now if,for example,we found that the dominant interest of members was raising ducks,that they wrote articles about ducks,bred ducks,sold ducks，formed duck-studying councils，developed a philosophy of ducks, then it would be reasonable to conclude that they had an objective concerning ducks, that this is not mere random activity. Historically,operations of The Order have concentrated on society, how to change society in a specific manner towards a specific goal: a New World Order. We know the elements in society that will have to be changed in order to bring about this New World order,we can then examine The Order’s actions in this context. Politics - the direction of the State, Economy - the creation of wealth, History - what people believe happened in the past, Psychology - the means of controlling how people think, Philanthropy - so that people think well of the controllers. Medicine - the power over health, life and death, Religion - people’s spiritual beliefs,the spur to action for many, Media - what people know and learn about current events, Continuity - the power to appoint who follows in your Operations in each of these areas will be detailed in subsequent volumes.For example,in the next volume, The Order Controls Education，we will describe how Daniel Coit Gilman，President of Johns Hopkins University,imported Wundt psychological methods from Germany，then welded education and psychology in the U.S.,established laboratories,brought these educational laboratories into major Universities and generated 1OOs of PhDs to teach the new educational conditioning system.One of the first of these Johns Hopkins doctorates was John Dewey. The result we well know.The educational morass of the ‘80s where most kids - not all - can’t spell, read or write,yet can be programmed into mass behaviour channeis. The Order’s next move was to control the Foundations. They got all the big ones - Carnegie，Ford,Peabody，Slater，Russell Sage and so on.That’s the topic of another volume.As in education,the modus operandi of The Order was to get in FIRST and set the stage for the future. The initial objective was to establish a direction in an organization.Selection of managers,intuitive or amoral enough to catch on to the direction，kept the momentum going. In the case of Foundations. The Order has usually maintained a continuing presence over decades. ·Andrew Carnegie profited from war through his vast steel holdings,but under the guidance of member Daniel Coit Gilman，Carnegie was also an enthusiastic president and financial backer of the American Peace Society.This is seeminqly inconsistent.

Could Carnegie be for war and peace at the same time? · The League to Enforce the Peace， founded by members William H. Taft and Theodore Marburg,was promoting peace, yet active in urging U.S.participation in World War One.How could the League be for war and peace at the same time? · In the 192Os,W. Averell Harriman was a prime supporter of the Soviets with finance and diplomatic assistance,at a time when such aid was against State Department regulations.Harriman participated in RUSKOMBANK，the first Soviet commercial bank.Vice-President Max May of Guaranty Trust,dominated by the Harriman-Morgan interests，became the FIRST Vice-President of RUSKOMBANK in charge of its foreign operations. In brief,an American banker under guidance of a member of The Order had a key post in a Soviet bank! But we also find that Averell Harriman,his brother Roland Harriman,and members E.S.James and Knight Woolley，through the Union Bank (in which they held a major interest) were prime financial backers of Hitler. · The Bundy family (we have a Memorandum on them later) qives us another example of seeming inconsistency.William Bundy was with the Central Intelligence Agency for a decade. McGeorge Bundy was National Security Assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. So the Bundys presumably support U.S.-European policy which is pro-NATO. Yet the Bundys have been linked to activities and organizations which are anti-NATO and,indeed,pro-Marxist - for example,the Institute for Policy Studies.Are the Bundys inconsistent? Among individual members of The Order we find a wide variety of publically proclaimed beliefs,ideologies and politics.William Buckely periodically chews out the Soviets.On the other hand, member John Burtt has been a member of a dozen communist front groups.Member William S.Coffin，Jr.spent three years with CIA and then became a leader of anti-Vietnam war activity through the National Conference for a New Politics and Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam.In fact, Cofin was one of the Boston Five charged and indicted for conspiracy to violate Federal laws.And，of course，W.Averell Harriman is elder statesman of the Democratic Party. Probably the most difficult task in this work willbe to get across to the reader what is really an elementary observation:that the objective of The Order is neither “left’nor”right.”“Left” and “right”are artificial devices to bring about change，and the extremes of political left and political right are vital elements in a process of controled change. The answer to this seeming political puzzle lies in Hegelian logic. Remember that both Marx and Hitler,the extremes of “leftand “right” presented as textbook enemies,evolved out of the same philosophical system:Hegelianism.That brings screams of intellectual anguish from Marxists", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:16:9a5fb9bf8808", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4471, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "to the reader what is really an elementary observation:that the objective of The Order is neither “left’nor”right.”“Left” and “right”are artificial devices to bring about change，and the extremes of political left and political right are vital elements in a process of controled change. The answer to this seeming political puzzle lies in Hegelian logic. Remember that both Marx and Hitler,the extremes of “leftand “right” presented as textbook enemies,evolved out of the same philosophical system:Hegelianism.That brings screams of intellectual anguish from Marxists and Nazis, but is well known to any student of political systems. The dialectical process did not originate with Marx as Marxists claim, but with Fichte and Hegel in late 18th and early 19th century Germany. In the dialectical process a clash of opposites brings about a synthesis. For example,a clash of political left and political right brings about another political system，a synthesis of the two，neither left nor right. This conflict of opposites is essential to bring about change. Today this process can be identified in the literature of the Trilateral Commission where “change” is promoted and “conflict management” is termed the means to bring about this change. In the Hegelian system conflict is essential. Furthermore,for Hegel and systems based on Hegel, the State is absolute.The State requires complete obedience from the individual citizen.An individual does not exist for himself in these so-called organic systems but only to perform a role in the operation of the State.He finds freedom only in obedience to the State. There was no freedom in Hitler’s Germany, there is no freedom for the individual under Marxism,neither will there be in the New World Order. And if it sounds like George Orwell’s 1984 - it is. So who or what is the State? Obviously it’s a self-appointed elite. It is interesting that Fichte,who developed these ideas before Hegel, was a freemason,almost certainly Illuminati,and certainly was promoted by the Illuminati. For example,Johann Wolfgang Goethe (Abaris in the Illuminati code) pushed Fichte for an appointment at Jena University. This,then,is a vital part of our explanation of The Order.When its co-founder,William Russell,was in Germany in 1831-2, there was no way he could have avoided Hegelian theory and discussion.It was the talk of the campus.It swept intellectual Germany like a Pac Man craze. Most Americans haven’t heard of it. And those who have don’t want to hear any more about it.Why? Because its assumptions are completely at variance with our sense of individual freedom and Constitutional guarantees. Most of us believe the State exists to serve the individual, not vice versa. The Order believes the opposite to most of us. That is crucial to understanding what they are about. So any dicsussion between left and right,while essential to promote change,is never allowed to develop into a discussion along the lines of Jeffersonian democracy,i.e.,the best government is least government.

The discussion and the funding is always towards more state power,use of state power and away from individual rights. So it doesn’t matter from the viewpoint of The Order whether it is termed left,right，Democratic,Republican，secular or religious - so long as the discussion is kept within the framework of the State and the power of the State. This is the common feature between the seemingly dissimilar posi-tions taken by members - they have a higher common objective in which clash of ideas is essential. So long as rights of the individual are not introduced into the discussion the clash of ideas generates the conflict necessary for change. As the objective is also global control an emphasis is placed on global thinking,i.e.，internationalism．This is done through world organizations and world law. The great contribution of the Tafts to The Order was on the world court system and world law - to the internationalist aspect of the New World Order. Organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) do not fit the requirements for a conspiracy.They are simply too large and their membership is not secret.The membership list for The Order has never surfaced until now.Anyone can obtain a list of members for the CFR and the Trilateral Commission.Also,too many people are included as members in these organizations who are just not given to membership in conspiratorial groups. Moreover， the CFR and its sister organizations are not geared to ac-tion and implementation of policy. Compare, for example,the Brown Brothers,Harriman firm with nine members of The Order and the CFR. Obviously the first is more cohesive,yet more low profile,more able to conceal its actions，yet more action oriented. The larger open orqanizations are a forum for discussion，a place where ideas can be kicked around,“a rich man’s club”,as someone commented,where people can be assessed,where discrete comment and criticism can be made away from a nosy press and a possibly unsympathetic public.

(3) The inner core,a secret society within a secret society.This is the inner decision-making core.We cannot prove it exists,but logic suggests that some members of the inner circle will form an executive committee,an action group，an inner core.While we cannot prove the existence of an inner core,there are some ob-vious candidates for memberhsip and we could hazard a guess as to the identity of the Chairman. The Council on Foreign Relations is the largest organizaiton in the outer circle. It has about 250O members at any one time,as many as The Order in its entire history. The Trilateral Commisson has 200 members world wide，but only 70 in the United States.These are younger organizations.The CFR dates from 1922,The Pilgrims from 1900，The Trilateral Commission from 1973，and the Bilderbergers from the 1950s. The make-up of the Council on Foreign Relations reflects its purpose as a meeting ground,a discussion forum.The CFR mainly consists of government officials,industrialists and academics.The Order has a distinctly different make-up,i.e.,many more lawyers,for example,and a wider variety of declared occupations with far fewer industrialists. The Trilateral Commission was founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller and comprises 20O members world wide，of whom about 77 are American. There is no overlap among memberships; for example,lumber industrialist Frederick Weyerhaeuser was in The Order,but his son is in the Trilateral Commission and not The Order.Similarly, Robert Taft, Jr., is in the Trilateral Commission but not The Order,even though The Order was co-founded by his great grandfather and eight Tafts have been members. The link is elusive,conceivably there may not be a link. The Trilateral Commission is not a conspiracy. Its membership list is completely public - it costs a postage stamp to get one.The Commission publishes dozens of booklets.The organization is completely above ground. In fact,this author has openly debated with George Franklin, Jr.,Coordinator of the Trilateral Commission on the radio.Mr.Franklin did show a rather illconcealed dislike for the assault on his pet global New World Order - and made the mistake of attempting to disguise this objective, but evasion and hostility do not constitute conspiracy. Conspirators just don’t appear on radio talk shows to debate their objectives.

It may be a vehicle to attain an interim goal, i.e., three regional groupings.In this case J. Richardson Dilworth is the conduit and liaison. The circumstances that surround the founding of Scroll & Key in the 1850s suggest this secret society may in fact be Chapter 323.But this is pure speculation. So we have two secret societies that differ extensively from the CFR,Trilaterals and others and which can be seen as making up an inner circle. Even this inner circle is too large for decision making.No doubt it includes many active or just plain bored members,even many who have forgotten they were ever initiated and who might be shocked to read in this book that they belong to a subversive organization.So logically there is a secret society within the secret society.Again，we cannot prove it, but it’s a logical deduction. This would be an executive committee that controls finances and makes basic decisions. Another important distinction between the outer core and the inner circle is in funding.This is important because funding controls evervthing. The families in The Order are closer to more foundations and more sources of funding than the Rockefeller family.To be sure, the Rockefeller family has 1 percent of Chase Manhattan stock,enough for control.and it has influence in the Rockefeller Foundation,but this doesn’t compare to the centuries long pervasive influence of The Order. Remember，it was The Order that got John D.Rockefeller off the ground with his General Education Board,not the other way round. Many of these old line families see the Rockefellers as upstarts,as nouveau riche，not quite on the outside looking in，but definitely not socially acceptable without some reservations - except for their money，of course. Anyone who heard Nelson Rockefeller speak and compared his syntax to the polished charm of a Boston Brahmin will understand.There’s a New England saying that “the Lowells only talk to the Cabots and the Cabots only talk to God.”The Rockefellers just are not in this league. Members of The Order are to be found in every segment of society: in education,in foundations,in politics,in government,industry. law and finance.Consequently,at any time The Order can tap influence in any area ofsociety.The occupational breakdown of The Order demonstrates the great breadth of this horizontal chain of influence.The major occupations of members are law，education，business，finance and industry.

Notably the areas of society least represented are those with the least ability to influence the structural direction of society. They may give depth and richness to society,but are not essential to its control and direction.For example，very，very few engineers have ever been members of The Order - we only identified five engieners in the 150 year span.Yet engineering and technology are key elements to the success of the material aspects of American society.Art,architecture,and music are under-represented.We can only identify 16 members in these three occupations over 150 years.Again,these occupations are not influential in determining the structure of society.Farmers are under-represented; only 16 in 150 years,but we suspect some took up farming to get away from The Order. The practice of absolute preferment for members of The Order has worked to perpetuate its influence over time in a remarkable manner. Before we look at this chain of influence we need to look at some basic statistics.The Order has only initiated about 25O0 members in its history in the United States.Each year 15 new members are initiated,no more, no less. On the other hand,between 800,000 and 1 million persons receive college degrees each year from an institute of higher learning, including about 30,O00 doctorates. When you follow the chain of influence below,hold in mind that out of 30-40 million degree holders,a few hundred men (never women) or in this case less than a dozen men,are presumed to be the only ones fit to occupty top posts in government. No one else is even seriously considered.We are asked to believe that only a few hundred members of The Order are capable of guiding the United States. If we assume a random distribution of ability throughout the United States, then our evidence cannot be accounted for by chance.It must reflect,just on the basis of mathematical laws of average,a conscious series of choices.Unless you want to assume that all wisdom and all ability in the United States is generated solely by 15 Yale graduates each year.And that gets you back to the argument of this book. Four families provide an example of one such chain of influence. Multiply this chain by a few dozen and you readily see how control is perpetuated by a small group. The families in this chain are Whitney, Stimson,Acheson and Bundy.The Acheson family is only partly in The Order.Dean Acheson was a member of Scroil & Key at Yale.This is an offshoot of The Order and at least influenced by it.Dean Acheson’s daughter，Mary Acheson，married William Bundy (The Order).Dean Acheson’s son,David,is a member of The Order.

(1）We start with the Whitneys in the late 19th century. Whitney (The Order),along with Ryan and a handful of other capitalists,have been heavily criticized in several books on grounds of massive corruption and fraud. New York street railway franchises generated enormous profits for the Whitney group. When Whitney was Secretary of the Navy he promoted a giant naval ship building program - which didn’t hurt his friends who owned shipyards and steel mills. (2) In 1890 along comes young Henry Stimson,fresh out of Yale, The Order,and Harvard Law School. Stimson joins Root’s law firm (“B”)，then called Root & Clark．After a while，in 1897，it became known as Root, Howard,Winthrop & Stimson and by 1901 it became Winthrop and Stimson. In the meantime (“C”), Stimson married Mabel White,daughter of Charles A.White (The Order). · As Secretary of War Stimson completed a reorganization begun by his predecessor none other than Elihu Root. ·From 1917 to 1922 Stimson was in the Army,with ranks up to Brigadier General. · In 1927 Coolidge appointed Stimson Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. ·In 1929 Herbert Hoover appointed Stimson Secretary of State (Point “E” on the chart). (4) While Stimson was still Secretary of War he brought Harvey Hollister’s son，McGeorge Bundy (The Order)，into the Pentagon to work on a book manuscript (“H” on the chart).This was published in 1948,entitled On Active Service In Peace And War. The joint authorship (see illustration) gave McGeorge Bundy a quick start in his career, as we shall describe in the next Memorandum when we pick up the career of the two younger Bundys,both members of The Order. The Order does not just go to college, look for a secure post with an establishment law firm,intermarry with the sisters and daughters of other members，get noisily drunk at the country club and go to church on Sunday. These may be reasonably “normal” patterns, but certainly not topics for research and analysis.

We can safely ignore Fred:his qreat achievement in life was Chairman of the North Atlantic Fillet Council which sounds vaguely like a government policy organization,but is concerned merely with marketing fish fillets.If the other Bundys had followed in Fred’s honest,industrious footsteps and confined their activism to fish fillets,the world would be a lot safer, saner place. Born Grand Rapids,Michigan 1888,died 1963. His grandfather was a lawyer and Congressman,and his father was a lawyer too. Harvey Hollister described himself as lawyer and government official. Bundy was initiated into The Order in 19O9.After a Harvard law degree and some world travel he became law clerk to Supreme Court Associate Justice Wendell Holmes (1914-1915).By coincidence, Alger Hiss, later convicted of perjury in the celebrated Chambers-Hiss trials involving Soviet espionage,was also a law clerk to Justice Holmes (1929-1930). The next eldest is William Putnam Bundy,initiated in 1939.The next son is McGeorge Bundy,initiated in 194O.The eldest daughter, Harriet Lowell Bundy,married Gasper d’Andelot Belin, a partner in Covington and Burling and initiated with William Bundy in i939.The youngest daughter, Katherine Lawrence Bundy,married Hugh Auchincloss,Jr. ·1947-1951 Law firm Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. · 1951-1961 Central Intelligence Agency ·1960 Staff Director of Presidential Commission on National Goals ·1961-3 Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs ·1964-9 Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Vietnam War period. ·1969-71 Visiting Professor at Center for International Studies，MIT ·1972 Editor of Foreign Affairs,the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) quarterly and the most prestigious foreign affairs journal in the U.S. A guide for all policy makers.Winston Lord (The Order) is Chairman of CFR. Burling is intimately linked to Government regulatory affairs，it’s reasonable to presume that Bundy probably had CIA dealings in the 1947-51 period and then moved to CIA to expand on these projects. The firm of Covington & Burling represents more than 100 top U.S. firms in Washington. Former partners have included Wiliam Bundy’s father-in-law,Dean Acheson,and brother-in-law，Gasper Belin,(The Order). An interesting aspect of this law firm,where the Bundy family consists of the single most influential element in the past few decades, is its creation of “left wing” political activity. This creative activity brings to mind the McCarthy Senate hearings on subversion of the 1953 era when Senator Joseph McCarthy wanted to call William Bundy as a witness before the Committee and found the establishment strongly arrayed against this idea (Bundy had given $400 to the Alger Hiss Defense Fund).

In retrospect it may have been more than McCarthy’s harsh treatment of witnesses - which is on the record - that prompted establishment horror. There may indeed have been some skeletons in the closet (and perhaps some bones) that the Senator could have unwitingly unearthed， and these skeletons had nothing to do with domestic communism. · Covington & Burling partner John Douglas is the son of Paul H. Douglas - who was one of the most prominent radicals of the 30s and 40s and an outspoken member of the non-communist left. John Douglas was a key coordinator in the 1972 George McGovern campaign: McGovern，of course.being on the left end of the political spectrum. ·Another former partner is Senator Charles Mathias，whose political stance is more or less at the left end of the Republican Party and along the lines of George Bush’s (The Order) internationalist line · Yet another partner is Michael Boudin,son of Leonard Boudin and brother of Kathy Boudin. This should raise some eyebrows as Kathy was on the FBl “Most Wanted” list. Leonard Boudin is the long time communist front lawyer and member of the Na-tional Lawyers Guild (“The foremost legal bulwark of the Communist Party”). New Masses (“a communist periodical”) and a dozen other Communist fronts.Kathy was a founder of Students for a Democratic Society and a leader in its terrorist Weathermen faction.A bomb manufacturing enterprise got the group into trouble with the law and Kathy onto the FBI list. In brief,we have the elements of a hypothesis that left wing activity in the U.S.，down to bomb making and outright terrorism，may link to Covington and Burling - and the ClA.This is not a new assertion. Statements have been made before that the CIA has funded the left in the U.S.This claim hasn’t received too much publicity for two reasons: (a) it offends the establishment media,which prefers to pose the ClA as a “right” organization and (b) it doesn’t make much sense. It certainly doesn’t make any sense unless you throw your mind back to Memorandum Number Six and the Hegelian dialectic process.In this process change requires conflict,and conflict requires the clash of opposites.You can’t just have a “right,”you must have a“right” and a “left.” You can’t have just a pro-Vietnam War policy， you must also have an anti-Vietnam War policy.Else the dialectical process won’t bring about change.An interesting thought.

If you have goals,you logically need a device to achieve these goals. In a society like the U.S.it should bea superfluous sort of commission unless there is some “guiding hand,” something more than the voting booth and the market place at work. (a) “a role of government is to stimulate changes of attitude” (b) “in the 196Os every American is summoned to extraordinary personal responsibility，sustained effort,and sacrifice” (c) “The American citizen in the years ahead ought to devote a larger portion of his time and energy directly to solution of the nation’s problems…many ways are open for citizens to participate in the attainment of national goals.” Now the basic set of rules governing our society is the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.There is nothing in these constitutional documents to support any of these demands.What the demands imply is that an American citizen has a DUTY to advance the will of the State. But such an assumption is definitely NOT implicit in the philosophy under which the United States was founded and presumably operates today. · The Hegelian tinge、that a citizen has a duty to the State, · The operation of the Hegelian dialectic and whether any “left” operations can be traced more directly to Covington and Burling, · Whether Bundy’s service in Government shows promotion of “right”operations,needed to balance offthe“left”operations. If there is one job in this world that requires experience,it must be a staff planning officer for an amphibious operation.Only experience can make the calculations of timing and logistics for personnel and supplies come out right.And men’s lives depend on this experience.Can a 23-year-old,with no military experience,undertake planning for amphibious operations? The answer is obviously no even if his father (The Order) is in the Pentagon as an aide to the Secretary of War (The Order). Then，in quick succession，Bundy became consultant to the Economic Cooperation Administration，although he presumably knew no more about economics than amphibious landing,then foreign policy analyst for Presidential candidate Thomas Dewey, then analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations.By 1949 Bundy was invited to Harvard University and in four years (1953) was made Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. We are asked to believe that out of hundreds,perhaps thousands,of experienced academics with decades of hard-won credentials,an assistant professor’who has been skipping around the non-academic world for ten vears is the most talented for the post of Harvard Dean!

From 1961 to 1966 Bundy was Special Assistant for National Security Affairs to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.There is a significant aspect of this sensitive post which only surfaced under Henry Kissinger. The post can be used to screen information reaching the President: in fact, that is one of its major purposes, to stop a flood of paper reaching the Presidential desk. McGeorge Bundy was National Security Adviser in the early years of the Vietnam debacle.While McGeorge Bundy (The Order) was in the White House his brother，William P. ·Bundy (The Order) was in key positions relating to the Far East in Defense and State Departments. By acting jointly,the Bundy brothers could have controlled absolutely the flow of information relating to Vietnam from Inteligence，State and DOD.We are not saying this happened.We believe it to be a hypothesis worthy of examination.As they are blood brothers in a secret organization of which we know very little - and nothing voluntarily – we have reason to make this further examination. .. in the oid scheme of things I would not have qualifications to be a professor - I have no PhD degree,no scholarly research publications to my credit. I once applied to the Yale Graduate School but was turned down as academically unpromising.\" (Apparently The Order doesn’t reach everywhere,even at Yale). From time to time their plans go awry.The bubbling pot of political manipulation - it’s called conflict management on the inside - threatens to spill over into public view.It is extraordinary how newspaper editors，columnists，TV and radio commentators，and publishers either lack insight to see beyond the superficial or are scared witless to do so. Even worse,the educated public,the 30-4O million degree holders, lets these opinion molders get away with it. It may be said,with great restraint,that,never since the Dark and Middle Ages,have there been so many powerful forces organized and alerted against the assertion and acceptance of historical truth asare active today to prevent the facts about the responsibility for the second World War and its results from being made generally accessible to the American public.Even the great Rockefeller Foundation frankly admits (Annual Report,1946,p.188) the subsidizing of a corps of historians to anticipate and frustrate the development of any neo-Revisionism in our time.And the only difference between this Foundation and several others is that it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:26:9484b3980e5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4481, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "many powerful forces organized and alerted against the assertion and acceptance of historical truth asare active today to prevent the facts about the responsibility for the second World War and its results from being made generally accessible to the American public.Even the great Rockefeller Foundation frankly admits (Annual Report,1946,p.188) the subsidizing of a corps of historians to anticipate and frustrate the development of any neo-Revisionism in our time.And the only difference between this Foundation and several others is that it has been more candid and forthright about its politics. This author’s personal experience of attempted outright censorship was at the Hoover Institution,Stanford University,when the Director attempted to suppress publication of my then forthcoming National Suicide:Military Aid To The Soviet Union. The facts weren’t in question.Unfortunately,the book offended the Nixon-Kissinger program to aid the Soviets while they were aiding the North Vietnamese - so in effect，Americans were being killed by our own technology.In this case neither author nor publisher was in a mood to listen,and the Establishment put tail between legs and called it a day. The “left” leaning segment of the press can always be relied upon to autmatically assault ideas and information from the “right” and vice versa.In fact,media outlets have been artificially set up just for this purpose: both Nation and New Republic on the “left”were financed by Willard Straight,using Payne Whitney (The Order) funds.On the “riqht” National Review published by William Buckley (The Order) runs a perpetual deficit,presumably made up by Buckley. All the power in the world is useless without accurate information. If you meet these people,as this author has more or less casually over 30 years，one impression comes to the forefront – they are charming but with a limited perception of the world. They may have global ambitions, they may act politically like miniature power houses,but their knowledge of the world comes from an in-group and those who play along with the in-group.And the in-group lacks morality and diversity. It’s a kind of jet Set Politburo.Charming，power-hungry and myopic simultaneously. All it can offer to the outsider is an invitation,almost an ultimatum, “You are part of the establishment.”Which has as much interest for many as a Frederick Bundy fish fillet.Perhaps one of the exceptions is house conservative William Buckley，Jr. - at least his cynicism is marked by witty incisiveness.The rest are a pretty sad bunch.

The movement that will topple The Order will be extremely simple and most effective.It will be ten thousand or a million Americans who come to the conclusion that they don’t want the State to be boss, that they prefer to live under the protection of the Constitution. They will make their own independent decision to thwart The Order,and it will take ten thousand or a million forms. In the first introductory volume we have laid out the preliminary groundwork and suggested some hypotheses we need to examine.An understanding of The Order，the havoc it has wreaked on American society, its plans for future havoc - perpetual war for perpetual peace - is a logical step by step process. The next step is to look at education. Our present educational chaos can be traced to three members of The Order: Daniel Coit Gilman (First President of University of California and First President of Johns Hopkins University),Timothy Dwight (twelfth President of Yale Univer-sity)and Andrew Dickson White (First President of Cornell University). Gilmanimportedthe experimentalpsychology ofHegelian physiologist Wilhelm Wundt from Germany. This psychology was grafted onto the American education system through the educational laboratories at Columbia and Chicago University. And they moved a familiar name, John Dewey,a pure Hegelian in philosophy,along the fast track in his carerr.This has been aptly termed“The Leipzig Connec-tion”by Lance J. Klass and Paolo Lionni. Then we shall look at the Foundations,how these were captured by The Order and their gigantic funds used to finance a Hegelian educational system designed to condition future society. It is doubtful if John D. Rockefeller or Mrs.Russell Sage,and certainly the Ford family, ever quite understood how their philanthropies were used for a long-term conditioning plan. It is also doubtfrul if The Order forecast the public backlash of the 1970s and 1980s - not all children have succumbed to the social conditioning brainwashing， parents have more than once risen in part revolt,private schools have sprouted like spring flowers in the desert and perhaps enough academics have slipped through a net designed to contain and neutralize independent research and thinking. After we have looked at education and foundations we still have to work our way through the system of “perpetual war for perpetual peace.” How The Order has financed revolution and profited from war.

The objective? To keep the conflict boiling because conflict for Hegel is essential for change and the forward motion of society. Then we have to look at the financial system and the Federal Reserve. The Order was there right from the start. In conclusion we must emphasize one point. An understanding of The Order and its modus operandi is impossible unless the reader holds in mind the Hegelian roots of the game plan. Hegelianism is alien to grass roots America.The national character is straightforward and to the point，not devious and tortuous.The grass roots are still closer to the American Revolution，the Jeffersonian Democrats,the classical liberal school of Cobden and Bright in England,and the Austrian School of Economics where Ludwig von Mises is the undisputed leader. These schools of thought have been submerged in the public eye by the pirate-like onslaught of The Order and its many minions,but they still very much represent the daily operation of American society.From oil billionaire Bunker Hunt in Dallas,Texas to the seventeen year old black trying to “survive” in the Los Angeles ghetto,individual initiative is still more than obvious in American society Above all the reader must - at least temporarily while reading this work - put to one side the descriptive cliches of left and right, liberal and conservative， communist and fascist， even republican and democrat. These terms may be important for self recognition,they do provide a certain reassurance，but they are confusing in our context unless seen as essential elements in a game plan. You will never understand The Order if you try to label it right or left. “The power of the place remain(s) unmistakable. Yale was organized.Yale inspired a loyalty in its sons that was conspicuous and impressive.Yale men in after life made such records that the suspicion was that even there they were working for each other.In short,Yale was exasperatingly and mysteriously successful. To rival institutions and to academic reformers there was something irritating and disquieting about old Yale College.”1 And this success was more than obvious to Yale’s chief competitor, Harvard University.So obvious,in fact,that in 1892a young Harvard instructor,George Santanyana,went to Yale to investigate this“disturbing legend’of Yale power.Santanyana quoted a Harvard alumnus who intended to send his son to Yale - because in real life“all the Har-vard men are working for Yale men.”2 In the 1850s,three members of The Order left Yale and working together,at times with other members along the way,made a revolution that changed the face,direction and purpose", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:29:2c1cf4149287", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4484, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "this success was more than obvious to Yale’s chief competitor, Harvard University.So obvious,in fact,that in 1892a young Harvard instructor,George Santanyana,went to Yale to investigate this“disturbing legend’of Yale power.Santanyana quoted a Harvard alumnus who intended to send his son to Yale - because in real life“all the Har-vard men are working for Yale men.”2 In the 1850s,three members of The Order left Yale and working together,at times with other members along the way,made a revolution that changed the face,direction and purpose of American education.It was a rapid，quiet revolution，and eminently successful.The American people even today,in 1983,are not aware of a coup d’etat. · Timothy Dwight (’49) Professor in the Yale Divinity School and then12th President of Yale University. ·Daniel Coit Gilman (’52)，first President of the University of California, first President of the Johns Hopkins University and first President of the Carnegie Institution. ·Andrew Dickson White (’53),first President of Cornell University and first President of the American Historical Association. Notably also at the University of Berlin in 1856 (at the Institute of Physiology) was none other than Wilhelm Wundt,the founder of experimental psychology in Germany and the later source of the dozens of American PhDs who came back from Leipzig,Germany to start the modern American education movement. There were two groups of these Hegelians. The right Hegelians,were the roots of Prussian militarism and the spring for the unification of Germany and the rise of Hitler.Key names among right Hegelians were Karl Ritter (at the University of Berlin where our trio studied),Baron von Bismarck.and Baron yon Stockmar,confidential adviser to Queen Victoria over in England.Somewhat before this,Karl Theodor Dalberg (1744-1817)，arch-chancellor in the German Reich,related to Lord Acton in England and an Illuminati (Baco v Verulam in the Illuminati code),was a right Hegelian. And what do you think I am “keeping” for? Tell me, some day when you write,for every year makes me feel that I must draw nearer to a point. When I go home to America I must have some definite notions.Day and night I think of that time,and in all I see and do I am planning for being useful at home.Ifind my wishes cling more and more towards a home in New England,and I long for an opportunity to influence New England minds.

For me,it seems as though new notions and wider views of men and things were crowding upon me with wonderful rapidity,and every day and almost every hour I think of some new things which I wish to have accomplished in America…. I find my thoughts,unconsciously,almost,dwelling on the applications of Christianity or the principles of the New Testament to business, study, public education,political questions, travel,and so forth.I had a long talk with Mr. Porter in Berlin (it was three days long with occasional interruptions) on topics related to such as I have named,and he assures me that there are many places in New England ripe for the advocacy of some such views upon these questions as I have often hinted to you at home.I told him a great deal about my thoughts on such things,talking quite as freely and perhaps more fully than I have ever done with you girls at home. He seemed exceedingly interested….He told me that the kind of preaching I spoke of was the kind now needed - the kind which would be most influential of good - and on the whole he encouraged me to attempt it. I feel more and more desirous to do so, and shall keep on, in all I see and hear abroad,with the examination of every influence now working upon men - churches and schools,politics and literature．. His first task in 1856 was to incorporate Skull & Bones as a legal entity under the name of The Russell Trust. Gilman became Treasurer and William H.Russell, the cofounder,was President. It is notable that there is no mention of The Order,Skull& Bones,The Russell Trust,or any secret society activity in Gilman’s biography,nor in open records. The Order，so far as its members are concerned,is designed to be secret,and apart from one or two inconsequential slips,meaningless unless one has the whole picture. The Order has been remarkably adept at keeping its secret. In other words,The Order fulfills our first requirement for a conspiracy - i.e., IT IS SECRET. The information on The Order that we are using surfaced by accident.In a way similar to the surfacing of the Illuminati papers in 1783, when a messenger carrying Iluminati papers was killed and the Bavarian police found the documents.Ail that exists publicly for The Order is the charter of the Russell Trust,and that tells you nothing.

Gilman’s brother had marred the daughter of Chemistry Professor Benjamin Silliman (The Order,1837).This brought Gilman into contact with Professor Dana,also a member of the Silliman family,and this group decided that Gilman should write a report on reorganization of Sheffield. This was done and entitled “Proposed Plan for the Complete Reorganization of the School of Science Connected with Yale College.” While this plan was worked out, friends and members of The Order made moves in Washington，D.C.，and the Connecticut State Legislature to get state funding for the Sheffield Scientific School. The Morrill Land Bill was introduced into Congress in 1857,passed in 1859, but vetoed by President Buchanan.It was later signed by President Lincoln. This bill,now known as the Land Grant College Act, donated public lands for State colleges of agriculture and sciences….and of course Gilman’s report on just such a college was ready.The legal procedure was for the Federal government to issue land scrip in proportion to a state’s representation,but state legislatures first had to pass legislation accepting the scrip.Not only was Daniel Gilman first on the scene to get Federal land scrip,he was first among all the states and grabbed all of Connecticut’s share for Sheffield Scientific School Gilman had,of course，tailored his report to fit the amount forthcoming for Connecticut.No other institution in Connecticut received even a whisper until 1893,when Storrs Agricultural College received a land grant. Of course it helped that a member of The Order，Augustus Brandegee (’49)，was speaker of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1861 when the state bill was moving through,accepting Connecticut’s share for Sheffield.Other members of The Order,like Stephen W. Kellogg (’46) and William Russell (’33)，were either in the State Legislature or had influence from past service. The Order repeated the same grab for public funds in New York State.All of New York’s share of the Land Grant College Act went to Cornell University.Andrew Dickson White,a member of our trio,was the key activist in New York and later became first President of Cornell. Daniel Gilman was rewarded by Yale and became Professor of Physical Geography at Sheffield in 1863. And this,of course,is the great advantage of Hegel for an elite. The State is absolute.But the State is also a fiction.So if The Order can manipulate the State, it in effect becomes the absolute.A neat game.

The Order’s control over all Yale was evident by the 187Os,even under the administration of Noah Porter (1871-1881),who was not a member. In the decades after the 1870s, The Order tightened its grip. The Iconoclast (October 13，1873) summarizes the facts we have presented on control of Yale by The Order,without being fully aware of the details: “They have obtained control of Yale. Its business is performed by them.Money paid to the college must pass into their hands,and be subject to their will. No doubt they are worthy men in themselves,but the many whom they looked down upon while in college，cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands.Men in Wall Street complain that the college comes straight to them for help，instead of asking each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale’s and America’s first men:‘Few will give but Bones men,and they care far more for their society than they do for the college.’ The Woolsey Fund has but a struggling existence，for kindred reasons.” From 1886 to 1899,member Timothy Dwight (’49) was President, followed by another member of The Order,Arthur Twining Hadley (1899 to 1921). Then came James R. Angell (1921-37), not a member of The Order, who came to Yale from the University of Chicago where he worked with Dewey,built the School of Education,and was past President of the American Psychological Association. From 1937 to 1950 Charles Seymour,a member of The Order,was President followed by Alfred Whitney Griswold from 1950 to 1963. Griswold was not a member， but both the Griswold and Whitney families have members in The Order. For example，Dwight Torrey Griswold (’O8) and William Edward Schenk Griswold (99) were in The Order. In 1963 Kingman Brewster took over as President. The Brewster family has had several members in The Order,in law and the ministry rather than education. “Whatever want the college suffers,whatever is lacking in her educational course, whatever disgrace lies in her poor buildings, whatever embarrassments have beset her needy students, so far as money could have availed,the weight of blame lies upon this ill-starred society.

However, it is puzzling that the educational system allowed reading to deteriorate so markedly. It could be that The Order wants the citizen components of the organic State to be little more than automated order takers;after all a citizen who cannot read and write is not going to challenge The Order.But this is surmise.It is not,on the basis of the evidence presently at hand,a provable proposition. In any event, the system adopted the look-say method of learning to read，originally developed for deaf mutes.The system has produced generations of Americans who are functionally iliterate.Yet,reading is essential for learning and learning is essential for most occupations. And certainly those who can read or write lack vocabulary in depth and stylistic skills. There are,of course,exceptions. This author spent five years teaching at a State University in the early 196Os and was appalled by the general inability to write coherent English,yet gratified that some students had not only evaded the system,acquired vocabulary and writing skills,but these exceptions had the most skepticism about The Establishment. Look-say reading methods were developed around 1810 for deaf mutes by a truly remarkable man,Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.Thomas H. Gallaudet was the eldest son of Peter Wallace Gallaudet, descended from a French Huguenot family，and Jane Hopkins. Jane Hopkins traced her ancestry back to John Hopkins and the Reverend Thomas Hooker in the seventeenth century，who broke away from the Congregational Church to help found Hartford,Connecticut. This parallels the story of the Lord family (see Volume One).The Lords also traced their ancestry back to Hopkins and Hooker and the Lords founded Hartford,Connecticut.And it was in Hartford,Connecticut in 1835 that a printer named_Lord produced Thomas Gallaudet’s first look-say primer,Mother’s Primer. Gallaudet’s original intention was to use the look-say method only for deaf mutes who have no concept of a spoken language and are therefore unaware of phonetic sounds for letters.For this purpose, Gallaudet founded the Hartford School for the Deaf in 1817. The Gallaudet system works well for deaf mutes,but there is no obvious reason to use it for those who have the ability to hear sounds. Anyway， in 1835 Mother’s Primer was published and the Massachusetts Primary School Committee under Horace Mann immediately adopted the book on an experimental basis.Later we shall find that Horace Mann ties directly to The Order - in fact,the cofounder", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:35:e9861585e93a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4490, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "phonetic sounds for letters.For this purpose, Gallaudet founded the Hartford School for the Deaf in 1817.

The thrust of the new Dewey-inspired system of education was away from learning and towards preparing a child to be a unit in the organic society.Look-say was ideal for Deweyites. It skipped one step in the learning process. It looked “easy,”and de-emphasized reading skills. The educational establishment rationalized look-say be claiming that up to the turn of the century reading was taught by “synthetic” methods, i.e.， children were taught letters and an associated sound value. Then they learned to join syllables to make words. This was held to be uninteresting and artificial. Educational research, it was claimed, demonstrated that in reading words are not analyzed into component letter parts but seen as complete units.Therefore，learning to read should start with complete units.

The educational establishment argues today in the 1980s that, based on further experimental testing,it is easier for a child to read the line “the rocket zoomed into space” than “the cat sat on the mat.” The first line has “constrasting visual structure” and the second quote has a “similar visual pattern.” For the moment we want to briefly trace the influence of Johann Friedrich Herbart,a major German philosopher of the early 19th century.There was at one time in the United States a National Herbart Society for the Scientific Study of Education to adapt Herbartian principles to American education. Later, this became just National Society for the Study of Education.You don’t hear too much about Johann Herbart today,but his influence survives in the so-called “enriched” school curricula and in current educational methodology. Herbart was an educational theorist as well as philosopher and psychologist,and strongly influenced Wilhelm Wundt. For Herbart, education had to be presented in a scientifically correct manner,and the chief purpose of education for Herbart is to prepare the child to live properly in the social order of which he is an integral part. Following Hegel, the individual is not important. The mere development of individual talent, of individual fitness,mental power and knowledge is not the purpose of education.The purpose is to develop personal character and social morality,and the most important task of the educator is to analyze the activities and duties of men within society. · Johann Gottried Herder (1744-1803) was “Damascus pontifex” in the Illuminato. · Johann Fichte,we have already noted in the previous volume, was close to the Iluminati and pushed by Goethe (“Abaris”) for the post at the University of Jena,where Johann Herbart was studying. ·Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805) was known in the circle but not reliably recorded as an lluminati member. · Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749-1832) was“Abaris” in the Illuminati. Before Herbart completed his doctorate, just after the turn of the 19th century，he spent three years at Interlaken in Switzerland.Out of his contact with Pestalozzi came a book on Pestalozzi’s educational theories，much of which rubbed off onto Herbart.The book is Pestalozzi’s Idee Eines ABC Der Anschaung Untersucht Und Wissenschaftlich Asugefuhrt (Pestalozzi’s idea of an ABC of sense impression).

This book has been translated and we reproduce a copy of the title page of the 1896 New York edition.This is not insignificant. It is a commentary by a prominent influence on today’s education upon an Illuminati book The Illuminati was founded May 1，1776 by Professor Adam Weishaupt of the University of Ingolstadt. It was a secret society,but in 1785 and 1787 several batches of internal documents came to the Bavarian Government. Subsequent investigation determined that the aim of the Illuminati was world domination,using any methods to advance the objective,i.e.,the end always justifies the means. It was anti-Christian,although clergymen were found in the organization. Each member had a pseudonym to disguise his identity. As Rosenbaum has pointed out in his Esquire article,the Illuminati ceremony has similarities to The Order.For example,John Robison in Proofs Of A Conspiracy:1 “The candidate is presented for reception in the character of a slave;and it is demanded of him what has brought him to this most miserable of all conditions.He answers - Society - the State -Submissiveness - False Religion.A skeleton is pointed out to him,at the feet of which are laid a Crown and a Sword.He is asked whether that is the skeleton of a King,a Nobleman or a Beggar? Finally，in conclusion，we can trace the foundation of three secret societies,in fact the most influential three secret societies that we know about，to Universities. The Iluminati was founded at University of Ingolstadt.The Group was founded at All Souls College, Oxford Uni-versity in England,and The Order was founded at Yale University in the United States. On the other hand,Hall is a good example of someone whose life has major turning points and on probing the turning points，we find The Order with its guiding hand.The detail below is important to link Hall with The Order.It is an open question how much Hall knew,if he knew anything at all, about The Order and its objectives. After graduation from Williams College，Hall spent a year at the Union Theological Seminary，New York.Our“Addresses”books for The Order do not give church affiliations for members citing the ministry as their occupation.We do know that Rev.Henry Sloane Coffin (’97) was Associate Professor ofPractical Theology at Union from 1904-1926 and President of Union Seminary from 1926 to 1945,but we cannot trace any members at Union before 1904. “The man to whom I owe far more in this group than any other was Henry B. Smith,a foreign trained scholar，versed more or less not only in systematic theology,which was his chair,but in ancient and modern philosophy,on which he gave us a few lec-tures outside the course.Of him alone I saw something socially.

The Sage family had several “Henrys” involved with Yale and Cornell Universities in those days.The “Henry Sage”cited is probably William Henry Sage (1844-1924) who graduated Yale 1865 and then joined the family lumber company，H.W.Sage & Company in New York. Henry Sage was a member of Scroll & Key - the sister Senior Society to Skull& Bones at Yale. Furthermore, two of Henry Sage’s nephews were in The Order,but well after 1868: In Germany,Hall studied philosophy at the University of Berlin for two years under Hegelians Trendelenberg (Gilman of The Order also studied under Trendelenberg) and Lepsius. There were few American students in Berlin at this time. So few that the American Minister George Bancroft could entertain them at the U.S.Embassy to meet German Chancellor von Bismarck. Again,the detail is important. There are two versions of Hall’s life immediately after returning from his first trip to Germany.According to Hall’s Confessions,he became tutor for the Seligman banking family in New York and was then contacted by James K. Hosmer,Professor at Antioch College,Yellow Springs,Ohio. Hosmer asked,and this is very unusual, if Hall would like his professorial post at Antioch. Said Hall,“I gladly accepted.” Horace Mann, whom we met in Memorandum Two as the promoter of “look-say” reading,was the first President of Antioch (1853-1860). The most prominent trustee of Antioch College was none other than the co-founder of The Order, Alphonso Taft. According to Hall,“(l) occa-sionally spent a Sunday with the Tafts.Ex-President Taft was then a boy and his father, Judge Alonzo (sic) Taft was atrustee of Antioch College” (Confessions,p. 201).

(b) the Unitarian Church,which will enter our later reports, (c)a Hegelian discussion group comprised of left Hegelians,and (d)the co-founder of The Order,Alphonso Taft.And Hall knew William Howard Taft,also a member of The Order (’78) and future President and Chief Justice of the United States. Hall stayed four years at Antioch,then took off again for Europe, while Alphonso Taft went to Washington，D.C.as Secretary of War, then as Attorney General in the Grant Administration.Hall paused a while in England and then went on to Germany, to Leipzig and Wilhelm Wundt.He became the first of a dozen Americans to receive a Ph.D.in psychology (a new field) under Wundt. “I do not know of any other American student of these subjects (i.e.,philosophy and psychology) who came into even the slight personal contact it was my fortune to enjoy with Hartmann and Fechner,nor of any psychologist who had the experience of attempting experimental work with Helmholtz and I thinkI was the first American pupil of Wundt. The twelve years included in this span,more than any other equal period,marked and gave direction to modern psychology. ；1 Eduard von Hartmann (1842-1906),a prominent philosopher.Hartmann’s views on individual rights are entirely contrary to our own, i.e., “The principle of freedom is negative .. . in every department of life, save religion alone,compulsion is necessary…What all men need is rational tyranny,if it only holds them to a steady development,accord-ing to the laws of their own nature.” Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920),Professor of Philosophy at University of Leipzig,was undoubtedly the major influence on G. Stanley Hall. Modern education practice stems from Hegelian social theory combined with the experimental psychology of Wilhelm Wundt. Whereas Karl Marx and von Bismarck applied Hegelian theory to the political field,it was Wilhelm Wundt, influenced by Johann Herbart, who applied Hegel to education,which in turn,was picked up by Hall and John Dewey and modern educational theorists in the United States. Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt was born August 16,1832 at Neckarau, a suburb of Mannheim,Germany.His father Maximilian (1787-1846) was a minister.Wundt’s grandfather on the paternal side is of significant interest: Kirchenrat Karl Kasimir Wundt (1744-84) was Professor at Heidelberg University in the history and geography of Baden and pastor of the church at Wieblingen,a small neighborhood town. The protesting “neutrals” at Yale had no hope of winning.Even under independent President Noah Porter in the 187Os,The Order had Yale University under its control. But while Yale students were watching,protesting and writing bad verse,Daniel Gilman", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:40:6ca31e72fb37", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4495, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "of Mannheim,Germany.His father Maximilian (1787-1846) was a minister.Wundt’s grandfather on the paternal side is of significant interest: Kirchenrat Karl Kasimir Wundt (1744-84) was Professor at Heidelberg University in the history and geography of Baden and pastor of the church at Wieblingen,a small neighborhood town. The protesting “neutrals” at Yale had no hope of winning.Even under independent President Noah Porter in the 187Os,The Order had Yale University under its control. But while Yale students were watching,protesting and writing bad verse,Daniel Gilman ran into opposition 3000 miles away - and if the leaders of this counter revolution had known the story we are recounting here, they might just have stopped The Order dead in its tracks. In California Gilman found a political hornets’ nest. For some years there had been increasing popular concern about the railroad monopolies,qovernment subsidies to railroads and - oddly enough - the Morrill Bill which gave federal land grants to agricultural and scientific colleges. The reader will recall that in Connecticut and New York, The Order had grabbed the total state’s share for Yale and Cornell respectively.Californians believed that the University of California，a land grant college，should teach agriculture and science，whereas Gilman had different ideas.Unrest over corruption,including corruptionamong University of California Regents and the railroads (in which members of The Order had widespread interests),led to formation of a new California political party. In 1873 the party was known as the Patrons of Husbandry or the Grangers.Then members of the Republican Party broke away and joined with the Grangers to form the Peoples Independent Party (known also as the Dolly Varden Party).They won a decisive victory in the 1873 California elections and following investigations by the Grangers,a petition was sent to the Legislature concerning operation of the University of California under Daniel Gilman. At that time Henry George was editor of the San Francisco Daily Eveninq Post and George used his considerable journalistic skills to attack the University, the Regents,Gilman,and the land grants.Although Henry George is known as a socialist,we classify him as an independent socialist,not part of the Hegelian right-left spectrum.His main target was land monopoly,whereas the “scientific” Hegelian socialism of Karl Marx is geared to establishing monopolies of all kinds under state control,following the Hegelian theory of the supremacy of the State. In 1874 the trustees invited three university presidents to come to Baltimore and advise on the choice of a President. These were Charles W.Eliot of Harvard,Andrew Dickson White of Cornell,and James B. Angell of Michigan.Only Andrew Dickson White was in The Order. After meeting independently with each of these presidents.half a dozen of the trustees toured several American Universities in search of further information - and Andrew D.White accompanied the tour.The result was. in the words of James Angell: Johns Hopkins had willed substantial amounts for both a University and a medical school.Dr.William H.Welch (’7O),a fellow member of The Order,was brought in by Gilman to head", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:41:03ef1391bef9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4496, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "Dickson White of Cornell,and James B.

(Welch was President of the Board of Directors of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research for almost 25 years, 1910-1934. This we shall expand upon later in the series when we examine how The Order came to control medicine).For the moment let’s return to G. Stanley Hall who was in Leipzig while Johns Hopkins was acquiring its new President. “l came home,again in the depths because of debt and with no prospects, took a smallflat on the edge of Somerville,where my two children were born,and waited,hoped and worked. One Wednesday morning President Eliot (of Harvard University) rode up to the house,rapped on the door without dismounting from his horse and asked me to begin Saturday of that week a course of lectures on education . ， The rest is known.The chart demonstrates how doctoral students from Wundt and Hallfanned out through the United States,established departments of psychology and education by the score;117 psychological laboratories just in the period up to 1930.Prominent among these students were John Dewey,J.M.Cattell and E.L.Thorndike - all part of the founding of Columbia Teachers’ College and Chicago’s School of Education - the two sources of modern American education. Their activities can be measured by the number of doctorates in educational psychology and experimental psychology granted in the period up to 1948. The following list includes psychologists with training in Germany under Wilhelm Wundt before i9oO,and the number of doctorates they in turn awarded up to 1948: American Students of Wundt Teaching at U.S. NumberofDoctorates They Awarded up to Universities Career At Johns Hopkins and 1948 149 doctorates G.

Judd University of Chicago 196 doctorates Of these only E.B.Titchener at Cornell could be called a critic of the Wundt school of experimental psychology.The rest followed the party line:an amalgamation of Hegelian philosophy and Wundtian animal psychology. In 1886 Timothy Dwight (The Order) had taken over from the last of Yale’s clerical Presidents, Noah Porter. Never again was Yale to get too far from The Order.Dwight was followed by member Arthur T.Hadley (76).Andrew Dickson White was secure as President of Cornell and alternated as U.S.Ambassador to Germany.While in Berlin,White acted as recruiting agent for The Order.Not only G.Stanley Hall came into", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:42:974bda2579cf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4497, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "of experimental psychology.The rest followed the party line:an amalgamation of Hegelian philosophy and Wundtian animal psychology.

Academic associations are a means of conditioning or even policing academics.Although academics are great at talking about academic freedom,they are peculiarly susceptible to peer group pressures.And if an academic fails to get the word through his peer group,there is always the threat of not getting tenure.In other words,what is taught at University levels is passed through a sieve.The sieve is faculty conformity. In this century when faculties are larger,conformity cannot be imposed bya President. It is handled equally well through faculty tenure committees and publications committees of academic associations. We have already noted that member Andrew Dickson White founded and was first President of the American Historical Association and therefore was able to influence the constitution and direction of the AHA. This has generated an official history and ensured that existence of The Order is never even whispered in history books,let alone school texts. An economic association is also of significance because it conditions how people who are not economists think about the relative merits of free enterprise and state planning. State economic planning is an essential part of State political control. Laissez faire in economics is the equivalent of individualism in politics.And just as you will never find any plaudits for the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution in official history,neither will you find any plaudits for individual free enterprise. The collectivist nature of present day college faculties in economics has been generated by the American Economic Association under influence of The Order. There are very few outspoken preachers of the Austrian School of Economics on American campuses today. They have been effectively weeded out. Even Ludwig von Mises,undisputed leader of the school,was unable to.find a teaching post in the United States. So much for academic freedom in economics.And it speaks harshly for the pervasive,deadening,dictatorial hand of the American Economics Association.And the controlling hand,as in the American Psychological Association and the American Historical Association, traces back to The Order. Ely descended from Richard Ely of Plymouth, England who settled at Lyme, Connecticut in 1660.

Ely descended from Richard Ely of Plymouth, England who settled at Lyme, Connecticut in 1660. On his grandmother’s side (and you have heard this before for members of The Order) Ely descended from the daughter of Rev.Thomas Hooker, founder of Hartford,Connecticut. On the paternal side,Ely descended from Elder William Brewster of Plymouth Colony. When Ely arrived home,Daniel Gilman invited Ely to take the Chair of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins. Ely accepted at about the same time Gilman appointed G.Stanley Hall to the Chair of Philosophy and Pedagogy and William Welch,a member of The Order we have yet to describe,tu be Dean of the Johns Hopkins medical school. Fortunately， Richard Ely was an egocentric and left an autobiography,Ground Under Our Feet,which he dedicated to none other than Daniel Coit Gilman (see illstration).Then on page 54 of this autobiography is the caption “I find an invaluable friend in Andrew D. White.”And in Ely’s first book, French And German Socialism,we find the following: “The publication of this volume is due to the friendly counsel of the Honorable Andrew D.White,President of Cornell University, a gentleman tireless in his efforts to encourage young men and alive to every opportunity to speak fittng words of hope and cheer. Like many of the younger scholars of our country,I am indebted to him more than I can say. Ely recalls his conversations with White,and makes a revealing comment:“I was interested in his psychology and the way he worked cleverly with Ezra Cornell and Mr. Sage, a benefactor and one of the trustees of Cornell University.” The reader will remember it was Henry Sage who provided the first funds for G. Stanley Hall to study in Germany. Then Ely says,“The only explanation Ican give for his special interest in me was the new ideas I had in relation to economics.”And what were these new ideas? Ely rejected classical liberal economics,including free trade,and noted that free trade was“particularly obnoxious to the German school of thought by which I was so strongly impressed.” In other words, just as G. Stanley Hall had adopted Hegelianism in psychology from Wundt,Ely adopted Hegelian ideas from his prime teacher Karl Knies at University of Heidelberg. And both Americans had come to the watchful attention of The Order.The staff of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin never did appreciate why a young American student, not attached to the Embassy,was hired by Ambassador White to make a study of the Berlin City Government. That was Ely’s test, and he passed it with flying colors.

The rest is history.Daniel Coit Gilman invited Richard Ely to Johns Hopkins University.From there Ely went on to head the department of economics at University of Wisconsin.Through the ability to influence choice of one’s successor.Wisconsin has been a center of statist economics down to the present day. The clue is that young Edward Mandell House went to school at Hopkins Grammar School,New Haven,Connecticut. House knew The Order from school days.In fact one of House’s closest classmates at Hopkins Grammar School was member Arthur Twining Hadley (’76), who went on to become President of Yale University (1899 to 1921). And it was Theodore Roosevelt who surfaced Hadley’s hidden philosophy: “Years later Theodore Roosevelt would term Arthur Hadiey his fellow anarchist and say that if their true views were known, they would be so misunderstood that they would both lose their jobs as President of the United States and President of Yale.”1 House’s novel, Philip Dru，was written in New Haven,Connecticut and in those days House was closer to the Taft segment of The Order than Woodrow Wilson. In fact House,as we shall see later，was The Order’s messenger boy. House was also something of a joker because part of the story of The Order is encoded within Philip Dru! Back in the late 19th century American medicine was in a deplorable state. To the credit of the Rockefeller General Education Board and the Institute for Medical Research．funds were made available to staff teaching hospitals and to eradicate some pretty horrible diseases.On the other hand.a chemical-based medicine was introduced and the medical profession cut its ties with naturopathy.Cancer statistics tell you the rest. “The bluntness was characteristic of Mr. Gates,but the question about the million dollars was hardly in accord with his usual indirect and cautious approach to the spending of money.Flexner’s reply，however,to the effect that any funds - a million dollars or otherwise - could most profitably be spent in developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School, struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. William H. Welch, the dean of the institution.” The constitution for UNESCO was written largely by The Order,i.e., member Archibald MacLeish. And member William Chauvenet (1840) was“largely responsible for establishing the U.S.Naval Academy on a firm scientific basis.” Chauvenet was director of the Observatory,U.S. Naval Academy，Annapolis from 1845", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:45:ca2e6d387a74", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4500, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "or otherwise - could most profitably be spent in developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School, struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. William H.

Finally，a point on methodology.The reader will remember from Memorandum One (Voume One) that we argued the most“general” solution to a problem in science is the most acceptable solution.In brief, a useful hypothesis is one that explains the most events.Pause a minute and reflect. We are not developing a theory that includes numerous superficially unconnected events. For example,the founding of Johns Hopkins University， the introduction ofWundtian educational methodology,a psychologist G. Stanley Hall,an economist Richard T. Ely,a politician Woodrow Wilson - and now we have included such disparate events as Colonel Edward House and the U.S.Naval Observatory.The Order links to them all ．…and several hundred or thousand other events yet to be unfolded. So let’s interpose another principle of scientific methodology. How do we finally know that our hypothesis is valid? If our hypothesis is correct,then we should be able to predict not only future conduct of The Order but also events where we have yet to conduct research.This is still to come.However, the curious reader may wish to try it out. Select a major historical event and search for the guiding hand of The Order.

From Johns Hopkins Dewey went as Professor of Philosophy to University of Michigan and in i886 published Psychology，a blend of Hegelian philosophy applied to Wundtian experimental psychology. It sold well. In 1894 Dewey went to University of Chicago and in 1902 was appointed Director of the newly founded - with Rockefeller money - School of Education. The University of Chicago itself had been founded in 1890 with Rockefeller funds - and in a future volume we will trace this through Frederick Gates (of Hartford，Connecticut)，and the Pilsbury family (The Order). The University of Chicago and Columbia Teachers’ College were the key training schools for modern education. Lookinq back at John Dewey after 8O years of his influence,he can be recognized as the pre-eminent factor in the collectivisation，or Hegelianization，of American Schools.Dewey was consistently a philosopher of social change.That’s why his impact has been so deep and pervasive.And it is in the work and implementation of the ideas of John Dewey that we can find the objective of The Order. When The Order brought G. Stanley Hall from Leipzig to Johns Hopkins University,John Dewey was already there,waiting to write his doctoral dissertation on “The Psychology of Kant.” Already a Hegelian in philosophy, he acquired and adapted the experimental psychology of Wundt and Hall to his concept of education for social change. To illustrate this, here’s a quote from John Dewey in My Pedagogic Creed: “The school is primarily a social institution.Education being a social process,the school is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends. Education, therefore,is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.” This is where the gulf of misunderstanding between modern parents and the educational system begins. Parents believe a child goes to school to learn skills to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:48:e3ccd4ed93aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4503, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends. Education, therefore,is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.” This is where the gulf of misunderstanding between modern parents and the educational system begins. Parents believe a child goes to school to learn skills to use in the adult world，but Dewey states specifically that education is“not a preparation for future living.” The Dewey educational system does not accept the role of developing a child’s talents but,contrarily,only to prepare the child to function as a unit in an organic whole - in blunt terms a cog in the wheel of an organic society.Whereas most Americans have moral values rooted in the individual, the values of the school system are rooted in the Hegelian concept of the State as the absolute. No wonder there is misunderstanding! John Dewey tried to brush the freedom of the individual to one side. In an article,“Democracy and Educational Administration”(School & Society，XVL，1937，p. 457) Dewey talks about the“lost individual,” and then restates Hegel in the following way:“freedom is the participation of every mature human being in formation of the values that regulate the living of men together.”This is pure Hegel, i.e.,man finds freedom only in obedience to the State.As one critic,Horace M.Kallen stated，John Dewey had a “blindness to the sheer individuality of individuals.” In other words, for Dewey man has no individual rights.Man exists only to serve the State.This is directly contradictory to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution with the preamble “We the people.”They then go on to define the rights of the state which are always subordinate and subject to the will of “We the people.’ “An attempt should be made to redress the present overemphasis on individualism in current programs．.．students need to develop a sense of community and collective identity.” (Educational Leadership，May 1982，William B.Stanley，Asst.Professor，Dept．of Curriculum and Instruction，Louisiana State University). There was no need for Hegel to describe education,and so far as we know there is no statement purely on education in Hegel’s writings. It is unnecessary.For Heqel every quality of an individual exists only at the mercy and will of the State.This approach is reflected in political svstems based on Hegel whether it be Soviet Communism or Hitlerian national socialism.John Dewey follows Hegel’s organic view of society. For example: “It is now time for a new vision of ourselves,of man,of human nature and of human potential,and a new theory of politics and institutions premised upon that vision.What is that vision of Man? That the natural,whole,organismic human being is loving．. that man’s basic thrust is towards community” (quoted in Rex Myles,Brotherhood and Darkness,p.347).

Stripped of the pedantic language it is new world order,a world organic society.But there is no provision for a global organic order within the Constitution.In fact, it is illegal for any government oficer or elected official to move the United States towards such an order as it would clearly be inconsistent with the Constitution. To be sure,Dewey was not a government official, but Vasconcellos has taken an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. It’s difficult to see what the new world order has to do with education of children,but it’s there in the literature.Fichte,Hegel’s predecessor from whom many of his philosophical ideas originated,had a definite concept of a League of Nationas (Volkerbund) and the idea of a league to enforce peace.Fichte asserted“As this federation spreads further and gradually embraces the whole earth, perpetual peace begins,the only lawful relation among states . “When community educators say that community education takes into consideration the total individual and his total environment, thev mean precisely this: the field of community education includes the individual in his total psycho-physical structure and his entire ecological climate with all its ramifications - social, political,economical,cultural,spiritual,etc. It seeks to integrate the individual within himself (sic) and within his community until the individual becomes a cosmic soul and the community the world.” “The Cosmic soul.. . the whole human race is going to evolve an effective soul of its own - the cosmic soul of the race.That is the future of human evolution. As a result of the emergence of the universal soul, there will be a great unification of the entire human race,ushering into existence a new era,a new dawn of unique world power.” It also appears that some Yale graduates who are not members of The Order will act towards objectives desired by The Order. Some of these,for example Dean Acheson,we can identify as members of Scroll & Key,or with relatives in The Order. Others yet to be brought into our discussion are members of Wolf’s Head (for example, Reeve Schley, who worked for the Rockefellers)．Still others，for example Robert Maynard Hutchins (Fund for the Republic),are Yale graduates but not yet identified as members of any Yale senior society.It appears at this point that Ron Rosenbaum’s assertion (in Esquire,1977),that members of the Eastern Establishment who are not members of Skull & Bones will be members of either Scroll & Key or Wolf’s Head is holding up.

(2) So far as education is concerned，look-say reading originated with Thomas Gallaudet and was designed for deaf mutes. The elder Gallaudet was not a member of The Order,but his two sons (Edson and Herbert Gallaudet) were initiated in 1893 and 1898.Horace Mann,a significant influence in modern educational theory and the first promoter of “look-say,”was not a member.However,Mann was President of Antioch College,and the Tafts (The Order) were the most powerful trustees of Antioch. (3)We traced John Dewey’s philosophy，that education is to prepare a person to fit into society rather than develop individual talents,to Herbart who was influenced by the Swiss Pestalozzi. Personal development cannot be achieved by developing individual talents,it must take the form of preparation to serve society，according to Herbart，Dewey and Pestalozzi.Pestalozzi was a member of the Illuminati,with the code name“Alfred.” (4) The scene shifts in the late 19th century from Yale to Johns Hopkins University.Member Daniel Coit Gilman is the first President of Johns Hopkins and he has handpicked either members of The Order (Welch) or Hegelians for the new departments.G. Stanley Hall, the first of Wilhelm Wundt’s American students，began the process of Americanization of Wundt, established the first experimental psychology laboratory for education in the United States with funds from Gilman,and later started the Journal Of Psychology. (5) The Order was able to acquire all the Morill Act land grant entitlements for New York and Connecticut for Cornell and Yale respectively.However，member Gilman ran into trouble as President of University of California on the question of the California land grants and corruption among the University regents. The first organized opposition to The Order came from the San Francisco Times,but editor Henry George was not fully aware of the nature of his target. (6) The core of The Order’s impact on education can be seen as a troika: Gilman at Johns Hopkins,White at Cornell (and U.S.Minister to Germany) and Dwight,followed by member Hadley,at Yale.Andrew White was first President of the American Historical Association. Richard T. Ely (not a member but aided by The Order) became a founder and first secretary of the American Economic Association. Members can also be traced into such diverse areas as the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Union Theological Seminary. (7）John Dewey,the originator of modern educational theory,took his doctorate at Johns Hopkins under Hegelians. Dewey’s work is pure Hegel in theory and practice,and is totally inconsistent with the Constitution of the U.S.and rights of the individual.A comparison of German Hegelians, John Dewey and modern educational theorists demonstrates the parallelism.

Children do not go to school to develop individual talents but to be prepared as units in an organic society. Criticism of the educational system today bypasses the fundamental philosophic aspect and focuses on omissions,i.e.，that the kids can’t read,write, spell or undertake simple mathematical exercise. If we look at the educational system through the eyes of The Order and its objectives,then the problems shift. They appear to be preparing children for a political objective which also happens to be the objective of The Order. The emphasis is on global living，preparing for a global society.It is apparently of no concern to the educational establishment that children can’t read, can’t write,and can’t do elementary mathematics …. but they are going to be ready for the Brave New World.

Memorandum Number Nine: Conclusions And Recommendations Recommendations for reform have been forthcoming at intervals since the late 1950s when educational problems first surfaced.At the time of Sputnik there was a hue and cry about the backward nature of U.S.training in mathematics and science,which at the University level are not at all backward. Anyway the educational establishment recognized an opportunity and cried,“more,more money.”They got it,and there was a massive expansion in the ’6Os. But the funds have been poured into social conditioning.Mathematics and sciences have taken back seat in the last 30 years. Then in 1981, James S.Coleman of the University of Chicago produced a study of public schools for the U.S. Department of Education. In this study Coleman used the National Opinion Research Center to contact 58,728 sophomores and seniors in 1,016 public,parochial, and private schools across the United States.His findings were: · private and parochial schools provide an education closer to the common school ideal than do public schools, ·private school students learned more than public school counterparts, · Coleman wrote it was paradoxical that “catholic schools function much closer to the American ideal of the common school ．．.than do public schools.” ·private schools provide “a safer，more disciplined and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:52:728525aca32a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4507, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "National Opinion Research Center to contact 58,728 sophomores and seniors in 1,016 public,parochial, and private schools across the United States.His findings were: · private and parochial schools provide an education closer to the common school ideal than do public schools, ·private school students learned more than public school counterparts, · Coleman wrote it was paradoxical that “catholic schools function much closer to the American ideal of the common school ．．.than do public schools.” ·private schools provide “a safer，more disciplined and more ordered environment’ than public schools, · “blacks and Hispanics perform beter at private schools.” · the function of the school is to develop individual talent. Social engineering as an objective has to be discarded. · A thorough grounding in the 3 R’s is essential for a good educa-tion.In other words,“content’is all important. · It follows that Schools of Education should be abolished (this is under serious discussion at Duke University and has been proposed at University of Michigan and even Cal Berkeley). · Teacher credentials should be based on subject matter entirely, not educational theory. · All restrictions on private schools should be abolished. · Public schools should be returned to local control. From this axiom it follows that controlled conflict can create a predetermined history.For example:When the.Trilateral Commission discusses “managed conflict”,as it does extensively in its literature,the Commission implies the managed use of conflict for long run predetermined ends - not for the mere random exercise of manipulative control to solve a problem. The dialectic takes this Trilateral “managed conflict” process one step further. In Hegelian terms,an existing force (the thesis) generates a counterforce (the antithesis).Conflict between the two forces results in the forming of a synthesis.Then the process starts all over again: Thesis vs.antithesis results in synthesis. The synthesis sought by the Establishment is called the New World Order.Without controlled conflict this New World Order will not come about. Random individual actions of persons in society would not lead to this synthesis, it’sartificial, therefore it has to be created.And this is being done with the calculated,managed,use of conflict.And all the while this synthesis is being sought,there is no profit in playing the involved parties against one another.This explains why the International bankers backed the Nazis, the Soviet Union,North Korea,North Vietnam,ad nauseum,against the United States.The “conflict’ built profits while pushing the world ever closer to One World Government. The process continues today. We apologize for the poor quality of some documents included in this volume.These are the best copies in existence today.

However,even where contents cannot be clearly identified, the very existence of even a fragmentary text proves a vital point: There is a joint calculated effort among Patriarchs to bring about a specific objective. Furthermore,the diverse conflicting nature of these efforts, commented upon even in letters between Patriarchs,can only be explained in the terms of the Hegelian dialectic. Our first hypothesis,that the U.S.was ruled by an elite, secret society,was supported by documentary evidence: such a secret society does exist,its membership is concealed,and disclosure of membership is not a voluntary effort.Further, since publication of the first volume, the Sterling Library at Yale University which has major holdings of their records has refused to allow researchers further access to Russell Trust papers (the legal name for The Order). We also argued in the first volume that the operations of The Order must be seen and explained in terms of the Hegelian dialectic process. Their operations cannot be explained in terms of any other philosophy; therefore The Order cannot be described as“right’or“left,” secular or religious,Marxist or Capitalist.The Order,and its objectives,is all of these and none of these. Our descriptive world history in the West and Marxist countries consists only of description and analysis within a political framework of “right”or“left.”For example,historical work published in the West looks at communism and socialism either through the eyes of financial capitalism or Marxism.Historical work published in the Soviet Union looks at the West only through Marxist eyes.However,there is another frame for historical analysis that has never (so far as we can determine) been utilized, i.e., to use a framework of Hegelian logic,to determine if those elites who control the State use the dialectic process to create a predetermined historical synthesis. Only tantalizing glimpses of any such creative process can be found in modern historical works. The most convincing glimpses are in the late Carroll Quigley’s Tragedy And Hope which we shall quote below. Rarely some politicians on the periphery of elitist power have allowed brief insights into the public eye.For example,President Woodrow Wilson made the revealing statement:“Some of the biggest men in the U.S.in the fields of commerce and manufacturing know that there is a power so organized, so subtle,so complete,so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.”” This series argues that the current world situation has been deliberately created by this elitist power more or less by manipulation of “right” and“left”elements.We argue that the most powerful of all world elites", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:54:57d8a828b91c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4509, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "Woodrow Wilson made the revealing statement:“Some of the biggest men in the U.S.in the fields of commerce and manufacturing know that there is a power so organized, so subtle,so complete,so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.”” This series argues that the current world situation has been deliberately created by this elitist power more or less by manipulation of “right” and“left”elements.We argue that the most powerful of all world elites has during the past 1OO years or so developed both right and left elements to bring about a New World Order. There is no question that the so-called establishment in the U.S. uses “managed conflict.”The practice of “managing” crises to bring about a favorable outcome,that is, favorable to the elite,is freely admitted in the literature of,for example,The Trilateral Commission.Furthermore, there is no question that decisions of war and peace are made by a few in the elite and not by the many in the voting process through a political referendum. This volume explores some major conflict decisions made by the few in The Order and the way in which right-left situations have been deliberately created and then placed in a conflict mode to bring about a synthesis. Throughout the last 20O years,since the rise of Kant in German philosophy,we can identify two conflicting systems of philosophy and so opposing ideas of the State,society and culture. In the U.S., the British Commonwealth and France,philosophy is based on the individual and the rights of the individual. Whereas in Germany from the time of Kant,through Fichteand Hegel up to 1945,theroot philosophy has been universal brotherhood, rejection of individualism and general opposition to Western classical liberal thought in almost all its aspects. German idealism,as we noted in earlier volumes of this series,was the philosophical basis for the work of Karl Marx and the Left Hegelians as well as Bismarck,Hitler and the Right Hegelians.This is the paradox: that Hegel gave a theoretical basis not only to the most conservative of German movements,but also to most of the revolutionary movements of the 19th century. Both Marx and Hitler have their philosophical roots in Hegel. From the Hegelian system of political thought,alien to most of us in the West, stem such absurdities as the State seen as the “march of God through history,”that the State is also God,that the only duty of a citizen is to serve God by serving the State, that the State is Absolute Reason，thata citizen can only find freedom by worship and utter obedience to the State.However,we also noted in How The Order Controls Education that Hegelian absurdities have thoroughly penetrated the U.S.educational system under pressure from such organizations as the National Education Association and major foundations. From this system of Hegelian philosophy comes the historical dialectic,i.e.,that all historical events emerge from a conflict between opposing forces.These emerging events are above and different", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:55:c5044f7277cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4510, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "God by serving the State, that the State is Absolute Reason，thata citizen can only find freedom by worship and utter obedience to the State.However,we also noted in How The Order Controls Education that Hegelian absurdities have thoroughly penetrated the U.S.educational system under pressure from such organizations as the National Education Association and major foundations. From this system of Hegelian philosophy comes the historical dialectic,i.e.,that all historical events emerge from a conflict between opposing forces.These emerging events are above and different from the conflicting events.Any idea or implementation of an idea may be seen as THESiS. This thesis will encourage emergence of opposing forces, known as ANTITHESIS.The final outcome will be neither thesis nor antithesis,but a synthesis of the two forces in conflict. Karl Marx,in Das Kapital, posed capitalism as thesis and communism as antithesis.What has been completely ignored by historians, including Marxists, is that any clash between these forces cannot lead to a society which is either capitalist or communist but must lead to a society characterized by a synthesis of the two conflicting forces.The clash of opposites must in the Hegelian system bring about a society neither capitalist nor communist. Moreover, in the Hegelian scheme of events, this new synthesis will reflect the concept of the State as God and the individual as totally subordinate to an all powerful State. Compare this to the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States:“We the people” grant the state some powers and reserve all others to the people. Separation of church and state is built into the U.S.Constitution, a denial of Hegel’s “the State is God on earth.” Yet, compare this legal reguirement to the actions of The Order in the United States，The Group in England,the Iluminati in Germany,and the Politburo in Russia.For these elitists the State is supreme and a selfappointed elite running the State acts indeed as God on earth. The concept of the Hegelian dialectic is obviously beyond the comprehension of modern textbook writers.No historical or political theory textbook that we know of discusses the possible use of the Hegelian dialectic in American politics.Yet its use has been recorded by Professor Carroll Quigley in Tragedy And Hope，a trade book based on documents of the Council on Foreign Relations. Quigley not only describes banker J.P.Morgan’s use of the“right”and the\"left’as com-petitive devices for political manipulation of society, but adds an eyeopening comment: This much larger picture is partly revealed in this book.First let’s briefly note how J.P.Morgan used the dialectic process as a means of political control for financial ends.The only college attended by Morgan was 2-3 years in the mid-1850s at University of Gottingen, Germany, which was a center of Hegelian activism. We have no record that Morgan joined any secret society， no more than the KONK-NEIPANTEN, one of the student corps.Yet German Hegelianism is apparent in J.P.Morgan’s approach to political parties - Morgan used them all.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:56:696fdfcd164d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4511, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "revealed in this book.First let’s briefly note how J.P.Morgan used the dialectic process as a means of political control for financial ends.The only college attended by Morgan was 2-3 years in the mid-1850s at University of Gottingen, Germany, which was a center of Hegelian activism. We have no record that Morgan joined any secret society， no more than the KONK-NEIPANTEN, one of the student corps.Yet German Hegelianism is apparent in J.P.Morgan’s approach to political parties - Morgan used them all. “The associations between Wall Street and the Left, of which Mike Straight is a fair example，are really survivals of the associations between the Morgan Bank and the Left.To Morgan all political parties were simply organizations to be used,and the firm always was careful to keepa foot in all camps.Morgan himself,Dwight Morrow，and other partners were allied with Republicans; Russell C.Leffingwell was allied with the Democrats; Grayson Murphy was allied with the extreme Right; and Thomas W.Lamont was allied with the Left. Like the Morgan interest in libraries,museums,and art,its inability to distinguish between loyalty to the United Statesandloyalty to England,itsrecognition of the need for social work among the poor，the multipartisan political views of the Morgan firm in domestic politics went back to the original founder of the firm，George Peabody (1795-1869)．To this same seminal figure may be attributed the use of tax-exempt foundations for controlling these activities,as may be observed in many parts of America to this day，in the use of Peabody foundations to support Peabody libraries and museums.Unfortunately,we do not have space here for this great and untold story,but it must be remembered that what we do say is part of a much larger picture.” (Ibid) Quigley did not know of the link between the Morgan firm, other New York financial interests and The Order.As we have noted before, Quigley did publish a valuable expose of the British Establishment known as“The Group.”And we know from personal correspondence that Quigley suspected more than he published,but identification of an American elite was not part of Quigley’s work. The names Harriman, Bush，Acheson,Whitney - even Stimson - do not appear in The Anglo American Establishment. We can therefore take the above paragraph from Quigley’s Tragedy And Hope and insert identification of The Order. The paragraph then becomes more revealing.Although Morgan himself was not a member of The Order,some of his partners were,and after Morgan’s death the firm became Morgan, Stanley & Co. The“Stanley”was Harold Stanley (The Order 1908). In Morgan’s time the influence of The Order came through partner Henry P.Davison,whose son H.P.Davison, Jr.was initiated in 1920.The elder HenryP.Davison brought Thomas Lamont and Willard Straight into the Morgan firm. These partners were instrumental in building the left wing of Morgan’s dialectic,including the Communist Party U.S.A. (with Julius Hammer，whose son is today Chairman of Occidental Petroleum). Morgan partner Thomas Cochran was initiated in 1904.However, it was in the network of Morgan dominated and affiliated firms,rather than in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:57:9f93a4d49105", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4512, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "Order 1908).

Morgan partner Thomas Cochran was initiated in 1904.However, it was in the network of Morgan dominated and affiliated firms,rather than in the partnership itself, that one finds members of The Order.In firms like Guaranty Trust and Bankers Trust, somewhat removed from the J.P.Morgan financial center,although under Morgan control, we find concentrations of initiates (as we shall describe below). This practice by The Order of supporting both “right’and “left” persists down to the present day.We find in 1984,for example,that Averell Harriman (The Order ’13) is elder statesman of the Democratic Party while George Bush (The Order ’49) is a Republican Vice President and leader of the misnamed “moderate” (actually extremist) wing of the Republican Party.In the center we have so-called “independent” John Anderson,who in fact receives heavy financial support from the elite. College textbooks present war and revolution as more or less accidental results of conflicting forces.The decay of political negotiation into phvsical conflict comes about，according to these books，after valiant efforts to avoid war.Unfortunately，this is nonsense.War is always a deliberate creative act by individuals. Western textbooks also have gigantic gaps.For example,after World War Il the Tribunals set up to investigate Nazi war criminals were careful to censor any materials recording Western assistance to Hitler.By the same token,Western textbooks on Soviet economic development omit any description of the economic and financial aid given to the 1917 Revolution and subsequent economic development by Western firms and banks. Consequently it can be argued that our Western history is every bit as distorted,censored,and largely useless as that of Hitler’s Germany or the Soviet Union or Communist China. No Western foundation will award grants to investigate such topics,few Western academics can “survive”by researching such theses and certainly no major publisher will easily accept manuscripts reflecting such arguments. In the following Memorandum Number Two we will describe the operational vehicles used to create two revolutions and one world conflict.Then,in Memoranda Three and Four,we will explore thesis and antithesis in one major historical episode - the development and construction of the Soviet Union (thesis) and Hitler’s Germany (antithesis). In Memorandum Five we will explore the continuation of this dialectic conflict into the last few decades, specifically Angola and China today. We will show that the purpose of The Order is to create a new synthesis, a New World Order along Hegelian lines where the State is the Absolute and the individual can find freedom only in blind obedience to the State. To illustrate this mind set, let’s look at a report on revolutionaries in the U.S.compiled by the respected", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:58:fe56aae8cb71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4513, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "Memorandum Five we will explore the continuation of this dialectic conflict into the last few decades, specifically Angola and China today. We will show that the purpose of The Order is to create a new synthesis, a New World Order along Hegelian lines where the State is the Absolute and the individual can find freedom only in blind obedience to the State. To illustrate this mind set, let’s look at a report on revolutionaries in the U.S.compiled by the respected Scotland Yard (London) in 1919. London police investigators were then tracking the Bolshevik Revolu-tion and attempting to identify its Western supporters.When it came to men with long beards and even longer overcoats,most police departments had no problem - they looked like revolutionaries,therefore, they must be revolutionaries.But when it came to respectable blacksuited bankers,Scotland Yard was unable to rise above its mind set and recognize that bankers might equally be revolutionaries.Witness this extract from a Scotland Yard Intelligence Report.1 Even today the FBl has a similar mind set.For example，David Rockefeller has met regularly with a KGB agent in the United States - weekly lunch meetings is a close description.Yet the FBl presumably can’t bring itself to investigate David Rockefeller as a potential Soviet agent,but if Joe Smith of Hoboken,N.J.was lunching weekly with the KGB,you can be sure the FBl would be on his tail. And,of course,our domestic U.S.Marxists find it absolutely inconceivable that a capitalist would support communism. Organizations like Scotland Yard and the FBI，and almost all academics on whom investigators rely for their guidelines,have a highly important failing: they look at known verifiable historical facts with a mind set. They convince themselves that they have the explanation of a problem even before the problem presents itself. The operation actually began before 1917. In later volumes we wil explore the Spanish-American War and the Anglo-Boer War of 1899. The first was created by The Order,i.e., the U.S.elite,and the second by “The Group,”i.e., the British elite (with some U.S. assistance).We might aptly term these the First and Second Hegelian Wars,but this is another story. In this volume we are limited to the rise of Hitler in Germany and the rise of the Marxist state in the Soviet Union.The clash between these two powers or the political systems they represent was a major source of World War II. After World War II the world stage was changed.After 1945 it became the Soviet Union on one side versus the United States on the other.The first dialectical clash led to the formation of the United Nations,an elementary step on the road to world government. The second dialectical clash led to the Trilateral Commission,i.e., regional group-ings and more subtly to efforts for a merger of the United States and the Soviet Union.

The name William Averell Harriman turns up behind world political scenes more frequently than any other member of The Order.Possibly it’s because Harriman is a remarkably active man.Born in 1891, graduated Yale 1913,Harriman is still newsworthy in the 1980s.In June 1983 Harriman had a private meeting with Yuri Andropov in Moscow and in December 1983,at 92,broke his right leg while swimming in the sea off Barbados.Whatever else we say here about Averell, we must record his truly remarkable energy and longevity. In official Harriman biographies,however, there is no mention of The Order，Skull & Bones，or the Russell Trust.Like other initiates Harriman has carefully expunged membership from the public record.We have not yet determined if this membership was ever made known to the FBl for use in background checks needed for government positions, or maybe no one ever bothered to ask for a background check on Averell Harriman. To understand Averell Harriman we need to go back to his father, Edward H.Harriman,the 19th century“robber baron.”Edward Harriman’s biography (E.H.Harriman:A Biography) is as self-serving as all hired biographies. It was written by George Kennan (published by Houghton Mifflin in 1922) who was active in the Dean Acheson State Department. The author of the famous - some say infamous - National Security Council document 68 was none other than George Kennan. (See page 175) Even the widely accepted Dictionary of American Biography states that Harriman was subsequently guilty of a combination in restraint of trade (19O4 Northern Securities case)，that his dubious financial activities netted him $60 million in a manner which led to investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This source cites Harriman as “an example of how a road may be drained of its resources for the benefit of insiders.” Harriman printed securities with a nominal value of $80 million to expand capitalization of his railroads.On the other hand,Harriman neglected to acquire improvements and property for more than $18 million. In other words, $60 million of the securities was water,mostly sold through Kuhn Loeb & Co.，his backers and bankers.The $60 million went into Harriman’s pocket. In brief,Mr.Edward H.Harriman was apparently a thief,a crook, and a felon,because fraudulent conversion of $60 million isa felony. Harriman stayed out of jail by judicious expenditures to politicians and political parties.Bioqrapher George Kennan relates how Harriman responded to President Theodore Roosevelt’s 1904 plea for $250, 000 for the Republican National Committee.2 These funds were turned over to the Committee by Harriman’s friend and attorney，Judge Robert Scott Lovett. Lovett was also general counsel for the Union Pacific Railroad and could be described as Harriman’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:60:7d26663bec68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4515, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "was apparently a thief,a crook, and a felon,because fraudulent conversion of $60 million isa felony.

Let’s take one example:an article written by Averell Harriman,published in Look, October 3, 1967 and entitled “From Stalin to Kosygin: the myths and the realities.” In fact, the Soviets expropriated the concessions of the 1920s including Harriman’s，usually without reimbursement. Harriman was doublecrossed by the Soviets in his Georgian manganese concession, then persuaded to take $3 million in Soviet bonds as compensation (See documents printed on pages 154-155). This Soviet “compensation”in effect put Harrman in a position of making the first U.S.loan to Russia,so breaching United States law against such loans. (2) “On the Russian side,one of the most troublesome myths is that America is run by a ruling circle,‘made up of Wall Streeters and industrialists who have an interest in continuing the cold war and the arms race to prop up the ‘capitalist’ economy. Anybody who knows American politics knows what nonsense this is. Unfortunately, the Russians are largely right on the political aspects of this one. In making the above statement Harriman not only confirms Russian paranoia,i.e., that capitalists can’t be trusted to tell the truth, but also deceives the American reading audience in Look that they do in fact，have a participation in running political affairs. Compare this paragraph to this series on The Order and you willsee the devious way the Harriman mind works,perhaps not so different than Harriman senior. The previously described official Harriman biography suggests that Harriman, given his decades on the political inside,must be well aware of the dependence of the Soviet Union on Western technology: that the Soviet Unicn can make no economic progress without Western enterprise technology. In fact, Stalin himself told Harriman as much back in 1944.Here’s an extract from a report by Ambassador Harriman in Moscow to the State Department，dated June 30,1944: In brief, Harriman knew first hand back in 1944 at least that the West had built the Soviet Union.Now examine Harriman’s official biography with its string of appointments relating to.NATO，Mutual Security Agency, State Department, foreign policy,and so on. In these posts Harriman actively pushed for a military build-up of the United States.But if the Soviet Union was seen to be an enemy in 1947, then we had no need to build a massive defense.

Guaranty Trust was founded 1864 in New York.Over the next 100 years the banking firm expanded rapidly by absorbing other banks and trust companies;in 191O it merged Morton Trust Company,in 1912 the Standard Trust Company,and in 1929 the National Bank of Commerce.The J.P.Morgan firm has effectively controlled Guaranty Trust since 1912 when Mrs.Edward Harriman (mother of Roland and Averell Harriman) sold her block of 8,OoO shares of the total outstanding 20,000 shares to J.P.Morgan.By 1954 Guaranty Trust had become the most important banking subsidiary of the J.P.Morgan firm and since 1954 the merged firms have been known as Morgan-Guaranty Company. Harry Payne Whitney (The Order’94) inherited two Standard Oil fortunes from the Payne and the Whitney families.H.P.Whitney was a director of Guaranty Trust,as was his father,Wiliam C.Whitney (The Order ’63).Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (The Order ’99) represented the Vanderbilt family until he drowned at sea in the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. (His sister Gertrude married Harry Payne Whitney,above). The power of The Order is reflected in a bizarre incident as Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt boarded the Lusitania in New York on its fateful voyage.A telegram warning Vanderbilt not to sail was delivered to the Lusitania before it sailed - but never reached Vanderbilt.Consequently, Vanderbilt went down with the ship. In brief, The Order was closely associated with Guaranty Trust and Morgan-Guaranty long before 1912 when Mrs.Edward Harriman sold her interest to J.P.Morgan.Averell Harriman remained on the Board of Guaranty Trust after the transfer.The following members of The Order have also been officers and directors of Guaranty Trust Company: Harold Stanley (The Order 1908):Harold Stanley,born 1885,was the son of William Stanley,an inventor associated with General Electric Company.Stanley prepared for Yale University at the elitist Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut.An excellent athlete, Stanley graduated Yale in 1908 and was initiated into The Order. After Yale,Stanley joined National Bank of Albany and then，between 1913-1915,was with J.G.White (prominent in construction of the Soviet First Five Year Plan). In 1915 Stanley joined Guaranty Trust as Vice President. From 1921 to 1928 he was President of Guaranty Trust and then a partner in the firm of J.P.Morgan,replacing William Morrow.From 1935 to 1941 he was President of Morgan,Stanley & Company, then a partner from 1941 to 1955 and a limited partner after 1956,until his death in 1963.

MacVeagh himself,as distinct from Brush, is a little difficult to classify. In 1913 MacVeagh left the Treasury and resigned as trustee of the University of Chicago.By 1919 he had become delinquent in his fees to Russell Trust. We have a copy of a dunning notice sent to MacVeagh by Otto Bannard (The Order ’76)，President of New York Life and Treasurer for The Order in 1919. The notice asked MacVeagh to pay up his dues. While the trail of MacVeagh fades out after 1913,that of Matthew Brush，his one-time clerk，blossoms forth．After a series of posts in railroad companies,Brush was made Vice President of American International Corporation in 1918 and President in 1923.He was also Chairman of the Equitable Office Building,also known as 120 Broadway,illustrated on page 139. The purpose of this memorandum has been to demonstrate control of two banking houses by members of The Order.Both Guaranty Trust and Brown Brothers，Harriman can truly be said to have been dominated and substantially owned by individuals identified as members.Furthermore，both Guaranty Trust and the original W.A. Harriman Company were established by members of The Order. Brown Brothers was not absorbed until 1933. In an earlier book,published in 1974,we presented major evidence of Wall Street assistance for the Bolshevik Revolution. This assistance was mainly cash,guns and ammunition,and diplomatic support in London and Washington，D.C.Wall Street And The Bolsheuik Revolution aiso introduced the concept which Quigley described,i.e.， that Morgan and other financial interests financed and influenced all parties from left to right in the political spectrum.

So long as there is no open break, it will probably be impossible to entirely prevent such commerce.Steps should therefore be taken to impede，so far as possible，the transport of grain and raw materials to Germany from Russia.”1 When President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops to hold the Trans-Siberian railroad, secret instructions were given by Woodrow Wilson in person to General William S. Graves.We have not yet located these instructions (although we know they exist)，but a close reading of the available files shows that American intervention had little to do with anti-Bolshevik activity,as the Soviets,George Kennan and other writers maintain.

So far as aiding the Soviet Army is concerned，there are State Department records that show guns and ammunition were shipped to the Bolsheviks.And in 1919,while Trotsky was making anti-American speeches in public，he was also asking Ambassador Francis for American military inspection teams to train the new Soviet Army.1 However,it was in Washington and London that The Order really aided the Soviets. The Order succeeded not only in preventing military actions against the Bolsheviks,but to so-muddy the policy waters that much needed vital raw materials and goods,ultimately even loans, were able to flow from the United States to the Soviets,in spite of a legal ban. This will introduce to you my friend,Professor Evans Clark,now associated with the Bureau of Information of the Russian Soviet Republic.He wants to talk with you about the recognition of Wolchak,the raising of the blockade,etc.,and get your advice in regard to backing up the senators who would be apt to stand up and make a brave fight.Won’t you do what you can for him.

One of the most sinister things at present is the fact that governments are going into the advertising business.They are organized so that they can make or wreck movements.Iam sending you,under separate cover,a copy of a letter I have written,which I hope will interest you. The above letter is from Amos Pinchot (The Order ’97). His brother, conservationist Gifford Pinchot (The Order ’89) was also a member. Amos Pinchot was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union and active in aiding the Soviets during the early days of the Bolshevik Revolution.The above letter,exemplifying this assstance,was sent to Santeri Nourteva,November 22,19i8,just a year after the 1917 Revolution.Pinchot was heartily sympathetic with your view of the situation and the work you are doing.\"1 Who was Nourteva? This name was an alias for Alexander Nyberg,a Soviet representative in the United States.

Nyberg’s assistant was Kenneth Durant, an American newspaper man, later TASS correspondent in the U.S.and one time aide to “Colonel” Edward House, mystery man of the Wilson Administration.Director of the Commercial Department in this Soviet Bureau was “Comrade Evans Clark.” Clark later became Executive Director of the influential Twentieth Century Foundation,and at Twentieth Century Foundation we find a member of The Order - in this case Charles Phelps Taft (The Order ’18), nephew of President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft. In the coming volume on FOUNDATIONS,we shall see how Evans Clark and The Order,working together at Twentieth Century Foundation, had a significant role in the Hegelization of American education. For assistance Evans Clark turned to The Order. On May 29,1919, Amos Pinchot wrote fellow Skull & Bones member and strong Republican Wiliam Kent about raising the blockade against the Soviets. William Kent (The Order ’87) was on the U.S.TariffCommission and in turn wrote Senator Lenroot to request an interview for “Professor” Evans Clark. (Albert Kent,his father,was a member [The Order‘53] and he married the daughter of Thomas Thacher [The Order’35].

The immediate problem facing the Soviets was to restore silent Russian factories. This needed raw materials, technical skills and working capital. The key to Russian reconstruction was the oil fields of the Caucasus.The Caucasus oil fields are a major segment of Russian natural resource wealth.Baku, the most important field,was developed in the 187Os.

In 1900 it was producing more crude oil than the United States,and in 1901 more than half of the total world crude output. The Caucasus oil fields survived Revolution and Intervention without major structural damage and became a significant factor in Soviet economic recovery, generating about 2O percent of allexports by value; the largest single source of foreign exchange. The Bolsheviks took over the Caucasus in 1920-1,but until 1923 oil field drilling almost ceased.During the first year of Soviet rule“…not one single new well has started giving oil”1 and even two years after Soviet occupation,no new oil-field properties had been developed. In addition,deepening of old wells virtually ceased.As a result,water percolated into the wells,and the flow of crude oil became a mixture of oil and water.Drilling records are an excellent indicator of the state of oil field maintenance,development,and production.The complete collapse after the Soviet takeover is clearly suggested by the statistics. In 1900，Russia had been the world’s largest producer and exporter of crude oil; almost 5O,OoO feet of drilling per month had been required in Baku alone to maintain this production. By early 1921, the average monthly drilling in Baku had declined to an insignificant 37O feet or so (0.7 percent of the 1900 rate),although 162 rigs were in working order. Then，Serebrovsky,Chairman of Azneft (the Soviet oil production trust),put forward a program for recovery in a Pravda article.The plan for 1923 was to increase oil well drilling to 35,Oo0 sazhens per year (245,00O feet). This would require 35 rotary drills (to drill 77,000 feet) and 157 percussion drills (to drill 130,000 feet).Serebrovsky pointed out that Azneft had no rotary drills,and that Russian enterprise could not supply them. Rotary drilling, however,was essential for the success of the plan. “But just here American capital is going to support us.The American firm International Barnsdall Corporation has submitted a plan .. . Lack of equipment prevents us from increasing the production of the oil industry of Baku by ourselves.The American firm…will provide the equipment,start drilling in the oil fields and organize the technical production of oil with deep pumps.”1 During the next few years International Barnsdall, together with the Lucey Manufacturing Company and other major foreign oil well equipment firms,fulfilled Serebrovsky’s program.Massive imports of equipment came from the United States. International Barnsdall inaugurated the rotary drilling program, initiated Azneft drilling crews into its operational problems,and reorganized oil well pumping with deep well electrical pumps.

The U.S. State Department Archives contain an intriguing quotation from Rykov,dated October 1922: Guaranty Trust，Lee,，Higginson Company and W.A.Harriman owned Barnsdall Corporation,and International Barnsdall Corporation was owned 75% by the Barnsdall Corporation and 25% by H.Mason Day. The Guaranty Trust interest was represented by Eugene W. Stet-son (also a Vice President of Guaranty Trust)，whose son, Eugene W. Stetson Jr.，was initiated into The Order in 1934. The Lee Higginson interest was represented by Frederick Winthrop Allen (The Order ₀₀ The second potentially largest source of Soviet foreign exchange in the 192Os was the large Russian manganese deposits. In 1913,tsarist Russia supplied 52 percent of world manganese,of which about 76 percent,or one million tons,was mined from the Chiaturi deposits in the Caucasus.Production in 1920 was zero,and by 1924 had risen only to about 320,000 tons per year.The basic problem was: The Chiaturi deposits, situated on high plateaus some distance from Batum,were mined in a primitive manner,and the ore was brought on donkeys from the plateaus to the railroads.There was a change of gauge en route,and the manganese had to be transshipped between the original loading point and the port.When at the port, the ore was transferred by bucket:a slow,expensive process. Under the Harriman concession agreement, $4 million was spent on mechanizing the mines and converting them from hand to mechanical operation.A washer and reduction plant were built; and a loading elevator at Poti, with a two-million ton capacity and a railroad system were constructed, together with an aerial tramway for the transfer of manganese ore.The expenditure was approximately $2 million for the railroad system and $1 million for mechanization of the mines.

Secondly，the Harriman-Guaranty syndicate,which reflected The Order，did not inform the State Department of its plans.As the attached letter (page 152) from Washington to the London Embassy describes,the first information of the Harriman manganese deposit came from the American Embassy in London,which picked it up from London newspaper reports. Now we reach the truly exraordinary point. The U.S.Government was not informed by W.A.Harriman or Guaranty Trust that they intended to invest $4 million developing Soviet manganese deposits. Yet this was clearly illegal and a move with obvious strategic consequences for the U.S. Neither was the U.S. Government able to pick up this information elsewhere；in those days there was no CIA.Economic intelligence was handled by the State Department. It is also obvious that Government officials were interested in acquiring information,as they should have been. We reproduce on page 155 a memorandum from Evan E. Young in Division of Eastern European Affairs to Assistant Secretary of State Carr. Note this is a memorandum at the upper levels of the State Department.Young specifically writes:“… there are certain and very definite reasons why I consider it very unwise for the Department to initiate any investigation with respect to the reported manganese concession.” “There is & board consisting of five membcra and five active direotorg.

The Order kept a hold on every non-government strategic position related to the Soviet Union. Nothing appears to have escaped their attention.For example,the Anglo-Russian Chamber of Commerce was created in 1920 to promote trade with Russia - desperately needed by the Soviets to restore idle Tsarist industry.The Chairman of its Executive Committee, the key post in the Chamber,was held by Samuel R.Bertron (The Order ’85),a Vice President of Guaranty Trust and formerly a member of the 1917 Root Mission to Russia.Elihu Root, Chairman of the Mission，was,of course，the personal attorney to William Collins Whitney (The Order ^( ′63) ),one of the key members of The Order.The letter from Bertron’s Anglo-Russian Chamber of Commerce to State Department, printed on page 158 is noteworthy because it asks the question: “What date trading in Russian credits was prohibited in the United States by Federal authorities?” This means that The Order was well aware in 1921 that “credits” to the U.S.S.R.were illegal and indeed were not made legal until President Roosevelt took office in 1933.However, illegal or not,within 18 months of this Bertron letter，Guaranty Trust established more than trading in Russian credits.Guaranty Trust made a joint banking agreement with the Soviets and installed a Guaranty Trust Vice President, Max May，as director in charge of the foreign division of this Soviet bank,the RUSKOMBANK (See document on page 157). In brief,while the U.S.public was being assured by the U.S.Government that the Soviets were dastardly murderers,while“Reds” were be-ing deported back to Russia by the Department of Justice,while every politician (almost without exception) was assuring the American public that the United States would have no relations with the Soviets - while this barrage of lies was aimed at a gullible public,behind the scenes the Guaranty Trust Company was actually running a division of a Soviet bank!

Take the example of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett which in the 1920s was located at 120 Broadway， New York. The firm was founded by Thomas Thacher (The Order ‘71) in 1884.His son Thomas Day Thacher (The Order ^(∘)04 )worked for the family law firm after leaving Yale and initiation into The Order. The younger Thomas Thacher went to work for Henry L. Stimson (The Order ’88),a very active member of The Order discussed in Volume One of this series. About this time Thacher, who wrote The Order’s statement on the Bolshevik Revolution (page 138),became friendly with both Felix Frankfurter and Raymond Robins. According to extensive documentation in the Lusk Commitee files,both Frankfurter and Robins were of considerable assistance to the Soviets. Furthermore,readers of Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution will recall that member Samuel Bertron was on the Root Mission to Russia in 1917.Moreover，Thomas Thacher (The Order ?04^(′) wasa member of the Red Cross Mission with Allan Wardwell,son of Thomas Wardwell, Standard Oil Treasurer and a partner in another Wall Street law firm,Statson,Jennings& Russell (the links of this firm to The Order will be described in a later volume).Eugene Stetson,Jr.,for example, is in The Order (’34). For example,in 1927 Simpson，Thacher & Bartlett informed the U.S.Government that the Soviets were in the process of substantially increasing deposits in the U.S. This increase was in preparation for the enormous outlays to be channeled to a few favored U.S.firms to build the Soviet First Five Year Plan.

Note,for example,the last paragraph:“…it seems to us there is no reason why the Bank should not so increase its deposits notwithstanding our Government has not recognized the U.S.S.R.” During the past four years the Government of the United States has maintained the position that it would be both futile and unwise to enter into relations with the Soviet Government so long as the Bolshevik leaders persist in aims and practices in the field of international relations which preclude the possibility of establishing relations on the basis of accepted principles governing intercourse between nations.It is the conviction of the Government of the United States that relations on a basis usual between friendly nations can not be established with a governmental entity which is the agency of a group who hold it as their mission to bring about the overthrow of the existing political,economic and social order throughout the world and who regulate their conduct towards other nations accordingly. The experiences of uarious European Governments which have recognized and entered into relations with the Soviet regime have demonstrated conclusively the wisdom of the policy to which the Government of the United States has consistently adhered.Recognition ofthe Soviet regime has not brought about any cessation of interference by the Bolsheuik leaders in the internal affairs of any recognizing country，nor has it led to the acceptance by them of other fundamental obligations of international intercourse.Certain European states have endeavored,by entering into discussions with representatives of the Soviet regime,to reach a settlement of outstanding differences on the basis of accepted international practices.Such conferences and discussions have been entirely fruitless.No state has been able to obtain the payment of debts contracted by Russia under preceding governments or the indemnification of its citizens forconfiscated property.Indeed,there is every reason to believe that the granting of recognition and the holding of discussions have served only to encourage the present rulers of Russia in their policy of repudiation and confiscation,as well as in their hope that it is possible to establish a working basis,accepted by other nations,whereby they can continue their war on the existing political and social order in other countries. Current developments demonstrate the continued persistence at Moscow of a dominating world revolutionary purpose and the practical manifestation of this purpose in such ways as render impossible the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet government.

Construction of the Soviet dialectic arm continued throughout the 1930s up to World War II. In 1941 W.A. Harriman was appointed Lend Lease Administrator to assure the flow of United States technology and products to the Soviet Union.Examination of.Lend Lease records shows that U.S. law was violated. The law required military goods only to be shipped. In fact, industrial equipment in extraordinary amounts was also shipped and Treasury Department currency plates so that the Soviets could freely print U.S.dollars. The Marxist version of the Hegelian dialectic poses financial capitalism as thesis and Marxist revolution as antithesis.An obvious puzzle in this Marxian statement is the nature of the synthesis presumed to evolve out of the clash of these opposites,i.e.,the clash of financial capitalism and revolutionary Marxism. Lenin’s statement that the State will wither away at the synthesis stage is nonsensical. In fact,as all contemporary Marxist states testify,the State in practice becomes all powerful.The immediate task of“the revolution”is to convey all power to the state，and modern Marxist states operate under a constant paranoia that power may indeed pass away from the hands of the State into the hands of the people. We suggest that world forces may be seen differently,although still in terms of the Hegelian dialectic.If Marxism is posed as the thesis and national socialism as antithesis,then the most likely synthesis becomes a Hegelian New World Order,a synthesis evolving out of the clash of Marxism and national socialism.Moreover, in this statement those who finance and manage the clash of opposites can remain in control of the synthesis. In Wall Street And The Rise of Hitler we described several financial conduits between Wall Street and the Nazi Party. This was later supplemented by publication of a long suppressed book,Hitler’s Secret Backers.1 Still other books have emphasized the Fritz Thyssen financial connection to Hitler.After he split with Hitler,Thyssen himself wrote a book,I Paid Hitler.We are now in a position to merge the evidence in these books with other material and our documentation on The Order.

The document reproduced on page 167 slipped through U.S.censorship because the Office of Director of Intelligence did not know of the link between Fritz Thyssen and the Harriman interests in New York. Documents linking Wall Street to Hitler have for the most part been removed from U.S.Control Council records. In any event,，we reproduce here the Intelligence report identifying Fritz Thyssen and his Bank fur Handel und Schiff (No.EF/Me/1 of September 4,1945) and page13 of the interrogation of Fritz Thyssen entitled “Financial Support of the Nazi Party.” Fritz Thyssen was the German steel magnate who associated himself with the Nazi movement in the early ’2Os.When interrogated in 1945 under Project Dustbin，Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by General Ludendorf at the time of French evacuation of the Ruhr. Shortly after this meeting Thyssen was introduced to Hitler and provided funds for the Nazis through General Ludendorf. In 1930-31 Emil Kirdorf approached Thyssen and subsequently sent Rudolf Hess to negotiate further funding for the Nazi Party.This time Thyssen arranged a credit of 250,OOO marks at the Bank Voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. (the Dutch name for the bank named by Thyssen in the attached document),at 18 Zuidblaak in Rotterdam,Holland. y first connection rich the Yeimrty wes through General LuD,oRF, follotinthe evacuation or lhe Ruhr bytincn roops.He told me aout the Party enc asked for iy help.I agrecd,but I did not vant to give any money directlyto the Perty，soI gave it toLuDivoRF cnd he gaveii tothe Party.

In reward for his efforts，Thyssen was showered with political and economic favors by the Third Reich and enjoyed almost unlimited power and prestige under the Nazi regime until his break with Hitler in 1939 over the decision to invade Poland and precipitate the Second World War. This incident and Thyssen’s subsequent publication,I Paid Hitler,has a parallel wtih the history of his father,August Thyssen．Through a similar confession in 1918 the elder Thyssen,despite his record as a staunch backer of pan-Germanism,succeeded in convincing the Allies that sole responsibility for German aggression should be placed on the Kaiser and German industrialists should not be blamed for the support they had given to the Hohenzollerns.Apparently influenced by August Thyssen and his associates,the Allies made no effort to reform German industry after World War I. The result was that Thyssen was allowed to retain a vast industrial empire and pass it on intact to his heirs and successors. It was against this background that Fritz Thyssen took over control of the family holdings following the death of his father in 1926.The new German steel baron had already achieved fame throughout the Reich by his defiance of the French during their occupation of the Ruhr in 1923.Like Hitler,Thyssen regarded the Treaty of Versailles as“a pact of shame”which must be overthrown if the Fatherland were to rise again This is the story in Hitler’s Secret Backers.

Thyssen set out along the same road as his father,aided by ample Wall Street loans to build German industry. August Thyssen had combined with Hugenburg,Kirdorf,and the elder Krupp to promote the All-Deutscher Verband (the Pan-German League),which supplied the rationale for the Kaiser’s expansionist policies. During the next 2 years Thyssen dedicated his fortune and his influence to bring Hitler to power. In 1932 he arranged the famous meeting in the Dusseldorf Industrialists’ Club,at which Hitler addressed the leading businessmen of the Ruhr and the Rhineland.At the close of Hitler’s speech Thyssen cried,“Heil Herr Hitler,”while the others applauded enthusiastically.By the time of the German Presidential elections later that year,Thyssen obtained contributions to Hitler’s cam-paign fund from the industrial combines. He alone is reported to have spent 3,000,000 marks on the Nazis in the year 1932. This flow of funds went through Thyssen banks.The Bank fur Handel and Schiff cited as the conduit in the U.S.Intelligence report was a subsidiary of the August Thyssen Bank,and founded in i918 with H.J. Kouwenhoven and D.C. Schutte as managing partners. In brief,it was Thyssen’s personal banking operation,and affiliated with the W.A. Harriman financial interests in New York. Thyssen reported to his Project Dustbin interrogators that: E.Roland Harriman Vice President of W.A.Harriman & (The Order 1917) Co.,New York H.J.Kouwenhoven Nazi banker,managing partner of (Nazi) August Thyssen Bank and Bank voor Handel Scheepvaart N.V.

This “blood trade” is by no means sporadic or limited to a few firms; it is general and reflects higher policy decisions and philosophies. Corporations - even large corporations - are dominated by banks and trust companies，and in turn these banks and trust companies are dominated by The Order and its alies. (This willbe the topic of a forthcoming volume). Although the U.S. did not officially go to war with Germany until 1941,legally,and certainly morally,the U.S. was at war with Nazi Germany after the Destroyer deal with Great Britain in December 1940, i.e., the exchange of 50 old U.S. destroyers for strategic bases in British territory.Even before December 194O the MS“Frederick S.Fales” owned by Standard Vacuum Company was sunk by a German submarine on September 21，1940.Yet in 1941 Standard Oil of New Jersey (now EXXON) had six Standard Oil tankers under Panamanian registry，manned by Nazi officers to carry fuel oil from Standard Oil refineries to the Canary Islands,a refueling base of Nazi submarines. Yet another example is that of Chase Bank.Chase was linked to The Order through the Rockefeller family (Percy Rockefeller，The Order 1900)and Vice-President Reeve Schley (Yale,Scroll & Key).Directors of Chase in The Order included Frederick Allen (The Order 1900), W.E.S.Griswold (The Order 1899) and Cornelius Vanderbilt,whose brother Gwynne Vanderbilt (The Order 1899) represented the family before his death.President of Chase was Winthrop Aldrich.This was the Harvard branch of the Aldrich family,another branch is Yale and The Order. 1.

Indeed there is ample evidence to show that the Head Office in New York viewed Niederman’s good relations with the Germans as an excellent means of preserving,unimpaired, the position of the Chase Bank in France. c. The German authorities were anxious to keep the Chase open and indeed took exceptional measures to provide sources of revenue. d.The German authorities desired “to be friends” with the important American banks because they expected that these banks would be useful after the war as an instrument of German policy in the United States. e.The Chase，Paris showed itself most anxious to please the German authorities in every possible way.For example,the Chase zealously maintained the account of the German Embassy in Paris,“as every little thing helps” (to maintain the excellent relations between Chase and the German authorities). f.The whole objective of the Chase policy and operation was to maintain the position of the bank at any cost.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:80:0f1b8165052e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4535, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "these banks would be useful after the war as an instrument of German policy in the United States. e.The Chase，Paris showed itself most anxious to please the German authorities in every possible way.For example,the Chase zealously maintained the account of the German Embassy in Paris,“as every little thing helps” (to maintain the excellent relations between Chase and the German authorities). f.The whole objective of the Chase policy and operation was to maintain the position of the bank at any cost. On the other hand,Chase Bank, later Chase Manhattan Bank,has been a prime promoter of exporting U.S.technology to the Soviet Union. This goes allthe way back to the early 1920s when Chase broke U.S. regulations in order to aid the Soviets. As early as 1922 Chase was trying to export military LIBERTY aircraft engines to the Soviet Union! In conclusion,we have seen that the two arms of the dialectic described in Memoranda Three and Four clashed in World War II.Fur-thermore,the corporate segment of the elite profited from Lend Lease to the Soviets and by underground cooperation with Nazi interests. The political wing of The Order was at the same time preparing a new dialectic for the post World War Il era. World War II was the culmination of the dialectic process created in the 192Os and 1930s.The clash between “left’and “right,”i.e.，the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany， led to creation of a synthesis - notably the United Nations,and a start towards regional groupings in the Common Market,COMECON，NATO，UNESCO，Warsaw Pact, SEATO,CENTO,and then the Trilateral Commission.A start towards New World Order. The source of the current process may be found in National Security Memorandum No.68 of 1950,with its extraordinary omissions (analyzed in The Phoenix Letter, January 1984).NSC 68 opened up the road for Western technology to build a more advanced Soviet Union 一 which it did in the 1960s and 1970s with computerized space-age technology.At the same time NSC 68 presented the argument for massive expansion of U.S.defenses - on the grounds of a future Soviet threat. The omission in NSC 68 was quite elementary,i.e., that the Soviets could not progress without Western technology. NSC 68 allowed that technology transfer to go on. In other words,by allowing Western firms to expand the Soviet Union，NSC-68 also pari passu created the argument for a U.S. defense budget. We identified in our Phoenix Letter article the link between NSC-68 and The Order. Unfortunately for The Order,but not surprisingly,given their limited perception of the world,the dialectic plan based on NSC-68 misfired. The principal devices used to control the dialectic process in the past two decades have been (a) information， (b) debt and (c) technology. These have become diluted over time. They just don’t work as well today as they did in the 1950s. By and large,control of information has been successful.

The intellec-tual world is still locked into a phony verbal battle between “left” and “right,” whereas the real struggle is the battle between individual freedom and the encroaching power of the absolute State. The Soviet Union，with its tight censorship，presents a strictly Marxist (i.e.,“left”) orientation to its citizens.The enemy is always the “fascist’United States.The West is a little more complicated but not much more so. Quigley’s argument in Tragedy And Hope，that J.P.Morgan used financial power to control politics,has been extended to The Order’s control of information.In the West the choice is basically between a controlled “left-oriented’ information and a controlled“right-oriented” information.1 The conflict between the two controlled groups keeps an apparent informational conflict alive. Unwelcome facts that fall into neither camp are conveniently forgotten.Books that fall into neither camp can be effectively neutralized because they will incur the wrath of both“right”and“left”. The dialectic plan therefore misfired for several reasons.Firstly,the informational blackout has not been as successful as The Order expected.We shall describe later how control of Time and Newsweek gave The Order dominance over weekly news summaries.The TV networks have been able to orchestrate viewer reactions - to some extent. For example,the three ABC blockbusters in 1983 were The Day After, Thornbirds,and Winds Of War,all with a common propaganda theme. But The Order was unable to restrict individuals and relatively small non-academic groups,almost always outside Universities,from exploring obvious inconsistencies in establishment propaganda. These groups often mistakenly termed “left” or “right” are outside the generally manipulated left-right spectrum. Second,the construction of a completely new arm，that of Communist China，itself Marxist，but with conflict potential for the Soviet Union. Major efforts by The Order are in progress,only partly revealed in the press, to create a new superpower in a conflict mode with the Soviet Union.This is the new antithesis,replacing Nazi Germany. This view cannot be supported. If the Portuguese were colonists in Angola, then so are the Boston Brahmins in Massachusetts. Luanda, the chief town in Angola，was settled by the Portuguese in 1575 − that’s half a century before the Pilgrims landed in Massachusetts. The indigenous population of Angola in 1575 was less than the Indian popula-tion of Massachusetts. Over three centuries the Portuguese treated Angola more as a province than as a colony,in contrast to British, French and Belgian colonial rule in Africa. So if Angola belonged to non-existent indigenous natives，then so does Massachusetts logically belong to American Indians. In the early 196Os the United States was actively aiding the Marxist cause in Angola.

So if Angola belonged to non-existent indigenous natives，then so does Massachusetts logically belong to American Indians. In the early 196Os the United States was actively aiding the Marxist cause in Angola. This is clear from former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. The following extracts are from a memorandum recording a conversation between Dean Acheson (Scroll& Key), McGeorge Bundy (The Order ′40 ),and President Kennedy dated April 2,1962: “He [Kennedy] then turned to the negotiations with Portugal over the Azores base. He said that not much seemed to be happening and that he would be grateful to have me take the matter over and see if something could be done. I asked him for permission to talk about the situation for a few minutes and said about the following: “The Portuguese were deeply offended at what they believed was the desertion of them by the United States, if not the actual alignment of the United States with their enemies.The problem,it seemed to me, lay not so much in negotiations with the Portuguese as in the determination of United States policy.The battle would be in Washington,rather than in Lisbon.’ “The President then asked me why I was so sure that there was no room for negotiations under the present conditions. I said that, as he perhaps knew，we had in fact been subsidizing Portugal’s enemies；and that they strongly suspected this，although they could not prove it. He said that the purpose of this was to try to keep the Angolan nationalist movement out of the hands of the communist Ghanians,etc.，and keep it in the most moderate hands possible. I said that I quite understood this,but that it did not make what the Portuguese suspected any more palatable to them.We were also engaged in smuggling Angolese out of Angola and educating them in Lincoln College outside of Philadelphia in the most extreme nationalist views. Furthermore the head of this college had secretly and illegally entered Angola and on his return had engaged in violent anti-Portuguese propaganda.We voted in the United Nations for resolutions“condemning” Portugal for maintaining order in territory unquestionably under Portuguese sovereignty. I pointed out that the Portuguese were a proud people，especially sensitive because they had declined to such animpotent position after such a glorious history. They would rather proceed to the ruin of their empire in a dignified way,as they had in Goa,than be bought or wheedled into cooperating in their own destruction.\" There is an extremely important, although seemingly minor,point in President Kennedy’s comments.

Kennedy apparently believed the U.S. was financing Nationalists,not Marxists, whereas the U.S. was actually aiding Marxists,as it was later to do in South Africa, following a pattern going back to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. There is a point well worth following up in the Kennedy files,i.e., just how much Kennedy knew about CIA and State Department operations,where The Order was in control. Back in 1975 the U.S. in conjunction with South Africa did indeed make a military drive into Angola. At a crucial point，when South African forces could have reached Launda, the United States caled off assistance. South Africa had no choice but to retreat. South Africa learned the hard way that the U.S. is only nominally anti-Marxist. In practice the U.S. did to South Africa what it had done many times before - the elite betrayed its anti-Marxist allies. By the early 1980s The Order’s multinational friends came out of the woodwork while carefully coordinating public actions with Vice President Bush (The Order 1948).For example,in March 27,1981 The Wall Street Journal ran a revealing article,including some nuggets of reality mingled with the Establishment line.This front page article viewed U.S. multinational support for the Angolan Marxists under the headline “Friendly Foe:companies urge U.S. to stay out of Angola, decline aid to rebels” (these rebels being anti-Marxist Savimbi’s UNITA forcesaided by South Africa). The leader of the pro-Marxist corporate forces in the U.S. is Melvin J. Hill,President of Gulf Oil Exploration&Production Company,aunit of Gulf Oil which operates Gulf Cabinda.This is arefinery complex in Angola，protected from Savimbi’s pro-Western rebels by Cubans and Angolan Marxist troops. Hilltold the WSJ “Angola is a knowledgeable, understanding and reliable business partner.” Hill not only appeared before Congress with this pro-Marxist line,but met at least several times with then Vice President Bush. Hill and Wood, of course,are no more than public relations agents for Marxist Angola,although we understand they have not registered as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. Angola is very much a Cuban-Soviet base for the take-over of Southern Africa,yet 17 western oil companies and other firms are in Angola. They include Gulf,Texaco,Petrofina,Mobil, Cities Service,Marathon Oil and Union Texas Petroleum.Other firms include Allied Chemical, Boeing Aircraft, General Electric - and Bechtel Corporation. It should be remembered that both Secretary of State Schultz and Secretary of Defense Weinberger are on loan from Bechtel Corporation. The next largest shareholder is the Mellon Family comprising the Andrew W.Mellon Foundation,the Richard King Foundation,and the Sarah Scaife Foundation.

This group,which thinks of itself as con-servative,\" holds about 7 percent of the outstanding shares.Morgan Guaranty Trust (a name we have encountered before) holds 1.8 million shares or about 1 percent of the outstanding shares. To a great extent these corporations with Angolan interests have themselves out on a limb. It is surprising,for example,that South Africa has not moved to take counter action against Angolan based firms, especially General Electric, Boeing,Morgan Guaranty Trust,Gulf Oil and Cities Service.After all,the South Africans are directly losing men from the massive support given to the Angolan Marxists by these firms. After U.S.betrayal of South Africa in 1975,when South African forces could have reached Luanda, it is a tribute to South Africa’s cau tion that it has not used this rather obvious counter weapon. After all,a South African surgical strike on Cabinda would neatly remove the Angolans’ largest single source of foreign exchange,and give multinational Marxists a little food for thought.We are not,of course,recommending any such action,but it does remain an option open to South Africa.And the possible U.S.reaction? Well the State Department and CIA had best be ready with an explanation for the U.S.Embassy plane caught photographing South African military installations! In 1971 Mr. Nixon appointed George“Poppy”Bush (The Order 1948) as U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations,irrespective of the fact that Bush had no previous experience in diplomacy. As chief U.S. delegate,Bush had responsibility for defense against the Communist Chinese attack on the Republic of China,an original free enterprise member of the United Nations.With the vast power of the United States at his disposal,Bush failed miserably: the Republic was expelled from United Nations and Communist China took its seat. Shortly after that fiasco，Bush left United Nations to take over as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. During World War II the United States helped the Chinese Communists into power.As one Chinese authority,Chin-tung Liang,has written about General Joseph W. Stilwell, the key U.S. representative in China from 1942 to 1944:“From the viewpoint of the struggle against Communism…[Stilwell] did a great disservice to China.”1 But when we get to General Marshall we need to remember that in the U.S. the civilian branch has final authority in matters military and that gets us to then Secretary of War Henry L.Stimson，Marshall’s superior and a member of The Order (1888).By an amazing coincidence,Stimson was also Secretary of War in 1911 - at the time of the Sun Yat Sen revolution.

The story of the betrayal of China and the role of The Order will have to await yet another volume.At this time we want only to record the decision to build Communist China as a new arm of the dialectic 一 a decision made under President Richard Nixon and placed into operation by Henry Kissinger (Chase Manhattan Bank) and George“Poppy” Bush (The Order). As we go to press (early 1984) Bechtel Corporation has established a new company,Bechtel China, Inc.,to handle development,engineering and construction contracts for the Chinese government. The new President of Bechtel China, Inc.is Sydney B.Ford, formerly marketing manager of Bechtel Civil & Minerals,Inc.Currently Bechtel is working on studies for the China National Coal Development Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation - both,of course, Chinese Communist organizations. There is no doubt Bechtel willdo its job.Former CIA Director Richard Helms works for Bechtel, so did Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. That’s a powerful,influential combination，if any Washington planner concerned with national security gets out of line sufficiently to protest. Yet，The Order has probably again miscalculated.What will be Moscow’s reaction to this dialectic challenge? Even without traditional Russian paranoia they can be excused for feeling more than a little uneasy.And who is to say that the Chinese Communists will not make their peace with Moscow after 2OoO and join forces to eliminate the super-super-power - the United States? In brief, secrecy in matters political is historically associated with coercion.Furthermore,the existence of secrecy in organizations with political ambitions or with a history of political action is always suspect. Freedom is always associated with open political action and discussion while coercion is always associated with secrecy. There are numerous historical examples to support this premise. Back in the late 17th century the Elector of Bavaria, the constitutional government of Bavaria, banned the Iluminati organization.Accidental discovery of Iluminati documents demonstrated that a secret organization was devoted to the overthrow of the Bavarian state and establishment of a world society run by elitist Illuminati. More recently in England there have been startling discoveries involving use of the masonic movement by the Soviet KGB to subvert and infiltrate British intelligence.True freemasonry is an establishment conservative organization,but its organizational structure can be - and has been - used for revolutionary purposes.

In England at any rate freemasonry has become a self-serving organization always discriminating in favor of its own members when it comes to contracts, jobs,careers and promotions.Moreover，we now know that the masonic movement in England was used by the Russian KGB to infiltrate， take over and finally head British intelligence organizations. · “They (the senior societies at Yale) are the only Yale societies whose transactions are truly secret.” ·“Their members never mention their names, nor refer to them in any way in the presence of anyone not of their own number, and as they are all seniors,there are no old members in the class above them to tell tales out of school.” This series of books is based on several sources，including contemporary “moles.”However, information on the cultic aspects comes from a century-old Yale concern about the operations and intentions of Skull & Bones. This concern generated two pamphlets, one issue of a journal and a chapter in a book,as follows: This is reference to a break-in by a group of Yale students,and the pamphlet describes in minute detail the contents of the Temple.For example,it describes the walls,e.g.，“… the walls are adorned with pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale and of the members of the Society in Germany when the Chapter was established here in 1832.” “Bones is a chapter of a corps in a German University. It should properly be called,not Skull & Bones Society but Skull & Bones Chapter. General R—– (Russell)，,its founder，was in Germany before Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society.He brought back with him to college,authority to found a chapter here.Thus was Bones founded.” Only one issue of this journal has been found,and only a single copy of that issue exists. It is reproduced as an appendix below.The editor of The Iconoclast considered Skull & Bones“a deadly evil’and emphasized their interest in political control. Moreover，the Iconoclast states that The Order obtained control of Yale,and its members care more for their society than for Yale: This “recruiting ground” interpretation suggests several points.Firstly，the documentary evidence is quite clear: Knights,i.e.，the just recruited initiates,spend only one year as Knights. They become Patriarchs after leaving Yale and spend a lifetime as Patriarchs.Second, continual correspondence and meeting as Patriarchs continues after leaving Yale.In fact， the Deer lland Club is specifically for annual meetings of Patriarchs and the Russell Trust Association is run entirely by Patriarchs.

Similarly,New Solidarity,i.e., the Lyndon LaRouche outfit,claims to have exposed The Order back in 1979.Unfortunately,neither Lyndon LaRouche nor anyone else can produce documents dated 1983 and 1984 in 1979.In any event, the degree of documentation in our volumes on The Order has not been matched elsewhere. The answer is that this author does have - and fully admits to having - clandestine sources within The Order. We understand that for specific reasons these sources are not available to either JBS or Lyndon LaRouche.At that point we will leave our discussion of sources and move on to the ritual aspects of The Order. The Yale Senior society system is unique to Yale University. There is nothing like it elsewhere in the United States or for that matter in the entire world.According to Lyman Bagg in Four Years at Yale,“the senior societies are such peculiarly Yale institutions that it willbe difficult for an outsider fully to appreciate their significance” (Bagg，p.142,see page following for full context). Nothing like them exists elsewhere and according to Bagg,“Harvard is the only college where,under similar conditions they possibly could exist.” Skull& Bones was founded in 1933 and has initiated 15 members each year since 1933 (except for 1945 when only 10 were tapped). Every year during commencement week 15 Yale juniors receive an invitation “Skull & Bones.Accept or reject?” Those who accept, presumably the greater number,are invited to attend the Bones Temple on campus to undergo an initiation ceremony. (See next page) For the ambitious,“tapping” is the magic password to a future career. Wherever he turns, the success of the Yale senior society system is ob-vious. Yale University President，A. Bartlett Giamatti，wasa member of Scroll & Key，while George Bush,Vice President of the United States was a member of Skull & Bones. The Yale campus student is well aware that the senior society system is geared to the’affluent outside world, to the world after graduation. Money and connections flow from membership.Reportedly,Skull & Bones donates $15, 000 and a grandfather clock to each initiate. Certainly alumni pay for everything associated with society meetings.In one case reported by New York Times (April 16,1983),the alumni paid for a three-hour phone callfrom Colorado to Yale by two members of Scroll & Key unable to attend a meeting in the Scroll & Key tomb.

Although the John Birch Society,the long time conservative promoter of conspiracy theory，emphasizes that these senior societies are merely recruiting grounds,in effect the societies are the source of a vast establishment network,a formalized “old boy”network that effectively shuts out the newcomers and the non-Yale talented from the halls of power. Because these are senior societies,the emphasis is not on campus activities but on post qraduation ambitions.That is the fundamental difference to all other campus societies in the U.S. “The statement is therefore again repeated that Bones and Keys are peculiarly Yale institutions,genuine outgrowths of a system that flourishes nowhere else, the only organizations of the kind existing in the country”(p.183) and the senior society“is an association with no weak members whatever and the history of the matter shows that unless this ideal is adhered to with reasonable closeness,such a society cannot live long at Yale” (p. 144). p. 2115. .113. ， .

Lani Ackerinan Tulin. Deer Iland had another successful year in 1983,the 76th season of the Club since its establishment under the direction of George Douglas Miller,D. $ 6 8 ^ { * }$ in 1907.Was it the best year ever? Maybe. They’re getting beter and better. The results of the past five or six years have seen the Club become a much more viable enterprise from the years of the late ’6Os and early ’7Os when its future was much in doubt. Increased use of the island is not the only factor in its present sound financial footing. Your generosity through your contributions to our annual fund drives has kept the Club going through lean times and supports it today.Most recently，the splendid response to the special capital fund drive in 1981-82,commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Club,has enabled us to make major capital improvements to our facilities - a process which is still underway.I should add that those special contributions are not being used to meet current operating expenses but are specially designated for capital improvements. Current income from all sources - guest receipts,the G.D.Miller trust, and the annual appeal - has met or exceeded our expenses for seven years,giving us both welcome security and the means to improve further the island’s classic river-style structures.(I don’t want to use the word “modernize”except perhaps in reference to the plumbing. You may so inform your wives.) In brief: the organization of The Order both as Russell Trust Association and Deer Iland Corporation is essentially geared towards the post graduation world, the outside world. It is a senior society. Knights spend only one year as Knights.The rest of their lives are spent as Patriarchs in an active influential organization able to guarantee wealth and ambition. The secrecy is carried to extraordinary lengths. Members may not remain in the room if The Order is under discussion.Words spoken within The Order may not be placed on paper，even in letters to fellow members.For example，witness the following extract from a letter circulated to members by W. Iain Scott (D. 171),President of Deer Iland Club Corporation: But beyond these mere quantitative measures of success,it is the quality of the Deer Iland experience that commends the Club to your attention.There are few,if any,places where the B-n-s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:91:94bb362b6ba0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4546, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "extraordinary lengths.

It serves as prelude to the music of the B-n-s for the “newly fledged exalted $\\mathtt { K \\mathrm { \\mathrm { \\mathrm { \\Omega } \\mathrm { \\mathrm \\mathrm { - } - } \\mathrm { - } } } }$ -ts”and as an endlessly rising canon on that wonderful theme to the p-tr–rchs.\" Chapter meetings of Patriarchs are announced using a format which has not changed since the early 19th century.An interesting and significant aspect of these announcements is the manner in which they reflect elements of the ritual: the skull and bones, the periods into which The Order has placed its history and the club numbers. 1. July 28,1859 - the earliest year for which we have a copy. Note the Roman letters VI in the center of the sheet. 2.July 23,1868 - the last year for which we have a record of the VI appearing. We understand that 1869 was actually the last year with Vi. 3.July 21,1870 一 the first year with VIIlin the center. Note that Vll appears to have been skipped completely. 4.June 17,1936 - note that the format remains almost the same.This one was signed by Potter Stewart， later (1958-1981) Supreme Court Justice. 5.May 31,1984 - the latest announcement notice.Note that the Club number D. 183 now appears,but in essence the sheet remains exactly as in 1859.It appears they even used the same skull and bones. Undoubtedly the more serious part of the initiation process is peer pressure，the conversion of juveniles into presumably responsible members of an unelected elite.As Rosenbaum comments,“the real purpose of the institution was ．..devoted to converting the idle progeny of the ruling class into morally serious leaders ofthe establishment.” An obvious point is that these bones and skulls are former human be-ings. Instead of sacred treatment， they are exhibited and used for ceremonial purposes. Where the bones should be resting decently in a grave,they have become the center of a secret ceremony.

In brief, the photographs reveal the men portrayed as grave robbers who reject human dignity and decency and use satanic devices. The opposite of the mask is the skull. The face of the person is a fleshy skin worn between the two.People who deny the person as made in the image of God directly,and individually created and loved by Him,will seek either of these exits to being truly human 一 the mask which covers the mortal man or the skull which is left after mortal man has departed. Primitive minds who have not yet found God and sophisticates who have rejected Him,desire the mask and the skull.\" Collectivist artist Picasso,darling of New York establishment elitists, was also preoccupied with skulls in a manner very similar to members of Skull and Bones.The preoccupation is portrayed by Leo Steinberg in Art News, October 1971. Artist Stucki comments on Picasso’s morbid interest in skulls as follows: In 1945,Picasso painted “Skull and Pitcher.”Leo Steinberg states that in it “the light’s character is consistently altered.”The light is as hard as an axe-blade,not softly spiritual. Steinberg also gives the painting a Freudian interpretation of sexuality and interprets the pitcher to be the “receiving part in a Satanic annunciation.” He refers to Morgenstern’s poetry on sex and the skull. In this article he feels that Picasso projected himself into the skulls.He made eight skulls in one week as a method of mastering his fear of death.In 1930,Picasso was self-projecting into the Minotaur monsters he painted.He had painted skulls all along;an earlier one in 1907, is in a still-life now in Leningrad. In the same year, he discarded the idea of using a skull in his “Demoiselles d’Avignon.”In the mid-1940s,he used it as a mask,on an owl,or ona horseface.\" The Illuminati was a group of Bavarian conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of government. The society was founded on May 1,1776 by Adam Weishaupt， Professor of Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt.The Order of the Illuminati presumably ceased to exist when it was raided by the Bavarian police in 1786 on orders from the Elector of Bavaria. The Order was dissolved and its seized papers published. Because the Bavarian state ordered the Illuminati papers published,we have authentic information about the organization and its methods of operation. The Illuminati and Skull & Bones are both known internally as“The Order”or“Our Order.”However,this terminology is not uncommon among secret societies and perhaps nothing can be read into", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:93:373576acfccb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4548, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "of the Illuminati presumably ceased to exist when it was raided by the Bavarian police in 1786 on orders from the Elector of Bavaria.

The Illuminati and Skull & Bones are both known internally as“The Order”or“Our Order.”However,this terminology is not uncommon among secret societies and perhaps nothing can be read into this coincidence.Moreover,the structure is quite different.The Iluminati had a structure,apparently based on the Jesuits,where only two members were known to each superior member. Skull & Bones has an entirely different structure,one designed to continue into perpetuity. Each Club has 15 members chosen by the Club immediately preceding. This has remained a consistent procedure from 1833 to 1985.Each club has an“Agent”who is in communication with the Secretary of RTA,the RussellTrust Association,the legal entity for The Order. On the other hand,both are intensively secretive organizations. We have already commented that Bonesmen are supposed to refuse to discuss even membership in The Order，and this unquestionably applied to the Iluminati. Secrecy can be used to conceal illegal activities. Obviously secrecy is only needed if there is something to conceal.Secrecy is superfluous if there is nothing to conceal. Initiates are sworn to secrecy. They are required to leave the room if The Order comes into discussion. They cannot-under oath -answer questions on The Order and its organizations. In correspondence between members concealment even involves spelling Patriarch as P—-ch and Knight as K—t, etc.The membership lists are secret.The only information to be surfaced has been obtained by ilegal means. This poses a moral problem for research and writing.Are we justified in publishing secret information? Members of both Orders use their power and influence to help fellow members. This is a longstanding arrangement well known inside and outside The Order. In Volume One, Introduction To The Order we analyzed what we termed the Chain of Influence in the Whitney-Stimson and Bundy families.How these three families,all with members in The Order,working closely together to maintain a hold over U.S. foreign affairs for almost a century. There is also an interesting piece of circumstantial evidence that points to an Iluminati connection. The membership catalogs are intended for internal use by members so it is reasonable to assume that any markings or information is authentic and has some meaning within The Order. The catalogs have always printed in one form or another, usually at the head of the page, the letters“P and D.”Thus,the 1833 list has“Period 2 Decade 3.” In brief, the organization started in the United States was in the third decade of the second period. So a sensible question is - where does that place the start? Presumably in Germany.

So a sensible question is - where does that place the start? Presumably in Germany. The first decade of the second period would then begin in 180O and the first period would have ended in the decade 1790 to 1800.That places us in the time frame of the elimination of Illuminati by the Bavarian Elector. Let itbe stated in advance that this pamphlet is published solely with a view to clear away the “poppy-cock”which surrounds the greatest society in college. It has no malicious intent.The sole design of the publishers and those who made the investigations,is to cause this Society to stand before the college world free from the profound mystery in which it has hitherto been enshrouded and to lessen,at least in some degree, the arrogant pretensions of superiority. Any one who was noticing the Bones men of ’77,on the morning of Sunday,Oct.1st,1876,was probably struck by the crestfallen air which characterized them all. As long as Bones shall exist， the night of September 29th will be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their temple was invaded by neutrals, their rarest memorabilia confiscated and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the eyes of the uninitiated.We have thought a description of how this was done might be of interest to the collegeworld. The back cellar windows of the eulogian temple were fortified as follows: First,to one seeking entrance from the outside was a row of one inch iron bars; behind them was a strong iron neting fastened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars 1% inches thick;and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter.Formidable as these defences appear, we determined to effect an entrance. The work proceeded slowly and it was only after many hours of patient work that one of the outside iron bars was cut into. Next, by means of a powerful claw,the long nails that fastened the iron neting to the wooden frame were drawn out. Then the bar was refastened in its place by means of a litle puty,and we retired to wait a favourable night forcompleting the undertaking;8 o’clock,Friday evening,Sept.29, was the time selected. First, one of our number proceeded to remove the iron bar and netting;and then,for the sake of more room,he, with considerable difficulty, got out the strong wooden frame to which the latter had been fastened. Pushing head and shoulders into the opening thus made, there still remained a strong row of 1% inch iron bars.Fortunately, there was no need to file these through. They were fastened above ina thick joist,but below,ran intoa brick “damp-wall” that was built up", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:95:b4bc1c2ff3c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4550, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "time selected.

They were fastened above ina thick joist,but below,ran intoa brick “damp-wall” that was built up inside and two inches from the stone foundation of the building. By the aid of a hatchet, it was the work of but a very few moments to dig away about twenty inches of this wall and thus loosen an iron plate through which the lower ends of the bars ran.Upon pushing this plate inward,the bars allfell out of their own weight; the flimsy wooden shutter was then wrenched from its position,and,at just half-past ten,an entrance was effected.Passing in through the window,we broke open the wooden door at the top of the cellar stairs,opened the two iron shutters which close the back windows of the main hall and proceeded to examine the temple at our leisure. witnessed the other entrance and the fuller investigation which enables us to enlighten the hitherto mystified college world about the interior of the recent addition. It also supplied the missing links in the history of the society and the mode of working it,which the previous investigators neglected to secure. One day in the Spring,a young man happened to be passing Bones hall,late Thursday night,and noticed a gleam of light from the skylight in the roof. Reasoning that where that ray appeared there must be some entrance, sometime afterwards several public spirited under-graduates made the exploration we chronicle. They got a ladder,which the painters who were rejuvenating the old brick row were using, some stout rope, a dark lantern,a smallcrow bar, ahatchet，cold chisel and jimmy.One Sunday night,about eleven o’clock, they carried the ladder across the campus and placed it against the rear of the building. One man was stationed across High Street to act as watchman. The others ascended the ladder; previously, however, they took the precaution to remove their shoes and went up in their stocking feet, to avoid all noise. Going over the roof to the skylight, they easily pried it open with the crow bar. The opening would admit them,oneat a time.The rope was tied to the skylight. Separately,with joy and trembling,the investigators slide down.They were now in the mystic recesses of Bones. As the result of their investigations is summarized with the result of prior research, we need not go into it more at length here.

It may be safely said that no hearts in the whole college were more joyful and no sincerer thanks went up in chapel that morning,than from those daring men,who had taken such great risks to disclose the inner parts of our Yalensian Juggernaut. There is always kept burning in the Jo a lamp which is ornamented with a dilapidated human skull and a framed set of “Directions to new Eulogians.”The kitchen is well appointed, and the furnace a new one. Each dish on the kitchen shelves is ornamented with the skull and bones.Each spoon and fork is marked S.B.T. H is the outside iron door covered on the inside with a pair of light frame doors.B is a small toilet room.D opens into the lodge called 324, is fitted up in black velvet, even the walls being covered with that material. A glass case here holds quite a quantity of memorabilia - among which may be seena hat said to belong to Pret.Pierson,a number of base balls and several textbooks. G contains two side-boards of mahogany and one large table in the centre.Besides these the walls are adorned with pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale,and of the members of the Society in Germany,when the Chapter was established here in 1832. There are also two smaller tables.The glassware,decanters; &c., on the side-board,all have the skull and the bones blown into the glass. Ascending to the next floor,we come into a long hall (F) . Entering room A immediately on the left is seen a book-case which contains the Bones library and which is very complete,containing about every book of note ever published at Yale.Hanging on the wall toward High street was a handsomely-framed cushion of velvet on which were fastened the pins of every society ever in Yale University.On the south side of the room is a handsome open fireplace and above this a marble mantel and a mirror. On the mantel were two casts of the pin;one in silver and the other in bronze - the first about two inches in diameter,the second, about three.

Its distinguishing feature is a fac-simile of the Bones pin,handsomely inlaid in the black marble hearth, just below the mantel, and also inlaid in marble is the motto: “Rari Quippe Boni,”in old English text. This room is furnished in red velvet,and is very luxurious. On the wall is a star with a finger pointed towards it. On the walls of the long hall F are hung groups of pictures of each Bones’crowd.

Its grip &c.,are handed down from fifteen to fifteen.The records though,which are made at each meeting, show all anybody could want to know.These records are profusely illustrated, making an interesting memorial to future Eulogians. Some well-skilled amateur has evidently spent much time illustrating them. The motto “Boni bonis adpacunt’ constantly appears. Bones is a chapter of a corps in a German University. It should properly be called，not Skull and Bones Society，but Skull and Bones Chapter.General R − − ,its founder,was in Germany before Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society.He brought back with him to college authority to found a chapter here. Thus was Bones founded. The 322 on the pin has been commonly supposed to mean, founded in ’32 and 2nd chapter.But the Bones man has a pleasing fiction that his fraternity is the descendant of an old Greek patriotic society,dating back to Demosthenes 322, B.C. the Bones records,1881 for example，with huge pride,are headed Anno-Demostheni 2203.A secondary date is from the time of the fire in the hall or annoconflagrationis,as the records style it. Immediately on entering Bones, the neophyte’s name is changed. He is no longer known by his name as it appears in the collge catalogue, but,like a monk or knight of Malta or St. John,becomes Knight so and so.The old Knights are then known as Patriarch so and so.The outside world are known as Gentiles and vandals.

Anyone who was noticing the Bones men of ’77 on the morning of Sunday October 1st,1876,was probably struck by the crest-fallen air which characterized all of them.At any rate there were those who observed that during the church services their eyes suspiciously scanned the faces of one neutral after another,and invariably dropped if their glance was returned.The reason for this is a simple one.As long as Skull and Bones Society shall exist, the night of September 29th will be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their Temple was invaded by neutrals,some of their rarest memorabilia confiscated,and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the vulgar eyes of the uninitiated. First,to one seeking entrance from the outside,was a row of oneinch iron bars; behind them a strong iron netting fastened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars,one and one quarter inches thick;and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter. Formidable as these defenses appear,the Order of the File and Claw,having procured a supply of files,skeleton keys,etc.,determined to attempt to effect an entrance.For reasons that need not be rehearsed here,the work proceeded slowly,and it was only after many hours of patient and cautious labor that one of the outside bars was cut in two.Next,by means of a powerful claw，the long nails that fastened the iron netting to the wooden frame were drawn out. Then the bar was re-fastened in its place by means of a little putty,and we retired to await a favorable night for finishing the job.Eight o’clock Friday evening,September 29th,was the hour selected. First,one of our number proceeded to remove the iron bar and the netting,and then,for the sake of more room,he,with considerable difficulty, got out the strong wooden frame to which the latter had been fastened. Pushing head and shoulders into the opening thus made, there still remained a strong row of one and one quarter inch iron bars. Fortunately there was no need to file through these. It was found that they were fastened above in a thick joist,but below ran into a brick “damp-wall” that was built up inside,and two inches from the stone foundation-wall of the building.By the aid of a claw and a hatchet, it was the work of but a few moments to dig away about twenty inches of this wall,and thus loosen an iron plate through which the lower ends of the bars ran.Upon pushing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:99:28a88fce8d3a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4554, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "was no need to file through these.

On the west wall of the kitchen (E),which contained the ordinary conveniences, hangs a picture of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the Pantry (F) are large quantities of dishes,each piece of crockery ornamented with a picture of a skull and crossbone and each spoon and fork marked. S.B.T. On ascending the stairs from the cellar，you find yourself,after bursting open the door C, Fig. 2, in an entry (A), from which a winding staircase (K) leads to the next floor.The door C,which is of wood,we found locked,but broke open without diffculty.H is the outside iron door,covered on the inside with a pair of light frame doors.B is a small toilet room.The door D,which is without a lock,opens into the main hall (F),called by the initiated “324”.The floor is of coloured tiles; the wals are rather gaudily frescoed,mainly in red and black,somewhat like those of D K hall.A few settees,resembling those in Linonia Hall, and a table,make up the furniture of the room. The wood work is painted white,and, like the walls,is in many places scratched and dirty. EE are two narrow windows, guarded by strong iron shutters. The latter are concealed from view by some light wooden blinds stained to look like walnut. The only objects of interest in the room were a glass case in the southeast corner containing a large number of gilded base-balls, each inscribed with the date, score,etc.,of a university game,and a well-thumbed text-book,either a Physics or a Human Intellect,on the fly-leaf of which was inscribed the autograph of Bones’irrepresible annoyer,Arjayjay of’76.

Entering the room C, Fig. 3, immediately on the left is seen a bookcase,which contains the Skull and Bones library, including a complete set of the Yale Lit.，handsomely bound college catalogues and books published by Bones men.Here,too,was the Constitution of the Phi Beta Kappa and a catalogue of Scroll and Key Society, containing a list of members down to 1868.It was bound in black,and had on the front cover the letters C.S.P.and on the back C.C.J.In Old English text. For the year LI only eleven names are given,and for XLIl only twelve. It contains several typographical errors,as for instance;D.Cady Eaton’s first name is printed Samuel. Opposite the names of the first two Keys men for LXl, some one has written,in a bold hand, the mystic symbol “Ass”. And at the top of the page which give the men of LIl, is writen, “Croud packed by Boies,”and Boies is the name of a Keys man of that year. From the catalogues we learn that the President and Secretary of Scroll and Key are known “inside”as Chilo and Eumenes,and that, as in Bones,each member has a nickname given him.Some of these are handed down from class to class,of these Glaucus，Prisaticus and Arbaces appear to be the favourites. Hanging on the wall towards High street was a handsomely-framed cushion of dark velvet,on which were fastened the pins of all the societies which have existed in college, including Spade and Grave, Bull and Stones,and the like.On the south side of the room is a fireplace，and above this a mantel and mirror.Upon the mantel were a Skull and Bones of silver,the skull about two inches in diameter,and engraved “32 from the S.E.C.of 1858;”another of bronze，a little larger than the silver one,and various other insignia relating to Skull and Bones.On the west wall hung,among other pictures,an old engraving representing an open burial vault,in which,on a stone slab, rest four human skulls, grouped about a fool’s-cap and bells,an open book,several mathematical instruments,a beggar’s scrip,and a royal crown.On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words, in Roman letters,“We War Der Thor,Wer Weiser,Wer Bettler Oder Kaiser?”and below the vault is engraved, in German characters,the sentence; The picture is accompanied by a card, on which is written,“From the German Chapter.Presented by Patriarch D.C.Gilman of D.50”The room is handsomely furnished; tobacco and pipes were abundant,and packs of wellworn cards served to indicate how the society manages to killfive or six hours every Thursday evening.The pipe-bowls,which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:101:8f368725554b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4556, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "a royal crown.On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words, in Roman letters,“We War Der Thor,Wer Weiser,Wer Bettler Oder Kaiser?”and below the vault is engraved, in German characters,the sentence; The picture is accompanied by a card, on which is written,“From the German Chapter.Presented by Patriarch D.C.Gilman of D.50”The room is handsomely furnished; tobacco and pipes were abundant,and packs of wellworn cards served to indicate how the society manages to killfive or six hours every Thursday evening.The pipe-bowls,which are representations of skulls,and bear the stamp of M.Gambier,Paris, have the Eulogian name of the owner and his decade written upon them with red ink; for instance the one belonging to the present “Member from Bath”was marked“Trim,D.75.” On the wals of the long hall B are hung a couple of score of photographs,about 12 × 20 inches,each representing fifteen Bonesmen grouped around a table,on which rest a human skull and crossbones. As the finish of these pictures is poor and of an antiquated style, it is probable that they are taken each year with the apparatus belonging to the society.H is an old-fashioned plain-lock safe,size about 20 × 26 inches,and 15 inches deep,set in the wall. It is probably used as a place of deposit for money and valuables,but on the night of the 29th contained only a bunch of keys and a small gold-mounted flask half filled with brandy. The doors to E and F,which are used as general storerooms,are protected by plates of sheet-tin,but the locks were not “what we may call” proof against skeleton keys.The memorabilia in these rooms was noteworthy for amount rather than quality. However, in the midst of a good deal of rubbish we found four or five boating flags,and a number of old Greek,Latin and German works in MS.None of these were society records，but works of well-known authors; into the genuine antiquity of the MSS.We have not as yet been able to examine. In conclusion,we will say that a thorough examination of every part of the Temple leads us to the conclusion that “the most powerful of college societies”is nothing more than a pleasant convivial club.The kitchen contains the materials for serving refreshments for the inner man; there are neither billiard tables nor any kind of musical instrument in the building;there is a total absence of all the“machinery”which we had been led to expect; the bell heard on initiation nights is not “the old college bell;” Skull and Bones has no secrets beyond a few that may be handed down annually by word of mouth,and no written constitution beyond a few directions similar to the suggestions appended to the Delta Kappa by-laws.

Before leaving the hall, it was asked whether we should inform other members of the college of what we had done,and throw open the hall to the public.We think no one will deny that we had it in our power at one stroke not only to take away forever all the prestige which her supposed secrecy has given this society,but to make her the laughing-stock of all college,and render her future existence extremely doubtful.But while we had no consideration for the mysterious poppiecock of Skull and Bones Society，we nevertheless remembered that some of the Bones men of ’77 are our warm personal friends,and therefore we preferred a less radical course. To Bones as a pleasant convivial club, we have no objections. Let her live on as long as men enjoy good suppers and quiet whist. But her mystery and her secrecy are at an end, and we hope her absurd pretensions and her poppiecock are dead also. How thoroughly the society was frightened can be seen by the way they have sealed up the window through which we entered,as well as more recently all of the other five basement openings.We have no idea that Skull and Bones will deny that their hall has been entered, for we are not without proofs that our tale is true.We have above spoken of different manuscripts, trinkets and memorabilia as existing in the Temple.In several cases we should have written“existed” for the place that knew them shall know them no more forever. In short,while robbery was not our errand,on the principle that the second thief is the best owner we helped ourselves to a few pieces of memorabil,which can be put on exhibition,and a few documents which can be printed,should any authoritative denial be made to any essential point in this statement. Nor will Bones usual policy of silence avail to throw discredit upon our story.Part of our memorabil has been seen by Senior neutrals,and the remainder will be put where it will do the most good,as soon as the protection of a sheepskin has been placed between us and the Faculty and the law.

Our reason for doing this is,because we believe that false impressions are current concerning this society； because we believe that a society badge does not make a man,or entitle him to extra respect and consideration; because we believe the majority of the students are hoodwinked and deluded by a few outward signs and symbols,and because we believe that Skull and Bones,directly and indirectly,is the bane of Yale College.

Ir isa world-wide law that a bad institution should cither be changed toa good,or wholly removed. We have nothing to do with the fact that evil will work itself out in some way. If a thing be bad,the rule laid down should be applied、The case of changing for the worse we notice,but need not consider here. Whe:her an established society deserves toleration,two questions,well answered,will decide.First,is it useful？Second,is it haimful？ If the first seems to cover the second, we say that,in a mixture of good and evil,the former may preponderate and warrant our bearing with the evil.But if there be no gcod, and,beside this lack,real harm,then is the case doubly strong against that institution. For more than forty years a secret society, called Skull and Bones,has existed in Yale Cllege.It receives a certain number of men from each class.These are chosen nominally by the members of the class next previous, although it is understood that a prominent man’s infuence avails for his friends and relatives through several years after his graduation.By observing the men elected from year to year, we find that they are chosen with a distinct end in view,namely,that of obtaining for the society the most honors. Some of these honors are given to literary,some to wealthy men. This,then,is the case.Men receive marks of distinction from Yale College or from their entire class, because of which they are taken into this secret society. Since Yale honors men,this fraternity professes to honor them also. There is something in this double action that calls our attention.With respect to the first method,there are several ways in which distinguishing marksare given by the college. Prizesare distributed for excellence in composition or in scholarship.They are small,but are considered well worth striving for.Why? Because to receive honors at the hands of so venerable and respected an institution as Yale College is justly thought a mark of genuine ability.Then,after the coilege has given what it holds to be a proper degree of attention to worthand effort,this society steps inand by its action says:“ Yale College cannot do these men justice.We will receive them into our sacred circle.To wear our gaunt badge is alone honor.\" Again,anable man is not unnoticed by his classmates.There are many places of trust to be filled by men of means and executive ability.

There are literary distinctions,too,which men receive at the hands of their fellows.One need only attend a few class-meetings to believe that these distinctions are eagerly sought. We often,in Junior year,hear the remark that “such a man’s being on such a Committee will take him to BonesSoweareagaincalldt listen to this assertion:“Your class cannot honor you aright.To be a member of our august bodyis alone true honor.” But what is this bigh power that thus assumes a place above class and college?It is just what we have said-a series of ffteens. It is made up of men-mortal men,who, whatever their intrinsic worth,can,in the name of the society they form,lay no claim to the power they assume. The men whom they choose have,for the most part,been honored as they deserved.Every year,when Skull and Bones makes up its quota,it offers a direct insult to the succeeding class aid to Yale College.Yet intense self-feeling blinds it to its own arrogance. This,then,istheplacewhichhefrtenity flls,inregard to usefulness.Inanswering our second question,we pass over the many minor evils springing from the existence of Skull and Bones.The infuence of continued stress upon members themselves,the discord among classmates,the favoritism shown to Bones men by members of the Faculty,the objections to it as a secret society, all give wiy before a graver charge. When Skuil and Bones was founded, the evil which we are about tc unfold did not exist.Itisan evil which has grown up which is growing to-day.Why is it that Yale College is so lamentably poor?-so poor,indeed,that an officer said:“We do not feel able to have our magazines bound for use.” Her powers are cramped in every direction for want of money. Many of her buildings are old and inconvenient. But three classes can find room in her dormitories.Her officers are poorly paid.She cannot furnish the instructors or aid the students she would.Let us not be understood to say that she does not do much. But she is poor,considering her aims and opportunities. We are told that Yale’s Alumni have not wealth to compare with that of the Alumni of other colleges.This idea has prevailed to such an extent that the saying,“Rich men go to Harvard,”has become trite among us.Is it, then,true that our Alumni,cannot support the University？No！itis false.Her graduates have the power to place her before any college in America,so far as money is concerned. Then why have they not done so？We will sbow why. Out of every class Skulland Bones takes its men.

They have gone out into the world and have become,in many instances,leaders in soshut themselves off from others,and assume to be their superiors. But what return do they give？Let facts answer.They leave their Mother University in want,while they complain biterly of her calls to them for help. Whether the refusal of the many to gve is right,dqes not affect the matter.The reason stated avails for them.Moreover,no one but a Yale graduate can fully understand the case, just as none but slaves could appreciate the curse of slavery. To tell the good whicn Yaie College has done would be well nigh impossible.To tell the good she might do would be yet more diffcult. The question,then,is reduced to thison the one hand lies a source of incalculable good,-on the other a society guilty of serious andfar-reaching crimes.It is Yale College aganistSkulland Bones ↓ ↑ We ask all men, as a question of right,which should be allowed to live？ WHEN the Faculty prohibited Freshman socicty initiation in Yale College for thisand all succeeding years, because those engaged in it made too much noise and acted in too barbarous a manncr,wc cannot see why they did not extend their decree so as to include the initiation in Skull and Bones.On the evening of May 27, r873 ,when that ceremony took place in Bones Hail,the noise made byblowingfish-horns, stamping offeet,singing,yellingand howling, by those engaged in celebrating the solemn mysteries of the 322 order,was so loud that it could be heard over in the college yard.A view through the grating in the rear into the basement showed a number of , ⋅_(7²) and ’73 men stripped to their undershirts and washing off the dust and perspiration caused by their violent exercise.The writer recognized also a Congregational clergyman of this city,stripped to his shirt,who has several times preached to the unregenerate students in Yale College. What was he doing there？Is this Bones Hall a place where preachers,professors,tutors and students, such as have been thought worthy to enter the solemn precincts,congregate and have a jolly good time,pulling cach other up and down stairs with bladders* on their heads,blowing fsh-horns and stamping like the gailery gods in a Wes:ern-theatre on Saturday night？ With what consistency did those members of the Faculty,who are in the habit of visiting the old stone jug,vote to abolish Freshman initiations,while they kncw that the society whose badge they wear on their vests,and at times display with pride,is accustomed to practice the same barbarities which by their vote they condemn？Appropriate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:107:c69305a8023c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4562, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 108, "text": "a jolly good time,pulling cach other up and down stairs with bladders* on their heads,blowing fsh-horns and stamping like the gailery gods in a Wes:ern-theatre on Saturday night？ With what consistency did those members of the Faculty,who are in the habit of visiting the old stone jug,vote to abolish Freshman initiations,while they kncw that the society whose badge they wear on their vests,and at times display with pride,is accustomed to practice the same barbarities which by their vote they condemn？Appropriate pastime,is it not,for men of high scholarship,fine literary ability and gentlemanly qualities？ stamping and yelling, blowing tin hornsand howling,until anunprejudiced passer-by in the street would think that the door to the infernal regions had just been opened and that Davy Satan znd all his demons were holding high carnival within.“ Fiat juttitia,ruat coelum;”and if society initiations are to be prohibited on account of their “barbarity,” why should Skull and Bones cscape} Tbe heads of the neophytes are kept covered with bladden ntil the iitiation ceremonies are over. CAPT.COOK AND THE SENIORS. IN order to remove the false impressions which pervade not only the college but also the outer world,with regard to the late boating difficulty,we here,though with much reluctance,revive the subject.“Let bygones be bygones,”is the well-known maxim,but justice deniands a somewhat clearer statement of the matter than has hitherto been made. It is evidently the prevailing idea that a certain portion of the neutrais of the Senior class were inAuenced in their late action merely by a prejudice against Senior societies,and,therefore,against any of their representatives.This idea is far from the truth. The Senior class will not allow personal prejudices to be a stumblingblock to the interests of the whole college,in proof of which witness their conduct in the choice of the President of the Ball Club.Not a murmur of disapprobation was uttered in this case,for the man chosen is best fitted to further the interests of this branch of athletic sports and to lift it up to a higher level than it now rests upon. In their action in regard to boating matters,the persons mentioned had the common interests at heart. The gentleman whom they desired to see President of the Navy seemed to them the more abie of the two candidates proposed,and hence their unselfsh,unprejudiced motives in acting as they did. An impression also exists that the conduct of the Senior class was the result of animosity felt toward the Captain of our last University crew. This we strenuously deny. No one had fewer enemies or was more liked at the beginning of the term than Capt. Cook. To bim,as has been said before,belongs the credit of our last and greatest achievement in boating, and to him we ascribe all possible honor and praise.The gentleman whom he proposed, however,did not meet with our honest approbation,and hence the contest,-not against Capt.Cook,but against his candidate,on the part of those who,from three", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:108:ad53395b5efe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4563, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "the Captain of our last University crew.

We are heartily glad that the matter has been so amicably settled and that peace once more reigns. AT the close of the first boating meeting of the term,an enthusiast requested the assembly to remain and listen to a few words from him upon the subject of base ball.The speaker deprecated our lack of interest in that matter, and endeavored to raise our spirits in regard to future prospects. During his speech he asked, u Why have men lost their enthusiasm in matters pertaining to base ball \" but could not himself explain the cause,and,as it appeared to many of us,for the reason that,as he himself is a member of the so-called society of Skull and Bones,he was unconsciously blinded in regard to the injurious infuences which that fraternity exerts upon ball. Any one,who has been in college three weeks,knows that a Bones man is not at liberty to speak of his society or pin in the presence of other human beings,and that if reference is made to them he feels deeply wounded and insulted (poppy-cock!).Consequently, those of us who felt that we knew the secret of the lack of enthusiasm,deemed it imprudent to reply to the question,inasmuch as it would have placed the speaker in a somewhat unpleasant situation and have cast a damper on a most enthusiastic meeting. Since,then,that was not the place to express our opinion on the subject, and since we feel assured that our views are not without foundation,we now set forth in these pages the real cause of this universal apathy. Our ideas might have been sent to the college papers,had we not been certain that they would never have been allowed to appearin those publications. A delicate theme like this would not have met with the sanction of the Bones men on the Record or Courant boards,and,consequently,our piece would have lain in a waste basket.Our only resort,then,is this publication. In the first place, we would state that the enthusiasm of one Bones man,though购t be extraordinarily intense,cannot compensate for the pernicious infuences which his society exerts..It may diminish them to asmallextent, but it can by no means counterbalance them. His energy would be put to much betterause, if he attempted to eradicate the evils of the fraternity and cause it to countenance base ball.

His energy would be put to much betterause, if he attempted to eradicate the evils of the fraternity and cause it to countenance base ball. Bones prefers to give her elections to the highstand man and the literary man,as well as to thepolitical toady,while she looks coldly on superior ball men and passes them byμn disdain. If it were understood that the best base ball player in cvery class was as sure of an election to Bones as he who takes Ist prize compositions,would it not call out great amount of latent talent?Whena Freshman enters college,his head is turned in less than a wcek. He conceives that an election to Bones would be the crowning success of bis dourse. He bethinks himself of the best means of attracting the attention of upper classmen.He lays his plans.According to the characters of the men,these plans are noble and honorable, or base and despicable.Thrice happy are those under classmen whose brains are not crazed by the sight of some haughty and conceited wearer of the Bones pin.But such men are few in every class.Freshmen will stare； Sophomores will not whisper in the presence of a Bones man,lest they should spoil their “chances;and Juniors wil stoop to any servility,ifbythat servilitythey canattact the attention of a superior being.Unaccountable as such a state of things may seem,every upper classman will bear testimony to the fact that most collegians are the personification of obsequiousness.Now,it is certain that if under classmen are striving to enter Bones,they will follow in the footsteps of previous successful men. They will study their methods and conform themselves to those methods.It is evident to all who witnessed the disappointment of ⋅₇₄ when her best ball player-we might add,one of the best players that has ever entered college,-failed to receive an election to Bones,and when men of no merit whatever supplanted him,that that society does not make it a point to encourage base ball.Here,then, lies the evil ；all men want to go to Skull and Bones；playing ball will not take them ； hence, men will not play base ball to get there. Their energies will be applied elsewhere. Some play for the amusement they get；others take their exercise in this way；many enter the ranks for the honor of being on the University nine and the notoriety which such a position affords.But not a single soul takes up base ball as a means of helping him to Bones.

If there were no such institution as Bones in existencc, we might look for more proficiency with the bat.But as it is,the honor of being on thenineis thought far inferior to the glory of strutting round the college yard with a ghastly badge upon one’s bosom.Under these circumstances,men in every class who are or would develop into superior players,are led to turn their abilities into other channels.Some seek the retirement of a study and work up high stands;others spend their spare moments in composing essays which -tickie the judges and are rewarded with prizes;and some individuals, whose independence is reduced to zero and whose obsequiousness is only exceeded by their capacity for wire-pulling,slide into Bones as a bad oyster down the throat of a fastidious epicure, causing,only after it is too late,a sickening and highly uneasy sensation.Men come to college for the purpose of improving their literary abilities,and when they occupy their spare time in writing,the labor expended benefits them personally；that is to say,they improve themselves by the exercise and receive in addition a reward in the shape of an election to Skuli and Bones.The base ball player,on the other hand, who equally needs literary culture, foregoesthe benefit hemight gain by writing, and spends the three hours a day which he could devote to self-improvement in exercising at Hamilton Park.At the expense of his own mental development,he works for the honor of the whole college,and is magnanimously rewarded with-nothing. Consequently, only those willtake up base ball who care little for Bones,and who prefer to spend their leisure time in a pleasant and healhy game rather than in sitting on the fence or card-playing. One of thereasons why Harvard is victorious year after year is that she offers great attractions to ball men to join her classes.More than once has she induced an excellent player,who fitted for Yale,to enter her wails.Our Freshman classes have ceased to bring in fine players,and those who could be developed into prime men by practice, give little attention to the game.To tbe society of Skull and Bones,then,is this lack of enthusiasm attributable.These opinions are not from one who is unacquainted with the subject in hand,but,on the contrary,are the honest and heartfelt sentiments of a zealous and earnest adherent of base ball. t uA sound of reelry by night\" A sound that seem to tell That demons wild instead ofmes Withinitpotadwell.

Since the war, nearly all those.customs which depended upon class feling have been abolished.The Record by its“buncombe”stigmatizes one of the most laudable ambitions which an American student can cherish.

Their members never even mention their names,nor refer to them in any way, in the presence of anyone not of their own number;and,as they are all Seniors, there are no“old members in the class above them” to tell tales out of school. There is no electioneering nor pledging for these societies,and no Junior is approached upon the subject in any way until an election is actually offered him.The number of elections given out to each class is small and never varies,and no class nor honorary elections are ever allowed.Both societies combined comprise but little more than one fourth the members of an average class,and the part played by them in politics is simply a negative one. A man’s chances for office are never bettered because he belongs to a senior society,but are frequently, for that simple reason,injured or destroyed altogether. The societies do not take their names from the initials of a Greek motto,but from the peculiar emblems adopted as a badge.This badge is constantly worn by active members;by day upon the shirt bosom or neck-tie,by night upon the night dress.A gymnast or boating man will be sure to have his senior badge attached to what little clothing he may be encumbered with while in practice; and a swimmer, divested of all garments whatever,will often hold it in his mouth or hand,or attach it to his body in some way,while in the water. Only graduate members wear the badge upon the vest,where for the first few years they display it quite regularly. Old graduates seldom“swing out” except on special occasions,or while visiting New Haven; and members of the faculty,except may be young freshman tutors, never display a society badge when engaged in their official duties.Members who have ceased to show the badge openly,nevertheless may wear it about them pretty constantly,perhaps by night as well as day, for quite a number of years.The senior societies, in theory,are composed exclusively of “big men”;of those who, for whatever reason，have become preeminent above their fellows in college repute.In this they differ from those of the two preceding years,which of necessty are half made up of com-paritively second-rate men.

There are two of these societies,but as one takes its tone from the other it may be wellto describe them separately,and treat first of the oldest and most famous member of the modern system. Its name is “Skull and Bones,”- formerly printed“Sculland Bone,”-and its badge, of solid gold,consists of the face of a skull, supported by the crossed thigh bones,with a band, bearing the number“322,”in place of the lower jaw. Its original badge was a rectangular gold plate,about the size and shape of the present Beta Xi pin, whereon the skull-and-bones design and the numeral were simply engraved. Its wood-cut vignette merely represents the emblems,and is identical with that employed for general purposes in college papers elsewhere. The number $\" 3 2 2 \"$ is always printed below it,though the size of the type is not invariable. In the cut formally used,the design was smaller than that now than in vogue,but there never has been added to the simple emblems anything in the way of ornament or embellshment.Popularly the society is known as“Bones,”and its members as “bones men”. The pin is sometimes called a “crab”from its supposed resemblance to that animal. The hall, erected in 1856, is situated on High street, near the corner of Chapel,about opposite the Yale Art Building. It is a grimlooking，windowless，tomb-like structure，of brown sandstone,rectangular in shape, showing a front of about 35 and a length of 44 feet, and is,at a guess 35 feet in height. The entrance in front is guarded bya pair of massive iron doors,a dozen feet high,finished off in panels,and of a dark green color; while heavy clasps of brass close over the keyholes and are secured by padlocks,beneath one of which the bell-pull is concealed. Previous to 1864,when these doors were put in position, their places were occupied by commoner ones of iron,upon which the society emblems were displayed.The roof is nearly flat,and is covered with half-inch plates of iron，which in 1867 took the place of the tin before employed.There", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:116:f3d7fef196e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4571, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "massive iron doors,a dozen feet high,finished off in panels,and of a dark green color; while heavy clasps of brass close over the keyholes and are secured by padlocks,beneath one of which the bell-pull is concealed.

Behind,are a pair of small windows barred with iron,and close to the ground are two or three scutte holes,communicating with the cellar. The building is rapidly becoming covered with the“Virginia creeper,” first planted there in 1864,and stands back a rod or more from the street,being separated from it by a post-and-chain fence.The dimensions of the lot upon which it stands are about 40 feet (front) by 70 (deep); and total value of the premises must be upwards of $30, 000 Before taking possession of its present quarters, the society for many years，- perhaps from its original organization，- occupied a lowstudded back room in the third story of what is now the Courant building,opposite the college yard.At the May，1856,session of the State Legislature the society was incorporated as the “Russell Trust Association,”with the same legal formulas as those quoted in the case of Psi U. The names mentioned in the act were William H. Russell of 33,John S.Beach of ’39,Henry B.Harrison of ^(†)46 ,Henry T.Blake of ’48,Henry D.White of ’51,and Daniel C.Gilman of ’52;- the first of whom has since acted as president, the one next to the last as treasurer, of the association. All are residents of new Haven. The society was originated in 1832 by fifteen members of the class which graduated the following year. General Russell, the valedictorian of that class,is its reputed founder,and the best known of his associates is Judge Alphonso Taft of Cincinnati. Some injustice in the conferring of Phi Beta Kappa elections seems to have led to its establishment, and apparently it was for some time regarded throughout college as a sort of burlesque convivial club. It is said that the faculty once broke in upon one of its meetings,and from what they saw determined upon its abolishment, but by the intercessions and explanations of its founder, then serving as tutor among them,were finally induced to spare it.The popular college tradition，that it was transplanted from a German university,is scouted by old neutral graduates as absurd.But,whatever be the facts as to its origin,the mystery now attending its existence is genuine,and forms the one great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing.

Its catalogue is a unique affair, having a page six inches by four,printed upon one side only. Each right-hand page contains the members of a year - fifteen names indicated in full and alphabetically arranged - with the residences,printed in old-English text,and surrounded by a heavy border of black.A title page,bearing the society cut and the words “Period 2.Decade 3,”precedes the list of the founders,and a similar one,“Period 2.Decade 4,”stands before the class of ^(⋅)43 ,and so on for every successive ten years,the“Period” being always $\" 2 \"$ , but the“Decade”increasing each time by one.At the top of the first list of names - the class of ’33- and separated from them by a broad line of black，are the characters，“P.231.-D.31,” which regularly increase by one with each succeeding class,and are therefore,for the class of ’71，“P.269-D.69.”The first page of the bookdisplays，in ful-faced old-English capitals， the letters, “Otirunbeditf,”arranged in a semi-oval, between two black lines. The catalogue is black-edged，and is bound in black leather，with the owner’s name and “D.”, stamped in gilt upon the cover,- though of late the “D.” is less often indicated. It will be observed that the“D.” is always two less than the class; thus,a catalogue labeled“John Smith, Γ.62^(′) ，would belong to a member of the class of ’64,and so on.What these“Periods”and “Decades”and “P.’s”and“D.’s”may signify is known only to the initiated; but,as the catalogue is never shown to outsiders，they were probably not put there for mystification solely.That the founders are put down as belonging to the “third decade of the second period”may seem to make in favour of the German university theory,in the minds of many;and the blank space in place of the eleventh man’s name in the list of the founders,may perhaps be thought a straw in the same direction.The last edition of the catalogue was prepared in December，1870,and was as usual sent out in unbound sheets to each surviving member of the society.The total membership of the 39 classes represented was of course 585. The elections to this society are always given out on the Thursday evening which precedes Presentation Day.

As the neutrals got into the way of tagging about, insulting and annoying the society on its march,this plan was abandoned in favour of the less formal one now in vogue.According to this,at an early hour of the appointed evening,a Bones Senior quietly cals at the room of a Junior,and having been assured that “we are alone,” says: “I offer you an election to the so-called Skulland Bones. Do you accept?” If the answer is affirmative the Senior - and perhaps the graduate member who sometimes accompanies him - shakes hands with the neophyte,and bidding him to keep to his room for the present, huries back to the hallto report the result. If the election is refused, the result is likewise reported to headquarters，and influential members are sometimes sent back to argue the case; but,as a rule, the few men who refuse elections are not offered a chance to repent. Bones will not be dictated to,and when a man says,“I accept,in case So-and-So is elected with me,”or“in case Such-a-One is kept out,”he is never allowed to carry his point; Yes or No is the only answer recognized. Suppose the elections begin to be given out about seven,in case there are no refusals the whole number will be made up before nine o’clock; if there are refusals it may take an hour longer.In anticipation of this possibility,a half-dozen extra men are chosen in Bones,in addition to the regular fifteen,and in case any of the latter fail to say Yes,elections are offered to a corresponding number of these“second choices,”in the order in which they were elected.By going quickly and quietly about their business the Bones men manage to elude in great part the attentions of the rabble,which ranges about the college yard on the night in question,- barring up the entry doors,raising false alarms,and otherwise disporting itself.The names of the chosen men， however，are known about as quickly as the elections are conferred,and many in the crowd make out complete lists of them,for circulation at the breakfast table or in the division-room upon the following morning，when they form the sole topic of discussion throughout the collge. Usually,the namesare first printed in the Courant of the Wednesday following; though for a year or two past some of the city dailies have had the tact to secure them for their next morning’s issue.The initiation begins,after thecloseof the Wooden Spoon Exhibition,atmidnightof thefollowing Tuesday,andlaststillabout daybreak.Thecandidates fortheceremony are", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:119:b58991b87a0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4574, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "many in the crowd make out complete lists of them,for circulation at the breakfast table or in the division-room upon the following morning，when they form the sole topic of discussion throughout the collge.

As the grim doors open for each new member, there are sounds of a fish horn,as of many feet hurrying up an uncarpeted stairway,as of a muffled drum and tolling bell,-all mingling ina sort of confused uproar,like that from a freshman initiation a good many miles away. Perhaps,while being led to the hall,a candidate may pass between rows of neutral Juniors or other colege men,some of whom may “bid him good bye,” with expressions of congratulation and good will,if they think his election deserved,or insult and revile him,if their belief goes in the contrary direction. There is usually someone to flash a dark lantern upon each approaching candidate,and, if he makes no other personal comments,to at least shout forth his name,for the edification of the rest. To all this the Bones men of course pay no attention. It perhaps takes an hour or more thus to initiate the fifteen candidates;and when the self-constituted leader of the outside hangers on announces that “the last man’s in”, his followers agree that the fun is over,and sullenly disperse. If they stayed longer perhaps they might hear songs sung to strange old tunes,and the tones of the orator’s voice,and the applause which follows it，and the prolonged cheers for “the Skull and the Bones”.And of course there is a supper.Every resident graduate attends the initiation,as well as many from New York and elsewhere, some of whom come to town as early as election night; and the initiation itself,at least the outside part of it, is conducted by graduates alone. Long ago, it is said,the initiation took place on the evening of Presentation Day. “The annual convention of the Order” is held on the evening of Commencement. Three weeks previous to this,- which, of late years, is therefore at the time of the first regular meeting,two nights after initiation,- a printed invitation is sent to every living member of “the Club” whose whereabouts are known. This invitation is upon the first page of a sheet of note paper. Below the society cut is the date - for example, “Thursday evening，July 22,1869”-of Commencement night; followed by VI.

Upon the third page is the list of new members，printed alphabetically in old-English text,and surrounded by the black borders, exactly as in the catalogue, of which it in fact constitutes a new“P.” and“D.” Each one who receives it,by fittng the new leaf to his catalogue,thus keeps the same perfect from year to year. These pages are doubtless stereotyped, and preserved by the society,whose entire catalogue is thus always kept in readiness for the printer. With this invitation and catalogue-page, is also sent a printed slip specifying the exercises of Commencement week.A card-size photograph of the new members,grouped - in front of an antique clock whose hands point to the hour of eight - about a table on which lies a skull, is also sent to graduates,at this time or afterwards. In the picture, the thigh bones are held by certain members,- sometimes the tablecloth has the emblems embroidered upon it,and the whole arrangement of the group is apparently significant. Oficial notes to old members are written upon black bordered paper of the catalogue size, with or without the society cut at the head; and society communications sent through the mails are often enclosed in black-edged envelopes，- bearing at the end a printed request to the postmaster to return them to the society’s post-ofice box if not delivered within a certain time，一 sealed with a skull and bones and the letters“S.C.B.,” impressed upon black wax. Bones men never display in their collge rooms any posters or other reminders of their society,- though it is rumoured that actual skulls were formerly used for this purpose,- but graduates often keep on the walls before them a richly-framed photographic group of the classmates who made up their own special “D.”，- the picture being simply an enlargement of the card photograph before noted.As specimen jokes from the convention invitations the following may be quoted: “Nisi in bonis amicitia esse non potest” (Cic. de Am. 5.1); “Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris”(Virg.Georgs.I 497); “Quid dicam de ossibus? Nil nisi bonum”;and,in 1856,at the time of erecting the hall,“Quid dicam de ossibus? (Cir.de Nat. Deorum. II. 55.)O fortunati, quorum jam moenia surguntl” (Virg. A.En.I.430).At the head of the editorial column of the city dailies,on Commencement morning,was usually displayed the“322 VI. S.B.T.”notice, between parallel black rules,but for the past few years the practice has been abandoned. Up to about the same time printed announcements of the place and time of the Commencement meeting,headed by the cut, were posted about college,and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:121:ac2031bf9418", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4576, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "Nil nisi bonum”;and,in 1856,at the time of erecting the hall,“Quid dicam de ossibus?

Up to about the same time printed announcements of the place and time of the Commencement meeting,headed by the cut, were posted about college,and upon the notice-boards of the different churches,a few days in advance.Formerly, too, similar warnings were printed,in connection with the society cut,among the advertisement of the city papers.As their hall is called “the Temple”by Bones men,a current guess - and a wrong one - interprets“S.B.T.”as“Skull and Bones Temple”.A more likely reading makes“T.” stand for“time”, and so interprets the notice,“Six minutes before eight”，- the hour eight being “Bones time”. The meetings are held on Thursday evening,commencing exactly at eight o’clock,and every acting member is obliged to be in attendance from that time until the adjournment,at two or three in the morning. The society formerly had a way of marching from its hall in dead silence,-tramp,tramp,tramp,-to the north entry of North College, where it might leave a man or two,and so on,silently,in front of the row,growing smaller as it passed the different buildings,until at the south entry of South the few who were left disbanded.Formerly,too,it was customary,before breaking up,to sing a college song whose refrain was,“And I shall be his dad”;but this practice，for lack of voices perhaps,was abandoned some years ago.A Bones Senior is never seen about New Haven after eight o’clock of a Thursday evening. Nothing but actual sickness ever keeps him from his society,except it be absence from town,- and those who have been absent are apt to appear for the first time at Friday morning chapel. A good share of the fresh graduates who are residents,and many of the older ones,are also ordinarily in attendance at the regular weekly meetings.Aside from the annual convention on Commencement night, there are two other “bums” held during the year,- one each at about the middle of the first and second terms- which bring many graduates from out of town. These usually reach the city just before the meeting, and leave it on the midnight trains,so that their coming and going is not known to out-siders，except from the hotel registers or a chance contact upon the street. Each Bones man has a nick-name by which he is known to his in-itiated classmates.One or two of these names,probably official titles, are retained from year to year,but most of them change with the classes,and are apparently conferred according to individual peculiarity or caprice. All members of the society are also spoken of among themselves by a certain general title； another is conferred upon members of the other senior society,and a third is bestowed upon the neutrals.As", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:122:675187f37e14", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4577, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "upon the street.

All members of the society are also spoken of among themselves by a certain general title； another is conferred upon members of the other senior society,and a third is bestowed upon the neutrals.As these titles,especially the latter,might convey a wrong im-pression if generally known, they are not mentioned here. The society itself,among its members，is known as“Eulogia,”or’the“Eulogian Club”.It is believed to have little or no regard to any formal,written constitution,but to be governed chiefly by tradition in its customs and usages.The hall is reputed to be a sort of repository for old college mementos; like the“first college bell”, the original “bully-club”, the constitutions of defunct societies,etc.，which are all said to be preserved there;and when anything of the kind disappears,this is surmised to be its final destination.Though Thursday night is the regular time of meeting，when attendance is compulsory，the hall is generally frequented on Saturday and other nights also,and is often visited in the day time besides. An old member often goes there as soon as he reaches town，especially，if in quest of information in regard to classmates who were formerly associated there with him.At convention time，the members who cannot in person attend, send to the society such facts as to their whereabouts and occupations for the year,as may interest old classmates and friends;and their letters are filed away for future reference. Every book or pamphlet written by a member is also preserved in the society archives;and its collection of printed and manuscript“Yalensia’is said to be very complete. To discover the exact meaning of the inevitable numeral “322,” has long been a problem for college mathematicians. According to some,it signifies “1832,” or the year the society was founded; others make it $3 + 2 + 2 \"$ or“7,”which is said to be the number of “founders”in the class of ^(, 33) ,who persuaded the other eight to join them in making up the original fifteen； still another surmise sets it at “3X2X2”,or ^(*)12 ，” which might refer to the midnight hour of breaking up,or something equally mysterious;while a fourth guess interprets it to mean “the year 322B.C.”，and connects it with the names of Alexander or Demosthenes.What these heroes may have in common with the Skull and Bones society,aside from departing this life on or just before the year in question, is not very plain; but it is pretty well established that Bones “322” refers to that year B.C.,whatever may be its additional significance.While the class of ’69 were in college the hall, according to report, was twice broken into by neutrals,and strange stories were circulated of the wonderful mysteries there discovered by the interlopers.

It is probably a fact that these men did really enter the hall, through the skylight in the roof;but there is no reason for trusting their own account of their exploits any further than this, since,if,as is not unlikely, the arrangement of things inside prevented their making any important discoveries, they would of course invent a sufficient number of suppositious mysteries, to clear themselves of the reproach of having ventured upon a fool’s errand.None of their statements,therefore,have been thought worth repeating here.A surreptitious visit,real or pretended,was hardly necessary as a preliminary to assuring the college that “Bones keeps its most valuable documents locked up in an iron safe,” since the same fact holds good for every society after sophomore year. “Scroll and Key”is the name of the other senior society,which was founded nine years later than its more famous rival,that is to say,in 1841,by a dozen members of the class of ’42.Popularly it is known as “Keys,”though this abbreviation has only come into general use within the last half-dozen years.Its pin,of plain gold,represents a key lying across ascroll,and its wood-cut simply copies it.The design is such that it is difficult to tell the right side from the wrong,and the cut,when printed bottom upwards,as it often is,is rarely noticed as possessing other than its ordinary look. The original badge was a rectangular gold plate,of the same size and shape as the old Bones pin,whereon were engraved an eagle,poised above,suspending a scroll, and a right hand below,grasping a key. This is still worn,bya sihgle member at a time, in place of the usual scroll and key,presumably asa mark of office,like society president or something of the sort.The letters “C.S.P.,” “C.C.J.,” are always printed with the society cut,- the former above, the latter below it,- and with it usually serve as the only introduction to the lists of members printed in the Banner and elsewhere,though the name“Scroll and Key” is sometimes prefixed.

Another, steel-engraved, seal, represents the eagle,looking down from above upon the central scroll and key,upon which the letters are indicated，while an open right hand reaches up from below. The framework of the device is made up of fifteen oblong links,and its shape cannot be better described than by saying that if there were sixteen links it would be an eight-pointed star；as it is,the ten lower links make up five points,but the upper five-in place of the six,which would make the remaining three-are simply rounded together.This,too,was the shape of the inner frame-work of the old gold plate badge.The present pin has been said to be plain, because the eagle and hand, faintly outlined upon it,do not change this general appearance.Neither of the senior badges have their owners’names or anything of the sort en-graved upon their backs.The invitations to the“Z.S.”- or;“bum” held at the middle of the first and second terms-are printed within a scrolllike design from which the key is absent; or else with the ordinary cut at the head of the note. The company of the “brother”is simply requested upon the appointed evening,and he is directed to answer the secretary, which officer is designated by the letter“G,and is his“in truth.”Aside from these initial letters, there is no mystery about the affair,which is either printed ingilt,or,if in black,has mourning bandsabout the edges of the page.All society communications are also forwarded in blackedged “return”envelopes,as in the case of Bones,sealed in black wax with the society emblems and leters.There have been several editions of the society catalogue;and it is probable that a printed list of the elections is forwarded each year to every old member,inconnection with the invitation to the celebration of Commencement night.A card-size photograph of each new group of fifteen is doubtless similarly distributed,either then or afterwards.In this picture,the central figure holdsa large gilt model of the society badge,-the six letters being indicated on the scroll,-and each of the end men grasps a large key, pointed towards the centre of the group.Eight are seated, including the three mentioned,and the remainder are standing,but the position of each individual is probably not significant.Enlarged photographs of the same sort are handsomely framed and hung in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:125:d7d4cc3f7e64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4580, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "card-size photograph of each new group of fifteen is doubtless similarly distributed,either then or afterwards.In this picture,the central figure holdsa large gilt model of the society badge,-the six letters being indicated on the scroll,-and each of the end men grasps a large key, pointed towards the centre of the group.Eight are seated, including the three mentioned,and the remainder are standing,but the position of each individual is probably not significant.Enlarged photographs of the same sort are handsomely framed and hung in the rooms of graduates. The anniversary of Commencement night used to be announced among the ordinary advertisements of the city papers,in connection with the society cut. More recently,at the head of their editorial columns of Commencement morning，“C.S.P. - P.V.S.,P.M.- C.C.J.” or something of the sort,appeared,betweendoublerulesof black.But this practice has now been abandoned. The hall hitherto (since 1847, when the house where it stayed was destroyed by fire) occupied by the society is in the fourth story of the Leffingwell Building,corner of Church and Court streets,across from the Tontine Hotel. The headquarters of the Yale “law department’are upon a lower floor of the same building,and a Masonic lodge-room divides the upper story with Keys. Judged from the outside, this hall must at the most be limited to two not very large rooms,and the Keys men，when assembled in force，be cribbed，cabined and confined together in uncomfortably close proximity.This old order of things, however,has recently come toan end,and Keys is now in possession of a hall, far superior in costliness and architectural beauty, not only to Bones hall,but to any college-society hall in America. It stands on the north-west corner of College and Wall streets,and its erection had been planned and talked about for a dozen years or more. At midnight of Thursday,Nv.2569，teatehefallZ.eety graduates and all, marched to the vacant lot, round which they formed a ring,while prayer was offered, and a society-song sung,after which,a graduate with a silver spade formally broke ground for the new edifice. Then came the singing of the“Troubadour” song,and the procession, dangling its keys,silently moved back to the old quarters on Church street. Only the foundation of the building was laid before the seting in of winter;but the work was resumed the following May，and rapidly pushed to completion;and it is presumed that the formal ceremonies of entering and taking possesison will be celebrated at the next Commencement. The structure has a front of 36 feet on College street, with 6 feet of ground each side,and is 55 feet long,with an open space of about 20 feet before and behind,in other words,it stands in the centre of a lot 48 by 92. Its height is perhaps 35 feet.

Each arch surrounds a narrow opening,provided with three bull’s eyes for the admission of air. Below the central arch are a pair of paneled,massive iron doors,to which entrance a flight of half-a-dozen stone steps leads up from either side.Five similar arches,though without projections or supports,serve to adorn and ventilate each side, and a corresponding number of closely protected scuttle-windows communicate with the cellar below.Rows of short pillars - four at each end, six at each side - surround the top,- the central two at the rear end serving to hide the chimneys,- and a couple of stars are cut out in the stone between every pair of them. The architect was Richard M. Hunt of New York,and the builders were Perkins & Chatfield of New Haven.The value of the entire property cannot be much less than $50, 000 ,and it is to be presumed that a good share of that amount has already been raised by the society. The“Kingsley Trust Association,” which is the legal style thereof, was incorporated at the May,1860, session of the State Legislature,in the names of John A.Porter,of ^(′)42 William L.Kingsley of ^( ′43) ,Samuel C.Perkins of ^(†)48 ,Enos N. Taft of ’51,Lebeus C.Chapin, George E. Jackson,and Homer B.Sprague of ’52,Charlton T.Lewis of’53,Calvin G.Child and Josiah W.Harmar of ’55,and Edward G. Mason and Mason Young of ∵60 These comprise its best known names,and were perhaps chosen on that account, since only the president,Mr.Kingsley, is a resident of the city. In the Yale Banger of 1845，published by the Sigma Theta Sophomores,is a burlesque of the Keys cut, representing the Scroll as a “Declaration of Independence from the Sculland Bone,” signed by the “great seal”, which consists of a view of the historical fox reaching after the equally celebrated sour grapes. This probably represents， with substantial accuracy, the motive which originated Keys. Its founder, not being lucky enough to secure elections to Bones,determined to start in business upon their own account，and hence the society. Its ceremonies,customs,hours of meeting,etc., have all been patterned after those of Bones,and the nearer it approaches to its model the more of a success it is judged to be, both by its own members and by the college at large.

Its existence for the first dozen years was apparently a precarious one. In only three classes before 1852 did it obtain the regular number of members (15)，which Bones has never varied in electing， but ranged from nine - the lowest, in ⁵¹− to fourteen. Since that time exactly fifteen names for each class have always been printed in its public lists,and since 186O exactly fifteen men and no more have joined the society from each class. Previous to the latter date, it was a common thing to give out one or two or more class or secret elections, so that in some classes there have been seventeen or eighteen members,and almost all the classes which at first fellbelow the regular number, now appear in the catalogue with their fullcomplement of fifteen names apiece. The men who accepted these after-elections to thesocietyusually displayed their badge like the others，though sometimes the fact of their membership was kept a secret and they were not allowed to wear them about the collge, not until after graduation. Hence in every class to the present day there are almost always one or two men, who are believed by many to be“secret members”of Keys, because, being friends of the “crowd,”they naturally associate with it, as they would were there no such society in existence. It is also rumoured, with less probability,that notable men are sometimes chosen as honorary members.George Vanderhoff, the reader,is one of them, according to the authority of the Banger,-which, however,may have meant the statement for a joke. Similar rumours are also sometimes started in regard to Bones, but are far less generally credited,and are probably altogether groundless.Certain it is that the fact of there being a secret or honorary member,of there being more or less than fifteen members from each and every class since 1833, has never been in a single case authenticated.Up to as recent a date as 1860,Keys had great diffculty in making up its crowd,rarely being able tosecure the ful fifteenupon the night of giving out elections,but,bydintof electioneer-ing and “packing”in the interval between that time and initiation night, managed - after 1851 - to swing out the orthodox number of new badges upon Presentation morning. Probably it would have given pledges in advance,like the lower-class societies, save that in those days any one standing the slightest chance for Bones preferred it to a “sure thing on” the other society.The true Caesar-or-no-one sentiment seems to have had full sway,and the best men of the class who did not secure Bones elections apparently preferred to go through senior year as neutrals rather than as members of a confessedly inferior society.The proportion of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:128:753ff8023c6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4583, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "new badges upon Presentation morning.

It is only within the last lustrum that it has come to be a rival of Bones,and that the half-loaf sentiment has grown common,which prompts a man when his chances for the latter are spoiled,to “lay”diligently for the former. The Keys mode of giving out elections - as well as the rest of its customs - corresponds as nearly as possible to the practice of Bones. Formerly the fifteen members,each carrying a key some two feet in length,in a body silently marched to the rooms of the men who had been chosen;and then the leader - possibly displaying the large gilt scroll-and-key model before mentioned - may have said simply,“Do you accept?”Of late, however, the practice is for two members,- one a Senior, the other a graduate,- each carrying one of the exaggerated keys,to proceed together to the room of each chosen man.The Senior raps sharply with his key upon the door,and, both stepping in, says,“I offer you an election to the so-called Scroll and Key.Do you accept?” If the answer is Yes,both Keys men shake the Junior by the hand,and tramp back to their hall, where the result of the first election is received before the party start out to confer the second,and so on for the others. On this account the elections progress much more slowly than in the case of Bones,and more opportunities are given to the rabble in the yard to yell “Keys! Keys! Keys!and surge about the bearers of those implements,whose approach is usually announced, by self-stationed outposts,in the neighborhood of the State House steps.In 1868,all the Bones elections had been given out for more than an hour,and the “packed Keys crowd”of ’69;had begun to feel a trifle nervous,when the first key-bearers appeared in the yard. There seems to be no very great significance in the order in which the elections are conferred,except that the one first received is perhaps to be interpreted as especially honorable; but on the other hand this is sometimes offered to a man, who is by no means the society’s first choice,in order if possible to anticipate Bones in securing him.

The initiation takes place at the same time as the other one,and like it lasts till morning. The rendezvous for the candidates is probably some room in the neighborhood of the hall,at all events is outside the college yard,and as the hall is not so convenient to the colleges as that of Bones the neutrals pay less attention to what takes place there on initiation night.Visitors who may be stopping at the Tontine Hotel on the night of Wooden Spoon,however,seldom sleep very soundly, if their rooms chance to be situated upon the north side of the building. Resident and other graduates attend the initiations,and the regular meetings also,一 though to a less extent than in Bones,- and the rule requiring the presence of active members on Thursday nights from eight o’clock till two,is also strictly enforced.An absent member of ^( ′68) ，suspected of make-believe sickness,was one time forcibly hurried off to the meeting by two classmates,who rushed up from the hallfor that purpose,with a great display of crossed keys; and the procedure may be gone through with in other instances which excite less attention than did that,一 though the cases where it is necessary to enforce discipline are of course uncommon. At the close of its meetings,the society was in the habit of marching up through the green，past the State House,to the college yard,singing on the way，or just before disbanding,the well-known song,“Gaily the Troubadour touched his Guitar.”Though this was always finely done,and very acceptable to all who heard it, the faculty - induced, it is said, by the discordant howlings of the“Stones men”- included Keys in the general edict promulgated last year against society singing,and ordered its discontinuance.The current traditions in regard to Keys are not very numerous, nor is the belief in its mysterious origin wide-spread,as in the case of Bones. Its letters are supposed to signify: “Collegium Sanctum Pontificum;Colegium Conseruat Jupiter.Bones having set up Demosthenes as its patron saint,Keys seemed determined to “go one better” and claim the recognition of great Zeus himself.“Zenome” is one the society words supposed to possess mysterious significance.According to rumour,a magnificent stuffed eagle forms one of the chief decorations of its hall; though as this report originated with a ^( ′66) neutral who profesed to have “been there,”not much reliance should be placed upon it.

Keys,like Bones,also keeps the photographs of its members,a library,paintings,pictures,obsolete society badges,old college mementos,and general memorabilia. A third senior society also existed during the time that the class of ’69 was in college.Its name,taken from its badge, was“Spade and Grave.” The spade,partly thrust into the grave,rested upon the footstone of the same,and upon the headstone was represented a crown，- gold of course being the material of the entire pin. The grave was perhaps a little more than an inch in length,and the badge had one or two variations in size and shape.The“Bed and Broom,” it was at first called by outsiders;and，by the more respectful ones,the society was known as “Graves,”and its members as“Graves men.”None of these·names were ever popular, however,and “Diggers”soon came to be the only title by which the society or its members were referred to.Bones men, among themselves,also adopted this name for them.“To give com-munity and sweetness to the eating of sour grapes”was,even more notoriously than in the case of the original Keys men,the object for which the Diggers started their society.The immediate cause which banded them together in the scheme wasa quarrel in the class of ∵64 .Of the five Yale,Lit.editors in that class,three had been chosen to Bones and two were neutrals. One of these two published, as a leading article in the magazine for February of that year, a piece called“Collegial In-genuity,” reflecting on the mode by which men may worm their way into Bones,and, it was claimed,making personal insinuations against a particular member of that society; and:on this latter ground the Bones editors,who formed a majority of the five, voted to suppress the article, and requested its writer to produce another to take the place of it，- themselves meanwhile seizing upon allthe printed copies. The neutral editor refused to obey,and called a class meeting which voted to sustain him,and commanded the Bones editors to surrender the magazines with a certain time, or be expelled from office.As they paid no attention to the order,the class elected three neutrals in their places, and these, with the two original neutral editors,duly brought out a new edition of the February number,“Collegial Ingenuity”andall,and edited thetwo following numbers，- with the latter of which their term of office expired by limitation.The Bones editors meanwhile issued the February number,- with an explanation of their action printed in place of the obnoxious “leader,” but otherwise unchanged,- and duly published the two remaining numbers of their term, still keeping the five original names at the head of the title-page,as if nothing had happened.

Thus, for three months,there were two issues of the Lit. each of which claimed to be the“regular”one.The Bones editors were really in the right,as the class had no legal power to interfere in the matter,and the three magazines issued by the other editors have been known as the “second issue.”The five members of that second editorial board of ⋅ 64 have the credit of founding Diggers,’and they with ten other classmates first swung out the Spade and Grave badge at the beginning of the summer term of that year. On the Thursday before Presentation Day,elections were given out to fifteen members of’65,who were the first Diggers to have their names in print (in the Banner of the following autumn). The grave scene in “Hamlet, wherein the digger tosses up the skulland bones with his spade,issaid to have suggested thebadge as a fit emblem to typify the hostility of the new society to the old one and its power ultimately to work the overthrow of the haughty Skull and Bones itself.Its hall was in the Lyon Building,on Chapel street,on the same floor with that of Gamma Nu;was supplied with common iron doors without and a billiard table within;and was reputed to be elegantly furnished,and among other things to have one of its rooms entirely covered with black velvet.In February，187O,as already stated,its premises were taken possession of and have since been occupied by the sophomore society of Theta Psi. Its wood cut was simply a copy of its badge;and the same design,enlarged,carved in black-walnut and mounted in a frame of the same wood,was displayed in the rooms of members,as a sort of poster; though the practice was not much in vogue after the first year or two. The society started under a cloud,and never emerged from it,but rather seemed to fall deeper and deeper into its shade the older it grew. It was always despised and looked down upon. Even those who joined it,in many cases cursed and ridiculed it by turns,up to the very moment of accepting their elections. In spite of careful packing and electioneer-ing in advance,it always had difficulty in making up its crowd on the same night with the other societies and it always had elections refused. No one standing the least chance for Bones or Keys could be got to go to it,and the best of those left out by these societies preferred to remain neutrals altogether.Psi U men used to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:132:f0deae0a8765", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4587, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "cursed and ridiculed it by turns,up to the very moment of accepting their elections.

There was, however, one member of Psi U among the founders,and four in ‘69 accepted elections,- much to the chagrin of their comrades. Everyone sneered at the society, including many of course who would gladly have joined it had they been able; but the scrubbiest neutral of them all would affect to take offense were such an idea hinted at,and stoutly assert that,“had the Diggers ventured to offer him an election，he would have indignantly hurled back the insult in their faces!” This show of independence after election time is past is quite a common thing; but the men of ’69,even as Juniors,used to shout a sort of chorus,“Todtengraber ist gut,”to the tune of “Truncadillo;” they equipped a burlesque ‘spade and grave” in the college yard one day; and in other ways so defied the powers above them that it became a problem whether the Diggers of ’68 could secure any successors.There was the usual amount of electioneering and packing, but on election night only three men could by the most entreaties be secured, from the indefinite number to whom elections were offered; so these three were released and no new Digger pins were swung forth upon the morning of Presentation Day. The next public appearance of the society was on the first Friday morning of the following October,when fifteen senioric shirtbosoms were adorned by as many new badges,the design being a crown from within which projected the ends of a crossed sword and scepter.This was superseded the following term by a larger sized pin of the same pattern.By a pretty thorough canvassing of the class,in the three months’ interval, these new members had been raked together, and induced to“run”the society for a year,in the hope that under a changed name the same old story could not be told concerning them. At least half of them were secretly pledged and initiated before Commencement，and wore the old Grave badge during vacation，in localities wherethey would be unlikelytomeet with Yale undergraduates. From the headstone of this old badge, it will be observed,the crown itself was taken.

Freshmen spoke of the society as“Crown and Scepter,”or“Sword and Crown,”but upper-class men clung relentlessly to the old title,and the doom of Diggers’ was sealed. Its usual arts were wasted upon the class of’7O not one of them would pledge,either before,on,or after, election night;and so, after a precarious existence of five years, it was forced to give up the hopeless fight and the ghost. Like Keys’, its customs were all modeled as closely as possible after those of Bones, which it was to spade out of existence so quickly.Three men always came up from the hall to give out each election, two of the trio walking abreast in front,and the third following close upon their rear. A dark lantern or a club was often carried by one of them.The yell and outcries with which the rabble greeted the approach of Digger election carriers were far more prolonged and uproarious than in the case of the other societies. The Juniors upon whom they called would be invoked with such cries as“Kick’em out, Jim!”Oh Tom! dont’bea Digger!\"“Shut your dooron’em Jack! Don’t let’em fool you!and so on; while the Diggers themselves would be treated to all manner of compliments and personal attentions, such as were never bestowed upon theother election carrers.”How can I leave Thee,was the song sometimes sung outside at the close of the meetings,either while marching,or on arriving at the college yard; otherwise the procession silently tramped up Chapel street to South College,and so on in front of the row,dropping its men at each entry until none were left. It was believed to have had a good many secret members,- even including some from the Scientific School,- and several’63 men are known to have belonged to it. After the change of base in 1868,the graduate members ceased to wear the old Grave badge.The society was unincorporated,and had never printed any catalogue. Its letters were supposed to represent the motto, Sceptrum Ligonibus Mors. Not only do senior-society men never mention their own society in the presence of others, but then never even refer to the existence of a rival society,and when an outsider mentions this in their presence,even to a third party,they appear to take offense,and perhaps withdraw.

So, too,they are offendedif a man sings,or even hums the air,of the songs whichthey sometimes sing in public；though theseare familiar melodies,and have long been procurable in the form of sheet music. This same fact holds true, to a lesser extent, in the case of the junior and sophomore societies.A certain air gets in a measure identified with a particular society song; and as members of the society never use it except in singing together, they dislike’to hear it whistled by an outsider.A Sophomore,for instance,a few years ago,by persistently whistling,“All on a summer’s day,”would probably have injured his chances of a DKE election; and, in the case of Psi U,perhaps the same would still be true of one who should be constantly humming,“In a few days.” Seniorsociety men may also refuse to speak when passing in front of their hall, and in some cases to notice a neutral classmate whom they may chance to meet after eight o’clock of a Thursday evening.An instance is related in the class of ’67 of two Bones men who brought from their meeting a sick classmate and put him to bed in his room,without paying any attention to his neutral chum who was there present, though he was also a classmate with whom they were on friendly terms.This exaggerated display of secrecy is quite a modern outgrowth,however，being altogether unknown to the old members of fifteen or twenty years ago, and it attained its highest pitch in the class just mentioned,- since when, senior-society men have conducted themselves much more sensibly.For many evident reasons,the costs of membership in a senior society are much greater than in any other,though most of their money is raised by voluntary contributions,and a man eligible in other respects is not kept out on account of his poverty.On the other hand,a man’s wealth of course adds to his chances of election in senior years more than in any other. The annual running expenses of a society,in which graduates take so prominent a part,cannot and ought not to be borne by fifteen men alone,and there are doubtless permanent funds whose income is available for such purposes,- at least in Bones,whose property is fully paid for.To increase this fund,almost every old member sends in an annual contribution,according to his means,for five or ten years after graduation day.

These three circumstances combine to foster in some of them a sort of reckless hostility towards these societies, such as is not felt towards those of the earlier years.This displays itself in a variety of ways.The conduct of the neutrals when the senior elections are given out has been already described,and the fact notice,at least by implication, that they never in the least interfere with the similar ceremonies of the other societies.Nor yet do they ever attempt to break into the halls of the latter. It was in the class of ^(†)66 that this hostility-first definitely displayed itself,in the institution of a sort of a mock “society”called“Bowl and Stones,”- the name being a take-off on that of Bones,and the duties of its members being simply to range about the colleges at a late hour on Thursday night, or early on Friday morning when the senior societies disbanded, singing songs in ridicule of the latter, blocking up the entries, and making a general uproar. The refrain of one song, to the tune of “Bonnie Blue Flag”was “Hurrah! Hurrah! for jolly Bowl and Stones;” of another, to the tune of“Babylon,”“Haughty Bones is fallen,and we gwine down to occupy the Skull.”Another function of the ‘Stones men\" was to offer bogus elections to simple minded classmates,or even to under-class men,- whom they were sometimes able to “sell.”In the class of ^( ′67) they were at their worst, and wantonly smashed bottles of ink upon the front of Bones hall,and tore the chains from its fence. On the Thursday morning which preceded the Presentation Day of 1868, the Stones men of that class posted up a comic handbill, purporting to show the “order of exercises”which would be observed by the senior societies in giving out their elections that evening. There was some litle wit employed in the composition of this notice,and it was the only thing emanating from the “society” that was not at once weak and discreditable.The modified name,“Bull and Stones,”then first appeared; which form has since been retained. Some members of the class of ₇₀ even went so far as to procure a small gilt representation of “a bull’ standing upon“stones,”which was worn as a burlesque badge pin,even in public,and in some cases quite regularly,during the first term of their senior year.

Of course there is nothing to this“society”except what has been told; its “members”are few or many according to the state of the weather;and any neutral senior who is ready to join a crowd for making an uproar on Thursday night is, from that fact only,a good and regular “Stones man.” Indeed, the name has of late come to be accepted as a synonym for any senior-society neutral whatever;and every one not elected to either of the two societies is said to“belong to Stones.”At the time of the last initiation,the Stones men seized upon and confiscated for their own use the ice-cream and other good things which the confectioner was engaged in taking into Bones hall. Since then,one or two projected “raids”of the same sort have been frustrated by the presence of a policeman. Now-a-days,Thursday night is the favourite time for the more depraved Stones men to “go off on a bum” together,and afterwards wake the echoes of the college yard with their discordant howlings. That this“society”showed no signs of existence in the class of ’69 was perhaps due in great measure to the existence of another more creditable organization, some of whose members would probably, save for it,have been leading“Stones men.”On the morning of Presentation Day,1868,fourteen men,who had been neutrals since freshman year, were noticed to wear upon their shirt bosoms,gilt coffin lids,about an inch in length.Their names were printed in the annuals of the next term,under the“senior-society” heading, beneath a wood-cut of the badge, above which appeared the letters“E.T.L.,” but no name. They were spoken of as ‘Coffin men,” or“ETL’s,” when mentioned at all; and, so far as known,met quite regularly on Thursday nights, perhaps in some room rented for the purpose. They said nothing in regard to themselves or the regular senior societies,and they attempted to give no elections in the class of’70. The society passed in the class for a joke; but, for the negative benefit it effected in restraining some who would otherwise have been uproarious, as well as for the positive advantages it may have conferred upon all its members,it deserves to be held in grateful recollection. Perhaps somewhat similar to this was the “Tea-Kettle”society,established in the class of ^( ′53) ，which has left nothing behind it save the announcement of its birth in the Lit.

Its badge was a rectangular gold plate, upon which,within an ornamental border,the appropriate emblems were engraved. These did not much resemble the last badge of the Dig-gers,as the crown was a much more elaborate and highly ornamented affair，and the sword and scepter were crossed behind rather than within it. An existing poster showing a wood-cut of the simple emblems bears the direct,“S.T.G.8.30 a.m.”Another poster，which perhaps had no connection with this or any other society,shows the three letters “Iota Kappa Sigma,” printed in heavy black type,with “24 D” ap-pended. Still another,represents a naked figure just trundling over a precipice a wheelbarrow in which are loaded a skull and some bones and a scroll and a key and a star and a dart. The“Star and Dart’ society was established in 1843,and apparently occupied a position somewhat analogous to the present one of Bulland Stones, though it really had an organization of some sort. The frame-work of its rectangular gold-plate badge was an exact copy of that of the Bones pin,and the emblems of the two societies now existing formed the chief part of the engraved central design.The eagle of Keys,that is to say，was represented as fiercely picking to pieces the Skull and Bones at its feet,while a Dart, appearing in the right upper corner,was about to destroy the eagle,and a Star in the left upper corner was supposed to denote “the prosperity and final success of the society over its rivals.”A woodcut copy of this design surmounted the following notice printed among the advertisements of a New Haven newspaper:“Nos in vita fratres sumus. C. 2954a F. 8 dd Z DL. There willbe a general meeting in New Haven on Thursday evening，Aug.15,1944.Yale Collge,Aug.10.”Possibly there were other Commencement times at which a similar notice was printed，and doubtless posters to the same efect used also to be displayed about the colege buildings at such seasons.

Formerly,when Seniors took a more active part than now in the junior societies,men who did not belong to these were often chosen to the senior societies,but of late a membership in the former is a necessary stepping stone for admission to the latter;not confessedly,of course,but by the rule which is sure to force a junior society into electing every man eligible for election a year later,and to compel every such man to accept such election.

It should not be inferred from this that senior-society menallow their junior year or earlier_society connections to prejudice them in electing their successors.They apparently have regard for the interest of their senior society simply,and choose those whom they think will most benefit it, without much regard to outside considerations. Much of the excitement over the election of Cochs and Lit. Editors turns upon the question of senior societies. Each one of these officers is supposed to “stand a chance,”and shortly after their election the two“crowds”begin definitely to be made up. There are always some “sure men” to form a nucleus, - the Spoon Man for instance,is always certain of receiving a Bone selection，- and about these the “Likely”ones who are not quite so “sure”try to “pack” themselves. Thus a“crowd” is made up in the interest of each society.Its members“run”together constantly,call one another by their first names,and make a great display of familiarity，- especiallyin the presence of “their” Seniors,- as much as to say,“We can’t be separated. Take al of us or none.”This sort of thing is practised chiefly by prospective Keys men, who can make up their crowd with a tolerable certainty that their evident wishes will be respected by the society. It is seldom that Keys ventures to keep out more than a single man from a welldefined pack,and substitute one of their own choosing in his place.Such a pack really has the power in its own hands,and should the members of it agree to “stand by one another” they could of course carry their point; but the refusal of a senior-society election, even conditionally，seems_ so terrible a thing，that they have rarely the courage to make a direct demand. Keys,however, has in some instances_been obliged to submit to such dictation.The society undoubtedly winks at “packing,”and indirectly gives it on occasions its official aid,-though not as frequently nor as extensively as is sometimes reported. There are so many conflicting elements in the Bones crowd that it is never organized into a regular pack,and there is always more doubt as to the way its elections will turn. The nearest approach to a pack is when two or three “sure men” take it upon themselves to persistently“run”another,and make such a display of their fondness for him as to secure his election also.

However Bones may allow its action to be affected indirectly,it willnot be dictated to when once its elections have been made up,and it is useless for a man to attempt to alter the result by conditionally refusing his election,in favour of or against some particular classmate. Though the Bones crowd may be pretty accurately guessed at for some days before the elections are issued, it is the chance of its individuals which are estimated,not of the crowd as such,as in the case of Keys. There is no such general collusion of all the members of the Bones crowd; it is rather made up of separate cligues of two and threes,and single individuals,who hope for Bones elections,but have not much else in common. The fact that elections to this latter society have been refused in favour of Keys is hence not very difficult of explanation.A man whose chances for Bones are rather doubtful may be willing to throw them away altogether for the sake of the comparatively “sure thing”which he gains by joining a pack for Keys. So,receiving an election to Bones,he is in honor bound to decline it,and cling to the men with whom he had joined his fortunes. It will be found that all the Bones refusals in ^(∘)67 and ‘70,over which so much ado was made, came in every case from men previously packed for Keys.Thus,Bones’ greater independence and ceremoniousness sometimes work to its own disadvantage.A man may go to Keys for the sake of takinga friend or two with him whose companionship he could not be sure of were he to become a Bones man; and in general one has less uncertainty as to whom he will have to fraternize with when he packs for the former society. In a direct comparison of the societies,it is seen that Bones in reputation，influence and prestige is altogether superior to its rival; and it seems almost as certain that it must always retain this preeminence. It is, in its main features,essentially unique.No other college society can show so large a proportion of distinguished and successful members. It is probably not too much to add that of the Yale graduates of the past generation who have attained a fair degree of worldly eminence, nearly half willbe found to have been included within the mystic fifteens of this organization.

Its apparent aim is to secure at once the best of the good scholars，good literary men，and good fellows； the former to bring it dignity and “tone,” the latter to preserve its social and convivial character;and its success in equalizing these three elements - one of which is apt to predominate in a society - has been remarkable. It develops in its members,too,a genuine pride and affection,such as they feel in or towards no other society. Men who are careless and frivolous and selfish as to everything else,manifest an earnestness and a generosity where Bones is concerned, that is really surprising. And this, too,in a way not calculated to attract attention,nor suggest an appearance of exaggeration or make-believe.Keys men，on the other hand,are rather given to displaying their society zeal as much as possible. Old members who come from abroad to attend the “bums”are apt to make their presence generally known,and take pains to exhibit the extent of their “interest.”Their affection for the society is no doubf genuine enough,but their carefulness in displaying it suggests the idea that itsinspiration comes quite as much from an oppressive selfconsciousness of the need of “going one better” than Bones,as from the simple force of pleasant associations.Since the time，say about 1860,when Keys came to be recognized as a reputable society, settled upon an invariable membership of fifteen,and ceased to give out any class,secret,or honorary elections,its policy has seemed to be the mak-ing prominent of the social elements，the choosing of good, jolly fellows,-men of ability if possible,but at all events congenial and in the college sense of the word gentlemanly.Ability in the absolute, that is to say, has been accounted of secondary importance as a qualification for membership. Upon a strict and more rigourous adherence to this policy in the future-if it be worth while to express a prevalent college opinion - the success of the society will in great measure depend. In the latter’s own chosen field, it can never hope to seriously rival Bones. To the “solid,” thoughtful men of the class - the big scholars and writers - Bones will always be the more attractive,and if Keys enters into competition for them it will as inevitably have to take up with second-rate representatives of the “heavy,”“respectable” element,at the same time that, by this very action,it renders itself less alluring to the “popular men,”who are and should be its“best hold.”If,on the other hand, it has the tact to depart foronce from its Bones model,and set up an independent standard of qualifications of its own,it may in time gain in its own particular field a recognized", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:142:8a260e21aba3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4597, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "attractive,and if Keys enters into competition for them it will as inevitably have to take up with second-rate representatives of the “heavy,”“respectable” element,at the same time that, by this very action,it renders itself less alluring to the “popular men,”who are and should be its“best hold.”If,on the other hand, it has the tact to depart foronce from its Bones model,and set up an independent standard of qualifications of its own,it may in time gain in its own particular field a recognized pre-eminence.Keys’ real “mis-sion,”as it seems to an outsider，is to draw together a genial, gentlemanly crowd,rather than an“able”one.If a pleasant,agreeable fellow chances to be possessed of something more substantial than popularity，- if besides being a gentleman，he be also a scholar，a writer,and energetic worker,- he should of course be all the more desirable;yet the first mentioned，more trivial，qualities should be regarded as the essential ones,after all, which recommend him for elec-tion.Ability, real or reputed,should never of itself elect a man to Keys. The prestige the society may gain by taking a man simply for his reputation cannof make up for what it thereby loses in attractiveness for “popular men.”Keys’ great opportunity is,by excluding all others,to make itself the most desirable society for the agreeable, jolly fellow in every senior class. If it resolutely adopts this “lay,”it may,with the help of its hall, ere many years, leave bones in the lurch, so far as “popular” men are concerned;and,by occupying an independent field,prevent the possibility of direct comparisons which must always be to its own disadvantage.This seems so manifest that nothing but a foolish overconfidence in its own strength can induce it to engage in a“straight fight’on Bones’own chosen field,where,with allthe odds against it,it must ever suffer defeat. Bones,on the other hand,would do well to consider whether it will be worth its while much longer to take in men for their popularity and agreeableness simply.It is just here that it has met with its most humiliating rebufs hitherto,and that it is likely to meet with worse ones hereafter,unless it changes its policy. Four of the five ’70 men who rejected; Bones in favour of Keys,were simply“good fellows,” who would have been somewhat out of their element in the crowd of the former society;and the case in the class of ^( ′67) was very similar. If Bones should insist more strongly than now upon ability as a prime essential in all its members,and upon this basis,modified by a reasonable regard for social qualities and harmoniousness,elect them, it would secure itself almost absolutely from having an election rejected, as well as add to its own lasting reputation，- even at the sacrifice of one of its cherished traditions,which it has managed to perpetuate thus far on the whole with a fair share of success.Whether Bones makes this concession with good grace at the outset, or waits to be forced into it by the success of Keys, when the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:143:a9a619086dc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4598, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "by a reasonable regard for social qualities and harmoniousness,elect them, it would secure itself almost absolutely from having an election rejected, as well as add to its own lasting reputation，- even at the sacrifice of one of its cherished traditions,which it has managed to perpetuate thus far on the whole with a fair share of success.Whether Bones makes this concession with good grace at the outset, or waits to be forced into it by the success of Keys, when the latter shall turn all its energies upon this one point, remains to be seen.But appearances certainly point to the coming，at no distant day，of what may be termed a senior society millennium,when Bones and Keys shall each occupy an undisputed field of its own,and each be recognized as in its own sphere preeminent; and when the only question in a man’s mind shall be,“In which field,on the whole,is supremacy the more desirable?”Then shal the Death’s head be,even more certainly than now,the badge of intellectual superiority in college repute,and the unfolded Scroll be,even more invariably,the emblem of gentlemenly good fellowship and social popularity. It was remarked at the beginning of the chapter that societies like Bonesand Keys would be possible only at one other college than Yale, and that as a matter of fact they are peculiar to the latter institution. They are not, however，without imitators.At Columbia Collge is an “Axeand Coffn;”at Michigan Universityan“Owl and Padlock;and at Wesleyan University are a“Skull and Serpent”and an “Owl and Wand.”None of them are of any importance,and with the possible exception of the second,are in every way inferior to the Greek-letter societies connected with their respective institutions. There is no special difficulty in imitating the peculair names and mummeries of the Yale senior societies;but the gaining of a similar prestige and influence is quite another matter. It is the high character of their members,not their names and forms and ceremonies,which give the Yale societies their fame. It was a belief in the power of these latter non-essentials that induced the Diggers to persist so long in a worse than hopeless fight. At Yale，the strictly class societies of the first three years supply the machinery by which every class is carefully sifted and its best men are “brought out”in readiness for the senior societies.Yet even here, with from one hundred to one hundred and twenty men to pick from,and thethree years’ sifting processreduced almost to an exact science,it has beenabsolutely demonstrated that no more than two societies,of fifteen men each,can exist. Indeed, it was for a long time a problem whether more than one could live,and even now the two,to be at their best, must occupy somewhat different fields.But at other colleges,where no such class system prevails,where the numbers to select from are much smaller,where the competing societies are more numerous, the attempt to ape Bones and Keys can succeed in nothing save in making the would-be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:144:951331ac1e32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4599, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "science,it has beenabsolutely demonstrated that no more than two societies,of fifteen men each,can exist.

The statement is therefore again repeated that Bones and Keys are peculiarly Yale institutions,genuine out-growths of a system that flourishes nowhere else, the only organizations of the kind existing in the country. In concluding this account of the class societies,it may be well to add a few additional facts that are true alike of many or all of them,and to compare directly their general character in the different years.Each society,save Gamma Nu ,has a“grip”of its own,but society men,in either of the four years,do not generally employ it in greeting one another. It is not a popular device with them,and comparatively few would be able,a year or two after graduation,to give the four different grips correctly,were they to try.Many of the active members,even,of these societies cannot remember their grips without an effort,and in junior year,when visitors from other chapters are expected,there is need of some preliminary practice before the guests can be welcomed in true mysterious fashion. At other colleges the society grips are constantly made use of,and when a Yale man who has forgotten his grip meets an outside brother he extends his hand with all the fingers separated, and returns the grip that he receives,in full faith that he has given “the right one”and concealed his ignorance.It is easy enough for an outsider to find out from someone or other the reputed grips of the dozen or less societies,and it is more than likely that these are really the true ones in many cases.But the whole matter is made so little of by Yale men that none of these peculiar hand shakings are worth describing. In the published report of a recent DKE convention， that society announced that it had adopted a new grip and motto,- presumably on account of the discovery of its old ones,and probably at the instance of the outside chapters.Whether the changes were really made,or the an-nouncement offered simply as a “blind,” the result was of course the same.The only two Yale society mottoes that seem to be unknown to outsiders are,oddly enough, those of Delta Kap and Theta Psi.That of the former used to be,eouo;Kuquos,and was as well known as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:145:3a697936fe6c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4600, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "society announced that it had adopted a new grip and motto,- presumably on account of the discovery of its old ones,and probably at the instance of the outside chapters.Whether the changes were really made,or the an-nouncement offered simply as a “blind,” the result was of course the same.The only two Yale society mottoes that seem to be unknown to outsiders are,oddly enough, those of Delta Kap and Theta Psi.That of the former used to be,eouo;Kuquos,and was as well known as Sigma Eps’isat present,but the one which superseded it and is niow in vogue has been by some miracle prevented from leaking out. Every junior society man can find out without much difficulty the mottoes and “secrets”of the other societies in his class,but he feels in duty bound not to make public his knowledge,and the neutrals are generally in ignorance of these mattrs.At Yale,one society never thinks of breaking into the hall of another,and making public all its mysteries,as is the practice at some of the smaller colleges. It is through these that some of the Yale junior-society secrets are divulged. Chapters which think it a fine thing to steal the constitution and documents of as many rival societies as possible,when they chance to gain those of societies which are also rivalsat Yale,may forward to their brothers at the latter place their illgotten knowledge:knowledge which the latter are usually honorable enough to keep to themselves.It is only in the songs of the first two years that the societies mention the names of their rivals - to ridicule them, of course, but in a good natured way.A secret ballot, upon each candidate separately, in which a single blackballrejects, is the mode of election in all these societies. Every society has a janitor whom it allows to wear its badge.While’69 was in college the same individual was at once janitor of Delta Kap,Theta Psi and Psi U,and wore either one of the badges indiferently,though never displaying twoat a time.A senior-society janitor is not allowed to serve for under-class organizations.The present Bones janitor is a negro named Robert, who assists the professors in the experiments at the philosophical lectures, and is a sort of college supernumerary.His predecessor,also a black man,died in the service,and was followed to his grave by the whole Bones society，resident graduate， solemn professors，and all. The societies of the two upper years have boxes at the post office wherein is placed all mail matter directed either to their popular or official, trustassociation, titles.A letter directed to either of the lower-class societies is exposed to view beside the general-delivery window,until discovered and called for by one of the members.

By other college men their junior-society badge,usually the only one they ever possess,isas a rule always preserved,and is in many cases steadily worn for some years after graduation. Yale men,who were senior neutrals, sometimes display their junior badge,on special occasions,after graduation, but never the pin of lower society. When a Freshman leaves college he usually takes off his society pin,buta Sophomore,if asociety man,is likely to wear his badge for some time after his withdrawal. In taking a general look at the societies of the four years,the first seems a working ground where Freshmen may display their abilities, and induce the Juniors to pledge them;the second, a place where these pledged men as Sophomores may be kept quiet until they are further inspected,and the poor ones got rid of； the third，another working ground of narrower limits,where the select Juniors who have passed safely through two sifting processes may,by making the most of their talents before the Seniors,prevail upon the latter to spare them in the last grand turn of the sieve,and elect them into the fourth,beyond which there is nothing higher. It is a fault of the system that each society save the last is only a stepping stone to the next,and when the last is reached the time left to enjoy it in is short indeed. The size of the classes，and the class feeling thereby engendered，makes any other system impossible,while the system in turn tends to strengthen and perpetrate the class feeling.From his freshman society,a man usually gains considerable solid advantage,and a fair amount of pleasure.The direct benefit of a sophomore-society experience is not very great,and a man loses less by being a neutral this year than any other，- sophomore neutrals being often elected to senior societies,– but stil, he does lose something,both in a peculiar sort of “fun,”and in general social position. In a third-year society the advantages are many,and are of a general as well as local character. The occasions thus afforded for members of different colleges to fraternize together,the opportunities given for making pleasant acquaintances at unexpected places,are evidently of considerable value.A man’s interest in his junior society is not as intense or as lasting at Yale as at other colleges,yet it is altogether greater than that which he feels toward any lower-class society.One Yale graduate would not be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:147:e7490b759e93", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4602, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 148, "text": "position. In a third-year society the advantages are many,and are of a general as well as local character. The occasions thus afforded for members of different colleges to fraternize together,the opportunities given for making pleasant acquaintances at unexpected places,are evidently of considerable value.A man’s interest in his junior society is not as intense or as lasting at Yale as at other colleges,yet it is altogether greater than that which he feels toward any lower-class society.One Yale graduate would not be apt to claim introduction to another on the score of belonging to the same junior society,yet, once acquainted for some other reason, this fact would form a sort of bond between them. The attempt to make an outsider realize the overwhelming fasination, which a senior society exerts upon the mind of the average Yale undergraduate，would probably be useless.An election thereto is valued more highly than any other college prize of honor; and in fact these honors derive a good part of their attractiveness from their supposed efficacy in helping to procure the coveted election. There is nothing in the wide world that seems to him half as desirable. It is the one thing needful for his perfect happiness.And if he fails in gaining it, the chances are that he becomes a temporary misanthropist, that is to say,an ardent “Stones man.”Though the advantages of membership are no doubt exaggerated in anticipation, the real benefit gained in belonging to a senior society iscertainly considerable，- far more valuable in fact, than that which accrues from membership in any other. Quite aside from the enjoyment of the senior year itself, the facts that in after life a man is thus introduced to the best graduates of the college, wherever he may meet them,and that, whenever he visits New Haven, he is sure of being entertained by the best of the oldest undergraduates, and instructed as to the doings and whereabouts of the best of his former classmates，- these facts，other things being equal,of themselves make membership in a senior society especially desirable. College friendships do not at Yale run very closely in society lines. A pair of friends may be brought together or separated by almost numberless society combinations.They may belong to the same society in each of the four years,or in the first and last,or in the second and third,or in none at all,or one may be a society man and another a neutral for all the course,and so on through all the possible permutations. Still, it is pleasant for friends to keep in the same societies,and a general tendency of certain crowds to go together, year after year, has been already remarked upon. No neutral as such is looked down upon or avoided by society men.If the latter usually “run” together, it is because of similar tastes and proclivities,which would induce them to do so,were no societies in existence.In senior year there is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:ASEIPG_cleaned.txt:148:f816d3898e00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4603, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "ASEIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Establishment-Introduction-Order/dp/0972020748", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "ASEIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "for all the course,and so on through all the possible permutations.

No neutral as such is looked down upon or avoided by society men.If the latter usually “run” together, it is because of similar tastes and proclivities,which would induce them to do so,were no societies in existence.In senior year there is hardly a society man without one or two special friends who are neutrals,and with whom he has quite as much to do as with his own regular associates.Such pairs often chum together than do‘two from rival societies; though this sometimes happens and previous to senior year is not at all uncommon.Aside from a man’s real or reputed ability, good nature,and popularity,a thing which often helps to elect him is his rela-tionship to a former or active member of the society. If a father or an uncle or a brother has preceeded him,the fact helps him to follow in their footsteps,especially if they were in any way famous.An older brother in the class above,or even one or two classes removed,is almost certain to secure the election of a younger one, unless the latter is peculiarly unqualified or obnoxious. This species of favouritism attracts the most attention in the case of the senior societies, into which nearly every year, by his relationship with an older and worthier member,is dragged one man at least who is without other qualifications sufficient to recommend him.The cases of poor men taken in are,by the bye,a good deal more common and noticeable than those of desirable men left out. Every year almost there is a great show of indignation over the injustice in the senior-society elections which bring several big men to grief, yet it rarely happens that the good policy of the society in leaving them out is not vindicated within a twelve month. When fifteen men are to be shut up together for six successive hours,every week,and be thrown in with each other constantly, it is essential that thay should be reasonably harmonious if not congenial; and an organization whose members should be chosen for their reputation and ability simply,could not be in the right sense of the word a society. Without now discussing whether college opinion always awards men the positions they deserve, it may be said,in conclusion, that the society system,viewed as a means for separating those who,for whatever reason，are high in college esteem,from those who,for whatever reason,are not,must be admitted to be in the main a fair and successful one.No one can reasonably deny that it has this effect,and that the society men of every year are as a class superior in college repute to the neutrals.

It would of course be foolish to judge an individual solely by his society connections,but it would be far less foolish than to judge him solely by the number of prizes,or scholarships,or honors he could lay claim to,as is not infrequently the practice. To set up any one arbitrary standards whereby to judge character is manifestly unfair,yet,if it is to be done,there is no single test which embraces so many,in making an estimate of a Yale man’s importance,as his share in the society system. Blockheads and simpletons certainly find their way into the senior societies,yet there are few generalities of the sort deserving of more confidence than these,that in a Bones man you will find ability and force of character,in a Keys man politeness and geniality,and in both the most favourable samples of the Yale graduate of the period. 1837 Carter, Edwin Osgood Coit, William Day, Thomas Mills Evarts, William Maxwell Hatch, Walter Tilden Hyatt, Robert Underwood Law, William Fabian Lyman, Chester Smith Owen, Allen Ferdinand Robeson, Abel Bellows Scarborough, William Smith Silliman, Benjamin Jr. Waite, Morris Remmick Williams, Henry Yerkes, Stephen 1841 Barry, William Taylor Sullivan DeSa, Pompeo Ascenco Emerson, Joseph Eustis, William Tappan Field, David Irvine Gillette, Augustus Canfield Helfenstein, Charles Philip Leaf, Edmund Learned, William Law Mitchell, Donald Grant Raymond, Henry Hunter Sturges, Hezekiah Willis, Richard Storrs Woolfolk, William Grey Yarnall, Thomas Coffin 1834 Beaumont, George A.

All the way down the middle. He was very distinguished looking. And he had this one tooth on the right side that whenever he laughed, we could always see a gold tooth. Whenever he was angry, we could never understand what he was saying because he had a very heavy British accent, and “bloody” this and “bloody” that was all we could make out. The first time I ever remember going to the beach, my dad would take me out into the water and the wave would go out, and my dad would walk out with me on his shoulder, and then he would put me down and I would try to run back to shore before that wave caught up to me. That’s how I learned how to swim, and I just thought he was the greatest dad in the world. I was born in the 40’s and lived in a very mixed neighborhood. Some neighbors were white. We had a Chinese laundry two doors down from us. My best friend at that time was a white kid named Bobby who lived down the block, and I used to help him with his paper route. We’d buy White Tower hamburgers after we finished or he would buy mine as my payment. It was just a good time. Right across the street was a barbershop, Tony’s Barbershop. There was a candy store right across the street from where I grew up in Patterson, New Jersey. Living in such a neighborhood taught me respect for others. We always had this big, big maple tree in front of the house and we would all sit out on the stoop. At least once a week a man with an accordion would come by, and we would sit out, all eleven of us, on a stoop, and he would play this accordion and we would all sing, “Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me, for the bible tells me so.” Then he would give us each a penny. We’d run across the street and back in those days a penny would buy a handful of peppermints. Even though we didn’t like waiting, we would sit out on the stoop anyway and sing that song to get that penny. Living in an integrated neighborhood may have been unusual for folks living in those times, but not for me or my family. Back then, everybody on the block got along. There were so many kids on the block. Nobody would dare come to our block and mess with us because there were 11 of us. Our next door neighbor had three kids, down the block neighbors had four more kids, and then across the street lived five more kids.

Our next door neighbor had three kids, down the block neighbors had four more kids, and then across the street lived five more kids. So we had a lot of kids on our block. The block was longer than a city block, from Godwin Avenue all the way down the railroad tracks. Once you crossed the railroad tracks, we were not on our block anymore. If I went off the block, being a little kid, and because I had older brothers, no one would dare touch me. I don’t ever remember leaving the block without one of my oldest siblings except for one time when I really got in trouble. My mother went downtown to work, and I told myself, (I think I was five years old), “I’m going to follow her.” I followed my mother all the way downtown which was maybe three or four miles away. She didn’t know I was behind her but apparently she got on the bus at some point, but I didn’t see her and I got lost. My mother did what she had to do and came back home and her first question was, “Where is Hubert?” Nobody knew. Meanwhile, I was wandering around downtown, trying to find my way home and the entire block was out looking for me. My mom had called the police and the police were out looking for me too. Finally, the police saw me wandering, or they had put out a description of me and they found me and put me in the back of a police car, bought me a bag of peanuts, and by that time I had soiled my pants and I smelled really bad. I wasn’t scared until I saw my mother. When the police pulled up in front of the house, the entire block was out there, all the kids and all the parents. When the police took me out of that police car, everybody was cheering. My mother grabbed me. She didn’t want to do anything in front of the cops. She took me upstairs and cleaned me up. Before she did, she sat me down in the dining room and she lined up all my sisters and brothers against the wall and beat them. I just sat there thinking, “She’s going to kill me.” After, we moved from New Jersey when I was a teenager and moved to Mamaroneck, Westchester County. I really got into sports, playing basketball, soccer, and softball. I was always a fast runner.

I really got into sports, playing basketball, soccer, and softball. I was always a fast runner. There wasn’t a lot of drama in Westchester County in Mamaroneck, because the town was so small and I was getting ready for junior high school because I wanted to play junior varsity league football. As soon as I graduated from that junior high, I tried out for the JV team and but my father got transferred again to East Elmhurst, Queens. That really upset me. Mamaroneck was more like a city. The only thing that they really did was play basketball, and baseball. They didn’t have the activities or the sport activities that Westchester County had, because Westchester County was more rural. The junior high and high school had big athletic fields: a 440 yard track, baseball, softball, and football fields. The first school that I went to was PS 127, where the only major sport that I really played was basketball. That’s when I became friends with other kids in the neighborhood. We were all in the same class and had a basketball team we called the Celtics, and we just beat everybody. I don’t know how many trophies I had just from playing basketball. During the summer, we had basketball tournaments where other teams would come from all over the city. We had one pro athlete, Ray Felix. We participated in the Ray Felix tournaments which we won every year, competing with schools from all over the city. That’s when I started learning all the other school basketball plays that were really great. Guys like Connie Hawkins and Roger Brown went on to the pros. A friend of mine who was a year ahead had told me and a couple of other guys, about this specialized school. We were getting ready to go to high school and we were all trying to figure out where we could go. Our teacher said, “You have to take a test to get in.” We said, “Okay.” We went down. We took the test. We passed. One of the things that I noticed when we went to Jervis, (that was the name of the school) was how many girls there were. I was 14 or 15, and I liked girls. I was always interested my appearance. I tried to model myself after my dad because as a pastor, he always wore three-piece suits.

I always loved the vest that had a pocket watch with a chain that came across the vest. Whenever he would be getting dressed, I would be in that room sitting on a bed watching him in his starched shirts. My dad was very polished and I always wanted to dress like him. When I graduated from the 9^(th) grade, I went right into that high school which was in Manhattan. I had to get up, take a bus, and take the subway to school. During my first year I was amazed at the diversity especially the pretty girls, black, white, Spanish, Italian, Indian, and Chinese. Oh man, I was in heaven! The cheerleaders and the student body would come to most of the home games. Good players got a lot of floor time. My first girlfriend in high school, her name was Alexis. I remember she would always sit in the front row. Whenever I would shoot the ball, she would jump up and cheer. Whether I made it or not, she would jump up and cheer and that’s what caught my eye. After the game, I would go take a shower and when I came out, she was always standing there. Although I liked girls, I was awkward around them and didn’t know what to say. I remember coming home and asking my older brothers, “What do you say and how should the conversation go?” I went to my sisters and they would guide me through and I’d always go to school the next day and try out what they had said. If it worked, I would stick with it. If it didn’t, I’d come home for more education. I would make a suit every two weeks. All I needed was three and a half yards of material. The last suit I made for myself, I stayed up all night. My mom and dad bought me a sewing machine and I had all the things that I needed. I had my yard stick. I had my thread. I could make button holes. I could make you a suit because in class that’s what we did. So whatever you did in class, you brought home with you and would do the same thing at home. It was a navy blue suit with cuffs. I got home from school. I put my pattern down. I cut it out. I basted it, using this wooden frame.

I basted it, using this wooden frame. I did not go to sleep until the following day because I wanted to wear that suit to school in the morning. When I got up, I had that suit and I pressed it out. I already had my light blue shirt and my tie. I wore that suit to school the next day. Once I made a suit, it’s very easy to make others. Making my own clothes made me feel independent and taught me to be task oriented. I can still sew. If you put a machine in front of me and if I had to make a button hole, I would know how to do it. It’s something I have never forgotten and to this day I can put cuffs in pants and stitch up a tear. If you put it in front of me I can fix it. I did it for three years, and I had every intention of going to FIT, which was the Fashion Institute of Technology. In my last year of high school I went to school a week and I worked a week. I was fortunate enough to be assigned to Saks Fifth Avenue. I got paid a wage for working at Saks Fifth Avenue and I was able to buy shoes. When I worked at Saks, I couldn’t go in there in dungarees even as a worker. I had to dress sharp. I worked in the tailor shop or the alterations shop where I honed my skills. I had every intention of going on and opening up a line because I had become that good. The best tailors in high school were the Italian students, they could sew. I remember Vido Pazentino who could sew by hand faster than some people could sew with a machine. He had been sewing since he was five years old and he was a great tailor. If I said to Vito, “I want to make this blazer,” he would say, “No problem, no problem.” He would help me out and before two days of class were over, I would have my blazer done. My last year of high school, I was still playing basketball, and our high school team played at Madison Square Gardens.

As graduation grew closer and closer, we had an awards assembly for the entire school. Students received letters for best attendance and for all the teams they were on. I got team letters for basketball, for track, and for hand ball. I had 14 letters and it seemed like every time I would go up I would get another award for something else. Then came the prom which was most exciting. I was chosen king of the prom. The queen of the prom was a gorgeous Chinese girl, Peggy Chen. At the prom the king and queen’s chairs were up front on the stage. We also had the first dance together. My girlfriend at the time, Lorraine, didn’t like that. When I graduated from high school, Lorraine and I had dated probably a year and a half. We were close. She lived in St. Albans, Queens and I lived in East Elmhurst, Queens. I had to take a bus and a train to get to her house. She would come and visit and I would go and visit. High school was one of the best times of my life because I really enjoyed it. I met a lot of people, guys from all over the City and to this day I could probably name them. My best friend at the time was Ronnie. He went to Brooklyn Tech and we are still best friends. Lorraine and I dated all through high school. We went all over to parties and met people from all over the place. If there was a party in the Bronx, we would go to the Bronx and if there was a party in Queens, they would come to Queens. All my neighborhood friends are still friends today after almost 60 years. had intentions of going on to college. I had a basketball scholarship to Clark University. When I got out of high school, my brothers had come home on leave and I saw them in their uniforms. That was it. I said, “Oh no. I’ve got to get into the military,” because girls were flocking all over them. I wanted to go, but I didn’t want to go into the Marine Corps. I didn’t want to go into the Army. I was begging my dad at the time. I said, “Dad, please, I want to go in the Navy.” The recruiter was right down the street from my school.

I said, “Dad, please, I want to go in the Navy.” The recruiter was right down the street from my school. So one day after school I went to the recruiter and asked, “I want to join the Navy and what do I have to do?” I was about to graduate, had turned 17, and he said, “Well, fill out the paperwork and bring it back and do all this stuff.” I graduated in June, and I hadn’t even told my dad or my mother. It wasn’t until the recruiter said, “Listen. Because you’re only 17, your father’s going to have to sign it.” My parents wanted me to go college and get that education. My oldest brother, James, was in the Air Force. My brother next to him, Sam, was in the Marine Corps. My brother Ben was in the Marine Corps. I wanted to go into the Navy and see the world. When the recruiter told me that my Dad had to sign the paperwork, I said, “What? Are you kidding?” That was the longest ride home I ever had in my life because how was I going to swing this? Because I was the baby boy, my mom and dad wanted me home since all my other brothers were in the military, and my brother Joe couldn’t go into the military as he had been hurt in an accident. They wanted one son home to go to school and get an education. When I got home, my mom was in bed. I said, “Mom. Listen. I want to go into the service. I really don’t know what I want to do now. I’m not ready to go to college.” She understood because she had all the girls there. She was easy. When that recruiter said, “Listen, in order for you to get on the bus, or in order for you to go to boot camp, you’re going to have to bring your father down here to sign these papers,” I thought to myself, “Oh my God.” I said, “Well, can my mother sign them?” He said, “No, it has to be your dad because you’re not 18.” I was stranded. I started sweating and the recruiter said, “Bishop, it’s going to be okay. You’ll see. When he comes back home, you’re not even going to recognize him.” Finally, he signed the paper. I gave him a bear hug and I was on that bus. I got on that bus going down to White Hall Street, to get my physical. I was on my own.

I got on that bus going down to White Hall Street, to get my physical. I was on my own. I didn’t know what to expect, but I was looking forward to the adventure. At the airport, we waited for our plane, and once the plane arrived there were other guys from other parts of the city. The plane was full with the navy recruits that were going to Great Lakes, Illinois. When we landed in Illinois, there was a bus waiting for us. When we got off the plane outside the terminal, we all boarded the bus. I thought, “I wonder if we’re all going to be in the same company, or what is it going to be like?” By that time there had to be a couple a hundred guys that had come from all over the United States to Great Lakes or to the airport, and we all boarded buses, sat back, waiting, wondering what this experience was going to be like? Before we even got off the bus, I saw the company commander, either a chief or first class petty officer. The bus doors opened up, and this guy got on. I don’t remember his name because he never told us. He said, “When I give the signal or when I give the order, I don’t want to see anything but asses and elbows, getting off this bus and falling into a straight line. No talking, no nothing.” He was a big white man. He appeared to be in great shape, so I figured he must be the PT instructor. Everybody was so nervous; nobody wanted to make a mistake. There was no talking, and when he said “Move,” we got on that bus in less than a minute. Later, we were all off the bus, and had our bags by our feet. He said, “I don’t know how many of you people know your left from your right, but by the time you leave here you’re going to know that and a lot more.” Everybody was so frightened because we didn’t want this guy to come up to us and yell at us. So everybody just followed orders, nobody looked at anyone else. The first thing we did was took a 30 second shower, and dressed in skivvy shorts, tops and bottoms. We got haircuts; in essence they shaved our heads. I didn’t care. I figure that was all a part of the process. I think for the most part everybody was just ready.

Whatever this guy said to do, whenever he said go, we just followed directions. Once we got our heads shaved, we got in line and were issued clothing. As we went through the line, we gave our size; small, medium, or large. It wasn’t size 32; it was small, medium and large. I weighed about 130 pounds, so I immediately took size medium, and medium was pretty good. At the end of the line we got sea bags. We put in what they told us, exactly what they wanted us to put on: dungarees, a dungaree shirt, a white hat and boondockers. Boondockers were like desert boots, but leather. We got socks, pants and underwear. Everything we needed we got: toothbrush, toothpaste, hats, dungaree jacket. Everything was put into the sea bag, except for what they’ve told us they wanted us to put on. Once all that was done, everybody lined up to form our company. We stood there at attention, with our sea bags by our feet and the company commander said, ‘’Okay, stay in here. Your company commander will be coming to pick you up and take you to your barracks.’’ We must have stood there for maybe half an hour until our company commander showed up, First Class Petty Officer Johnson. Officer Johnson was about S^(′)11%_(,)^(𝓃) but stocky. He introduced himself. Nobody said anything. “When I speak to you it’s: aye, aye, sir.’’ He packed us all up, we put our sea bags on our shoulders, all 103 of us in the company. Believe it or not, I was the only black guy in the entire company and everybody else was from the South. We now arrived at Camp Moffet and Officer Johnson told us, “This is going to be what we are doing at Camp Moffet,” meaning we are going to be testing. He was civil but he was in charge and he was not a guy to mess with. He explained, “This is why you are here, we are going to teach you, you are going to be men – you came here as boys – but when you leave here you are going to be men. All you gentlemen that think you cannot hack this, step out right now.” He said, “This is not a picnic.

You aren’t drafted, you signed up to be in the Navy, this is a man’s navy, this is not for the faint of heart, you are going to learn a lot, you are going to be expected to learn a lot and we are going to expect you to act like men. There is no room in this man’s navy for kids.” I think out of the 100, three guys stepped forward and said, “I did not sign up for this. I did not think it was going to be like that.” Then he called someone on the phone who came over and got these recruits who went back to the recruit deck where we arrived. Then he went on with his speech, “This is what we are going to do, we are going to be here for three weeks. You are going to learn military procedure. This is what is going to be expected of you, what we expect from you and this is what you can expect from us.” It was not to make us feel comfortable, but to let us know that we were in the military now, and we were not to do anything unless we were told to do it. It was all about following directions. Officer Johnson said, “If you follow directions you will be okay. If you do not follow directions, you are going to find yourself in a bad place.” I followed directions to the tee, because one of the things that I thought at that time was, “Damn I am the only black guy here. I am not going to mess this up.” Officer Johnson went on to say, “There is no color, there is no religion, there is no room for any of that crap. You are in the navy. This is one unit and we are going to act like one unit. If you follow directions, you should not have any problems. If you do not follow directions, you are going to have major problems.” Everybody was looking straight ahead. He said, “Does anybody have any questions?” Nobody raised a hand. Later, when I looked in the mirror, I said, “I made it and I am going to make the most of it.” One of Officer Johnson’s phrases was, “Just make sure you are squared away at all times.” Squared away means that you are clean, that your clothes are neat and clean, your shoes look polished and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:9:645a63e0a3a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4620, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "you are going to have major problems.” Everybody was looking straight ahead.

I made up my mind right then, that was who I was. I am sure all the other guys made up their minds and thought the same thing. I had a bald head, I had no mustache and I looked like I was maybe fourteen years old. I had not even started shaving yet and one of the things Officer Johnson said was, “I expect you to be clean-shaven at all times. Your bunk will be made at all times. There will be no sitting on the bunk, no lying on the bunk and these are the rules. If I catch you deviating from those rules it is going to be a problem.” I made sure I had no problems with the commanding officers dictates. That first night, I think we got to the barracks about 8:00. By the time we finished up, it must have been after 1:00 in the morning. We had picked up our clothes, got our shaved heads and by the time we got to bed, it had to be 2:30 in the morning. We got to bed and then the lights went on. It was 6:00 in the morning. The Company Commander picked up a garbage can and threw it down the middle of the squad bay to shock us. We got dressed; we brushed our teeth. Then we waited. Then we fell outside and went to breakfast. Company Commander Johnson told us, “When you finish breakfast and you leave the mess hall, go to stand.” The first guy would go stand in the spot and everybody would form around that guy. Whatever order that we started out in, that’s the order that he wanted us to be in when everybody finished breakfast. We were all lined up outside in a company setting. Then he would come and pick us up. We would march back to the barracks. The second day there, we got these little blue handbooks. That was called the Navy manual. If we were the first outside, we pulled that manual out of our pocket and put it up in front of our face. We were standing outside, looking around watching this. We had our faces in that manual because we had to study that manual. We hadn’t received any rifles while we were at Camp Moffet.

We had our faces in that manual because we had to study that manual. We hadn’t received any rifles while we were at Camp Moffet. What Officer Johnson did was to take us out to what was referred to as “the grinder,” an asphalt parade field. Once we were settled with our clothes and making up our beds and going through the basic introduction speech, he took us out to this grinder, and lined us all up in rows. He said, “I need a guide-on.” And he said, “Who wants to be a guide-on?” I didn’t even know what the hell that was. I raised my hand. It was a flag pole about seven feet long and it had our company flag on it. Our company was company 372. He gave me the guide-on and I was put on the right side, up front of the company, to keep them in line. So whenever we were marching, I was always the guide-on. Nobody got in front of me. Nobody got beside me. They were always behind me and the petty officer of the company who was in charge of the company when the company commander wasn’t there. He was a white guy named Paul. The company commander would take us out to the grinder and he would teach the company the basic, right face, left face, about face. The number one thing we did every day was calisthenics. Five guys got weeded out from the calisthenics or they were put on the fat brigade. If we couldn’t cut it or if we were overweight, we would run in place and we would have to run around the ground. I would have to put the flag at port arms, and I would be in front of the company. Company Commander Johnson would do all the exercises with us. He would be out front with us and he would run with us on the side. He would be shouting, “One two three four, one two three four, one two three four, one two three four.” We had to be in step, “One two three four, one two three four, one two three four.” There would be four across and four back. Then we would have the first platoon and we would have the second platoon. There were two platoons consisting of 95 guys. Camp Moffet was a wooden barracks. It was tough to clean the floors because it was all wood floors and it had stains on them and we had to get down and scrub them, scrub them, scrub them, but Camp Geiger was all brick.

It was tough to clean the floors because it was all wood floors and it had stains on them and we had to get down and scrub them, scrub them, scrub them, but Camp Geiger was all brick. It was brick like stone floors, steel bunk beds but it was completely different. There were three floors in the barracks and there was a company on each floor of those barracks. We were on the second floor of the barracks, company 372. We had made it across the road, so things were a little more relaxed, but not the discipline. Commander Johnson wasn’t yelling as much, because we were kind of locked into what we needed to do, what we were supposed to do, and as long as we followed directions, it was okay. But if one guy messed up, he would tell us in a minute whether we were marching, whether we were doing calisthenics, to drop down. Because I had the guide on, holding the flag, there were times that I would just stand there because I wasn’t supposed to lay the guide on down. But if one guy messed up, Commander Johnson would turn to me and say, “Put that god damn guide-on down, get down there.” So I put that guide-on on the ground and we started doing push-ups. One, down one, down two, down three, and that made everybody pissed off. A couple of guys – if he said right face or left face or whatever – would mess up and they did it more than once. Johnson would say, “God damn it, company get down. Get out there, here we go, down one, down two.” We would have to do 20 push-ups. If we were doing calisthenics, one of the things we hated to do, were those bend and thrust, where we would go down and squat and then we had to kick our legs out and then come back up, and then stand up and then go back down and do it again. If one guy messed up, if we weren’t in sync, he’d drop us down in a minute. Guys would roll over and lie on their backs, and Sargent Johnson would be walking around watching us and he would say something like, “God damn it, get up, get up!” And then he’d single a guy out the guy that was messing up and put him in the front. He would tell us, “This is why you do get to do it over, this guy right here.” He was trying to make us act like a unit.

He would tell us, “This is why you do get to do it over, this guy right here.” He was trying to make us act like a unit. We never retaliated against a fellow if he screwed up. When the drill instructor would leave, we would be by ourselves. Some guys would say, “Goddamn man, why didn’t you get this right?” Some of the guys walked like they were behind a plow, but we were pretty good up to a point. I think my fifth week at boot camp is when shit started to happen. I was the only black guy in the company. Once the lights went out and the drill instructor left, we were left on our own, with the company petty officer. He was one of us, but he was elevated to the company petty officer. Then the cat calls would start at night, “Oh yes, I remember throwing the nigger into the swamp.” I knew who was doing it so at night I would crawl out of my bunk, with my combat boots on, after it was good and dark, and I would crawl over to their bunk and beat the shit out of them. Boom, boom, boom, three shots, and then I would crawl back to my bunk and get in bed. During the day if something happened, I would tell the guy to meet me in the bathroom after lights out, because lights were always on in the bathroom. Once the lights were out we would go in the bathroom, throw a few blows, no hard feelings. We would go back and get in our bunks. That happened throughout boot camp. By the time boot camp was over, I had their respect. We may not have liked each other, but they knew they couldn’t say whatever they wanted, and I wasn’t going to let it go. That was one thing that was great about growing up in a big family, I knew how to fight. After boot camp was over, the entire company elected me honor man of the company. I was a team player; I was out front as the guide-on. When we were in competition in boot camp, we got these little flags attached to the guide-on to show that we were experts in marching, experts in school, or experts in drills. We had company competitions and we were one of the top companies. In our fifth week they gave us rifles, but I didn’t get a rifle because I was the guide-on.

So whenever the company was doing right shoulder, left shoulder, all the different shoulder movements, present arms, order arms, if we were marching, I would be twirling the guide-on. The company commander used to come up to me while we were marching, and he’d say, “You think you’re hot shit, right?” That was a big joke to me, because he enjoyed watching me. I enjoyed doing it, and he could see that I was really enjoying the marching. He said, “Well I see how much enjoyment you get out of marching. It seems like you really enjoy it and you’re very coordinated. They’re looking for a good man, and you have to be a certain height. You’ve got to be coordinated, because it’s not a big unit, but it’s a specific unit. They do parades, all kinds of ceremonial things, and you’ll go to the White House.” At the time, I had planned on going to school for electronics at Great Lakes where all the schools were at the time. At graduation we were allowed to wear dress blues, standing on a field grinder, all the dignitaries and those families that could come were sitting in the grandstands. Then they had the navy band out there playing. The company commander was out front and when he called us to attention, I got a chill. “Company 372, attend hut!” We were snappy, and by that time we were all in shape. Once I’d left boot camp, before I got to my next duty station, I had a thirty day leave. That was probably around November 25 or 26, 1962 and I went home for the first time in twelve weeks, and it was a joyous occasion. My dad met me, and took me home. I was in my dress blues, fresh out of boot camp. My family was all at home and my friends came over. Unbeknown to me, the entire time that I was in boot camp, my brother Joe, who was a year older than I was, had worn all my clothes. All the clothes that I had made, all the clothes that I had bought in my senior year of high school, he was out having a fashion show standing on one of the main terraces in our neighborhood greeting everybody in the neighborhood. They called him the, “Mayor of East Elmhurst,” and every day he would have on a different outfit that belonged to me.

They called him the, “Mayor of East Elmhurst,” and every day he would have on a different outfit that belonged to me. Normally, if I had been home and that happened, I probably would have boxed his ears, but I think the thirteen weeks that I spent in boot camp matured me. I had grown, definitely physically, but also I had matured as a person, I was not so hot-tempered. Normally I would have been ready to fight, especially when it came to my clothes, because I had taken so much care in making them and in taking care of them. I’m like that to this day, really sensitive about my clothes. My dad took me shopping and bought me a couple of outfits. This time, because I was going to a duty station, I was going to take all my clothes that weren’t ruined; I was going to take them back to DC with me. I remember getting to the port authority and having to jump in a cab and take the cab to the naval base and when I got to the gate, there were Navy guards at the gate. Part of the responsibility of the honor guard was to man the gates coming on to the base. The cab driver stopped at the gate and asked where he was supposed to go, and was told to go to the administration building, straight down the road. It was a building that they called the “Quarter Deck.” It was the main entrance to the quarter deck, as it would be on a ship. When you walked up the ramp, the first place you would come to would be the quarter deck and that’s the main area where the officer of the day would watch and everybody was located in that one area. I struggled with my bags getting up to the second deck and asked a guy, “So where do I report?” and he showed me to the office. I put my bags outside the office door and I went in, snapped to attention. His name was Lieutenant Simonitis, and he was the officer of the day, but he was also the executive officer of the honor guard. I went in, snapping to attention, giving him a salute and handed my orders to him and said, “Seaman Apprentice, Hubert Clark reporting for duty, sir.” I thought to myself, if I had known that, I would have told the officers how I felt.

So that’s how I become the booty sniffer or a pallbearer. My first day there I got stowed away, put my uniforms up, and had my locker and key. Then Boats told me, “When you get stowed away, you should come to my room, and I will explain to you everything that you need to know, need to do.” We shined our brass with Brassos, and I burnished it and shined it. We had to get our shoes polished white and we had to get white that extra sole. We also had a horse shoe on the heel, and then we had cleats stuck on the front and on the side. So when we were marching heel to toe, it sounded like a horse. The sound was great when everybody marched in unison. We would train every day getting the difficult routines down. Unless we had a detail, we were up on the third deck, what we called our training area. We would train how to carry out military funerals. Since this was my first time I would go and I would watch how they trained. These guys were good. One would have to see it to really appreciate how they trained, how they carried out military funerals. So for the first month, I did not have an opportunity to go out and carry out any funerals because I was still in training. When the first platoon had the detail for the day, I would go to Arlington, but the only ones there were pallbearers, the firing squad, and the person that was in charge of the team. If it was a Priest funeral, ten guys were part of the entourage. A chief was in charge of the pallbearers and the firing squad. The higher the rank, the bigger the funeral was. The biggest funeral would be called an 87. That would be a full naval military funeral with three platoons of enlisted men, the firing squad, and the officer in charge of the honor guard. He would be in charge of the entire ceremony. My first funeral I was shaking in my boots. I was nervous although I knew what to do, but this was the first time that I had ever handled a casket along with the team. I remember we were sitting on the bus waiting for the hearse to show up.

As soon as we spotted the hearse, we jumped out, and formed up. The firing party went twenty yards away from the graveside and when it formed up, I was sitting on the bus and I was saying to myself, “I know I can do this, I know I can do this.” I was not at the head or the foot; instead I was more or less in the middle, where most of the new guys started out because the head and foot had more responsibility. Because I was new, they put me in the middle, so whatever mistakes I made could be covered up. I felt that I was ready. I remember I was the only one looking out of the window because I was nervous so I was the first one to spot the hearse. I was the first one off the bus while everybody else was taking their time because they knew what they were doing. I was excited because this was my first funeral. I was so cognizant that the entire time the remains were pulling up, I was practicing in my head – okay you do this, you follow, if they say three paces, you take the three paces with no turning, and if they say four paces forward, then you take the four paces forward and then you turn in. Three paces means we walk up three paces and stop. Three paces forward means we take three paces forward and turn in. We turn in because once the hearse passes you, depending upon if it is on the right or the left, we turn either to the right or the left towards the back of the hearse. If the hearse pulled up, we would be right on top of it, since we are about four or five feet up from the hearse. We don’t want the hearse to go by and hit us, so we back away. When the hearse pulls up, then the person in charge of the group would say, “Body bearers, three paces forward.” So we would take three paces forward and then we go to parade rest. That means we had our back and then if we’re not up to the hearse, he’ll say, “Body bearers, two paces forward.” Then we go up two paces and then we automatically turn in towards the door of the hearse.

Everything is done at attention. Nobody is leaning over, because we want to maintain military precision. That’s the whole purpose of a military funeral, to let this be the last respects for this man. Nothing is done haphazardly. When the casket comes out, we make sure that the flag is on right; we make sure that the foot of the casket always goes toward the gravesite first. The head of the casket is where the blue is. So when we’re marching toward the graveside, we’re taking side-steps to get away from the hearse and then the person in charge of the funeral or of the pall bearers would nod his head so we would start walking towards the gravesite. Once we get to the gravesite, the family is following and everybody’s standing up. We had to be in shape because a lot of the times, when we would get to the gravesite, we wouldn’t just drop the casket down, we had to slowly lower the casket. Once we would get on the gravesite, we would side-step along boards would be on the gravesite and we would just half-step, or sidestep onto the gravesite. Once we were all on the board, then we would slowly lower the casket onto the gravesite, onto that platform at the gravesite. Nobody would come up until we all had our hands on the flag and then we would all come up together with the flag in hand. And that’s the way we would stay until we would get the nod from the funeral director. After Taps, after the firing party, then we would fold the flag, hand it to the funeral director who then would hand it to the family. After four months, I had lost any kind of fear about going out to Arlington. There were days when we would go out and we would have four or five funerals in one day. We’d just be jumping from section to section toward funerals. The military provided us with packed lunches, that we would eat on the bus. We would have half an hour, 45 minutes and then we would head on to the next funeral.

There were days we’d be at the cemetery with six to seven funerals. We would have a funeral every 35 or 40 minutes. I first set foot in Arlington National Cemetery in January 1963, and despite all the funerals I had participated in during that time, I never really gave death much thought. I was young and what young man thinks death is going to reach out for him? I never considered the possibility until November 22, 1963. he morning of November 22, 1963, started with having reveille at 6:00 A.M. as usual. Since it was Friday, we didn’t have any details that day. Guys would actively G.I. (clean up) the dorms. Every body went up to the third deck, on the third floor, where we have the TV room. Then we also had the muster area and the practice area where we would normally practice funerals. We would have a mock set up of the casket on a grave site where we would normally be practicing our routines. But for that day, Friday November 22^(nd) , we didn’t have any funerals or any other kind of details. So we all went up to the third deck where we would iron our uniforms and shine our shoes. It was just an area that everybody in the guard congregated to – when we didn’t have any details. But on that particular day we were up there early, watching the news on TV and preparing to go home for Thanksgiving, because it was the holiday season, Everyone that didn’t have a duty was preparing to go home for the Thanksgiving holidays. As the morning proceeded and as we got close to the afternoon, they were showing the president in Dallas and what his itinerary was going to be that day. Suddenly, there was a news flash; breaking news that President Kennedy had been shot! At that point – everything just stopped. We were all glued to the TV, even the commander and other officers that were assigned to the guard came up to the third deck. Everyone was stunned. At that time, we did not realize whether or not this was some kind of an attempt by a foreign government or somebody trying to do something to President Kennedy from a foreign country. We did not know whether he was dead or alive. The entire base went on alert, because that time was right after the Cuban missile crisis.

We didn’t realize or we didn’t know at that time if the president had been mortally wounded, just that the president had been shot. But nobody understood whether it was a body wound or a head wound. There was just somebody shooting at the president’s motorcade. I was in disbelief. Just like the rest of the guys and guards we were all young. I was probably one of the youngest in the guard. We were all glued to the TV. Every time the announcer or the broadcaster would say something, we were all hanging on. Was he okay? Was it serious? Were we going to war? Was it war? If so, with whom? The commander was up there, the executive was up there and all the other pay officers were up there. As time went on, we questioned, “Oh my god, what’s going to happen next? As the day went on, we were all upstairs. The commander and the exec went downstairs because the commander of the unit was getting calls from the military district of Washington that takes care of all big events in DC. Around 4 : 00 pm , my commander, Commander McNulty came over to the loud speaker and said, “Hugh, report to the guard office.” I had no idea why I was being summoned. When my name came over the PA system, I went down to the office and Commander McNulty said to me, “Hugh, you need to saddle up.” He didn’t say who but he said, “They will be here to pick you up.” I didn’t even ask who, what or why. I saluted him, turned and went back to my dorm area and made sure I started laying out my dress uniform, my white belt and all my brass. I started getting dressed. I didn’t know where I was going, but McNulty had said, “Saddle up and report back to the office.” It took me maybe 15 minutes. There’s a lot of preparation of white gloves, brass, and belts to make sure everything is just right. When I finished, I reported back to the guard office and McNulty told me, “Go wait down on the corner deck.

I don’t want to say I was excited, but I was nervous because I had been to Andrews Air Force Base numerous times but never for something like this. I didn’t know what part I would be playing. Would I be like an escort for dignitaries, a walk through or just be in place as part of a contingent to be present? I was down there for maybe 15 minutes and the snow patrol military police showed up. I got into the car and I said, “Where are we going?” The driver said, “Andrews Air Force Base.” When we left the base, there were no words exchanged. As we rode through DC, the streets were empty. For a Friday around Thanksgiving, this silence was unheard of. It was overcast. The sun had been out that day but now DC seemed like a ghost town. Once we arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, there were people all over the place, there were military police, men in suits, it was very crowded. He said, “Okay, I want you to fall in with these guys.” And it was James Felder, Richard Gaudreau, Bud Barnum, Tim Cheek and Doug Mayfield. I didn’t know this at first, but I learned who these fellows were in the days that followed. We were all together. Lieutenant Bird was the officer in charge. Another set of pallbearers were stationed there also. Then Lieutenant Bird said to us, “This is what’s going to happen. When the president’s plane arrives, the elevated truck is going to back up, the first set of casket team members will remove the remains from Air Force One onto the elevated truck. Then this team will remove the casket and place it in the navy ambulance.” That’s how it was supposed to go. Shortly thereafter, Air Force One came down the runway. It was maybe 20 yards from where we were standing when it stopped. The elevated truck backed up, the back door of the plane opened up, and we saw the first casket team on the truck. The elevated truck was raised and the team placed the casket on the elevated truck. As it was lowered, the navy ambulance was moved in place. We proceeded to remove the casket from the elevated truck and placed it in the ambulance. As we moved to remove the casket off the truck, all hell broke loose.

We had it three quarters off the truck, sliding it toward the end of the elevated truck. I was at the front of the casket when all of a sudden we were rushed by some civilians and General Godfrey McHugh. His exact words were, “This is my commander-in-chief.” Bud Barnum was knocked out of the way. Gaudreau was almost knocked out of the way. The casket dipped because when these people rushed from both sides of the casket, I thought we were just supposed to let them have it. When we let go, the casket dipped because they didn’t know how to handle a casket. They did not know that the shifting weight of the casket was a quarter of the way onto the truck. Once we were pushed aside, there weren’t enough of them to handle it. As the casket dipped, we were close enough to grab it and steady it and move it towards the ambulance. I was pulled aside, and they were able to push the remains into the navy ambulance. At that time I looked up and I could see Jackie Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy and other dignitaries standing on the elevated truck. I remember thinking, “Oh my god, what is she going through?” Loading the casket lasted for at least a minute because it was done so haphazardly. No one’s remains should have been treated like that, let alone the President of the United States. Once the casket was in the waiting ambulance, the door closed, and Jackie Kennedy was helped off the elevated truck. Lieutenant Bird formed us up again and I believe what he said to us was, “Oh my God.” I think one of us might have said, “We almost dropped it.” I know Lieutenant Bird was very disgusted at the way the casket had been handled. We formed up again on the side, and the ambulance, along with the dignitaries and the motorcade pulled off before President L.B. Johnson even had an opportunity to come down from Air Force One. Lieutenant Bird was getting instructions from Major General Philip Wehle, who was in charge of the Military District of Washington as to our next step. I heard Lieutenant Bird say, “This is the team that I want,” and Major General Wehle said, “Okay, let’s enter the helicopter.” We formed up, standing at attention, and we marched toward the army helicopter.

General Wehle got in first, then Lieutenant Lipsey and then the rest of the casket team. Shortly thereafter we were airborne. Lieutenant Bird sat next to me, and General Wehle sat across from me. Lieutenant Bird commented to General Wehle that we almost dropped the casket because of the intrusion of all those people that didn’t know what they were doing. General Wehle stated, “It won’t happen again. It won’t happen again.” Once we were airborne, I remember we shadowed the motorcade. I was excited and also frightened because I had never been on a helicopter before. I was looking out the windows, seeing the lights go by and saw the motorcade below us as we traveled from Andrews Air Force Base to the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Once we were near Bethesda Naval Hospital, we split off ahead and landed. I thought it was the helicopter landing area, but I couldn’t really distinguish what it was because it was dark. There was a pickup truck waiting for us in the landing area. Lieutenant Bird put us in the back of this pickup truck. General Wehle and Lieutenant Lipsey got into an official vehicle. They went one way, and we went another way. Once we got into the pickup truck, we went around the back of the hospital and came out on the right side of the hospital, the front of the hospital. We got out of the pickup truck and we formed on the right side of the main doors of the hospital. We were there for approximately 10 minutes when we saw the motorcade coming from our right side, up towards the front of the hospital. Once the motorcade and the navy ambulance went past us a little bit, we were supposed to move on to the ambulance to remove the casket. Just as the ambulance pulled up, we started to move on to the ambulance. It seemed as though there had to be maybe 100 photographers coming out of nowhere. Jackie Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy got out of the navy ambulance and went into the hospital. The photographers proceeded to rush the navy ambulance, at which point the navy ambulance took off. It just took off. Right after that happened, we proceeded to move on to the ambulance.

Lieutenant Bird’s command was, “Back to the truck.” We jumped back into the truck and started chasing the navy ambulance. We didn’t have any points of reference in terms of the ambulance. All we knew was we were in the truck chasing this navy ambulance. We could see red lights. The driver had to know the grounds better than anyone else, so he just fol- lowed the ambulance. We might have gone around the hospital twice. At that point in time, Lieutenant Bird must have gotten the word because we went back to the hospital where the navy ambulance was waiting for us. We got out of the truck and we proceeded to remove the bronze casket. We proceeded up the ramp to the back of the hospital. With James Felder in front of me, Tim Cheek to his right, I was behind Felder. Bud Barnum was behind me, and we proceeded to guide the casket out of the ambulance and up to the ramp. As we cleared the ambulance and started up the ramp, General McHugh pushed Bud out of the way grabbing the casket again. We had to maneuver in such a way because of the ramp itself. We were in between the two railings so we had to make a turn. On the first turn, we had to make a right to get up to the loading platform. We had to raise the casket, a little above the waist to clear the casket because we all couldn’t fit between the railings. Once we got it up to the upper loading dock, someone opened the back door and there was a dolly waiting for us. We had to almost turn the casket on its side just to get it in the door because six of us couldn’t fit through the door. It wasn’t one of those double doors that we could carry the casket through. So we had to turn it on its side to get it through the door and place it on the dolly. Once we got it down on the dolly, again, there were three men on each side. Lieutenant Bird was in the back, and we wheeled it down the hall and into the anteroom where we were told, “Stop right here.” We must have gotten there around 8:00.

I can remember seeing a man I later learned was the x-ray tech Jerrol Custer. I remember someone bringing food down because none of us had eaten. I remember trying to eat something I remember Lieutenant Bird came out one time and asked us if we wanted to go in and look. I said “No.” There was a point when we were inside the anteroom, that General McHugh came out and we asked him, “What’s going on in there?” He was angry and he said, “I can’t believe the way Johnson treated Mrs. Kennedy.” He was very upset about what had happened. At the time, we didn’t know what he was talking about. and looking for a good five to ten seconds, seeing the President’s body lying on the table, and to me looking like he was sleeping. I could not see any wounds. I could not see any distinguishing things that would make me believe that he was hurt or that he had been shot. But I saw him only from the waist up because there was a sheet covering his lower extremities. I remember looking at his head because they said it was a head shot. I remember his neck; it looked like his neck or his head was on a block. It was a quick ten seconds and then I looked away and closed the door. From that point on, we were taking turns, two guys would sit down, and four guys would stand guard. I don’t recall how long we had to stand guard at the doors, but I don’t think anybody was tired because everybody was so tensed up and the adrenaline was flowing. If they had told us that we had to stand up the whole night, we would have done it. We were told not to let any photographers or any unauthorized people come through the doors. We didn’t know who was authorized and who wasn’t authorized. We had guys in suits, and military generals and admirals going back and forth. We didn’t know who belonged and who didn’t belong.

Generals and admirals we knew because they were in uniform. The lead aprons identified the x-ray technicians. They belonged there. The guys with cameras were being kept back by somebody else. They weren’t even allowed around the morgue area. We couldn’t see the other people stationed in the area. We were the only guards around the morgue, just the six of us. Once the President’s body had finally been prepared for burial and was placed in the burial casket, it was around 4:00 in the morning. Lieutenant Bird made sure that there was a flag to drape over the casket. Then the casket was again brought into the anteroom. We removed the mahogany casket, placed it back into the navy ambulance, and we then got into a limousine rather than a helicopter. Once we got into the limousine, we were right behind Jackie Kennedy, right behind the family, because we had to be in a position where we were able to get out and be formed up before the ambulance got to the White House. We had a police escort because we had to speed up to get there, get out of the motorcade and then speed up again. We were really closing at a good pace. Everything was locked off on the motorcade group. People might think it’s a little strange, but the entire time there was no conversation. We were all nervous; the adrenaline was flowing. We had been up since 6:00 the previous morning. We were running on fumes. There was no conversation until Lieutenant Bird told us what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. The motorcade sped on ahead waiting for the ambulance to pull up under the overhang of the White House. We took the casket out of the navy ambulance and got it into the White House. Jackie Kennedy and the other dignitaries followed us down the hall towards the East Room. We had the casket on the dolly and we were holding it and guiding it down the hall towards the East Room of the White House. Once we got it into the East Room, we removed it from the dolly and we placed it on the catafalque. We stood guard over the casket. Jackie and Bobby Kennedy came in and we moved back from the casket and turned our backs so they could have their privacy. I think that’s when they opened the casket.

Once they left the East Room we had to stay put until the Death Watch arrived. The Death Watch is a group of personnel from each branch of the service with an officer in charge who stands guard over the remains. They switch half an hour on, half an hour off. We were the first Death Watch because the other personnel hadn’t been informed yet. So we had to stay near the remains for maybe 45 minutes before the Death Watch arrived and relieved us. We went downstairs to the floor below to the main floor of the White House and men were sitting in chairs. I was lying on the floor. We were exhausted. We each had to wait for a ride back to our respective barracks. We all needed transportation back to the Armor Guard Barracks in Anacostia. I don’t know how long we were there, but when I left the White House that morning it was daylight. After I left the White House, I went back to the naval base where I had to get my uniforms ready and try to get some sleep. I slept maybe an hour or two before I had to refurbish my uniform and my shoes. I had been up all night. I don’t even remember sleeping, between the excitement and the adrenaline. I don’t even remember the guys at the base asking me any questions. I do remember that all the phones were turned off, with no calls coming in and no calls going out. On Saturday we, the casket team, had to meet back at Arlington Cemetery. We also realized that two men had to be added because we were struggling with that casket, even with seven of us, because it was so heavy. We knew that the next day we were going to have to go up the Capitol steps to the rotunda. We met back at Arlington that evening at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where we had another casket, an empty casket that was weighted to go up and down the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier steps. We all knew this was going to be an ordeal because the Capitol steps are not wide. Going up and down one person is on the step at a time. So we had to take short steps to ensure that nobody stepped on anybody’s heel and Lieutenant Bird wanted to make sure that we were comfortable doing it.

So we had to take short steps to ensure that nobody stepped on anybody’s heel and Lieutenant Bird wanted to make sure that we were comfortable doing it. He was the type of officer who made sure that we were prepared to fulfill the task so we went up and down those steps many times. I remember the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier steps saying, “Down on the head, up on the foot,” to make sure that we had the casket leveled. We were the only people in Arlington Cemetery at that hour. The gates were closed and nobody else was going around the sections. I remember thinking, “Isn’t this something, that at night, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier steps we’re practicing to make sure we get this right.” Sunday night I tried to get some rest and made sure everything was squared away. Shoes, vest, hats, uniforms, just making sure everything was in proper order. I wanted to talk to my family, but nobody was calling in, nobody was calling out. All the phones were off the hook. None of us had the opportunity to call out or receive calls. On Monday, November 25, 1963, we made sure everything was in order, because we knew it was going to be a long day. We were going to have to go to the Capitol, bring the remains down, and then go to St. Mathew’s Cathedral. We marched both beside the caisson and behind the caisson. Then from St. Mathew’s Cathedral we had to march to Arlington National Cemetery, a very long walk. We were not afraid of dropping the casket. I think for all of us, the inner strength of all of us, were working as a team. Everything that we had learned prior to this funeral, the other funerals that we had done, and Lieutenant Bird being patient with us, making us practice, making sure that we had it down to a “t” paid off in the end. Once we got the casket down the steps, we had to be close, but could hear almost a sigh of relief. Then we had to raise the casket up and we could not bend over or squat down a little bit and push it up. Everybody at the same time had to lift as one person and raise it up and then slide it onto the caisson. In my peripheral vision, I had never seen so many people on the streets of Washington, DC. As I moved up the street, I could see the enormity of the crowd which had to be 10 or 12 feet deep.

As I moved up the street, I could see the enormity of the crowd which had to be 10 or 12 feet deep. It was amazing. I’m sure people had driven from all over the United States to be in DC for the funeral. I could hear people above the drum beat and then I heard the rest of the band kick in with the death march. I couldn’t hear anybody yelling out but I could hear people sobbing. They were literally crying as we marched by them. For me it was all about the people of DC. I wasn’t thinking about the entire world watching. The crowds were massive from what I could see peripherally, and as we marched the music was very solemn. Once we arrived at St Mathews Cathedral, the other services, the military, had performed. Then we came alongside of the caisson, and we unbuckled the straps across the casket, across the flag. Then once the music started, Hail to the Chief, we began to slide the casket off of the caisson. Once we got it off the caisson, we turned and started heading into St. Mathew’s Cathedral where Cardinal Cushing met us on the street level where he blessed the casket. Then we moved up the steps and into the foyer area of St. Mathew’s Cathedral. From what I could see St. Mathew’s Cathedral looked beautiful from the doorway. Then Sergeant Felder and I wheeled the casket down the center aisle to place it in front of the altar. Once we placed the casket on the altar, we turned it sideways. James Felder and I left the altar area and walked back out to the foyer where we waited for the mass. Once the doors opened again, after the mass was over, we went back down to the altar, and we had to turn the casket so it would come out feet first. As we went down and turned the casket, Cardinal Cushing came with the incense. He was blessing the casket again, and the incense went right up my nose. Tears came pouring down my cheek. I wasn’t crying but the incense had gotten up my nose and tears started coming down. I heard a lady say, “Look, the sailor is crying.” But I never smiled or frowned, I just let the tears roll down my cheeks and then we started out slowly down the center aisle.

When we got to the foyer area we all turned in, making sure that the flag was straight. We proceeded out of the St. Mathew’s Cathedral, as the band played Hail to the Chief. We came down the steps and were standing there holding the casket, which never got any lighter. Once we came down the steps, Cardinal Cushing blessed the remains again. Then we walked over to the caisson, turned in, raised the casket up, and slid it back onto the caisson, put the straps on, made sure that the flag was secure so wind wouldn’t blow the flag. We then lined up alongside the caisson. We waited until the family got into their motorcade. We started out for Arlington National Cemetery and from that point we didn’t realize how long or how far. The only thing we could hear was that drum beat. Then the rest of the band came in while we’re marching and the entire time we just saw this mass of people all the way to Arlington. As we marched up, we saw men dressed in the red and white uniforms of the old Revolutionary Guard. It was just beautiful. We were alongside the caisson and when the caisson slowed down, we had to march in place until it started up again. Then we moved forward, four men on each side, Lieutenant Bird behind the caisson, and we beside it. At the point the weight of the 1,300 pound casket became apparent because Cardinal Cushing and other pastors were assisting him, were moving very slowly. At one point we bumped them with the casket because we were on slippery ornamental roads around the grave site. We were trying to maintain our footing but they were moving so slowly that we felt as if we were standing still. Then when they got bumped with the casket, they sped up a little bit. Once we got up to the gravesite, we had to put the casket down. We had to bend over because we couldn’t stand up straight, because the gravesite had to be wide enough. The platform for the remains was the only thing that I really thought about, as heavy as that casket was. “I hope when we set it down that it just doesn’t drop right down.” The casket is never lowered while the family is at the gravesite. At the gravesite, we placed the President’s casket on the boards across the gravesite.

At the gravesite, we placed the President’s casket on the boards across the gravesite. Before we came back up we made sure we gripped the flag, so the flag comes up at the same time, taut, never sagging. We stood there in the cold throughout the gravesite service with our white gloves holding the brand new flag. We folded the flag, in one of the best flag folding ceremonies in which I have ever or will ever participate in. Nothing showed but that blue fold. Once it was handed over to the funeral director, he handed it to Jackie Kennedy. We couldn’t see that, but that’s the procedure, because we were looking straight ahead. One thing that I remember about the gravesite is Cardinal Cushing blessing the casket as he spoke in Latin in his unique voice while everybody listened. After the ceremony was over the family left the gravesite. We were still standing at the gravesite after all the dignitaries and everybody had left. Then The Black Knights from Ireland performed their silent drill. Through all of the ceremony we were standing there holding the flag, holding it taut. After all was done, we folded the flag. Then Mrs. Kennedy lit the eternal flame. Everybody left the gravesite and we, the Honor Guard, were the only ones standing there. We then did something unique. Lieutenant Bird marched us maybe five paces off the main gravesite. Then he had us salute. We were facing the casket or the remains and he said, “Present arms.” We gave our final salute as the casket team to the Commander in Chief. That was the last funeral I participated in at Arlington National Cemetery, the burial of President John F. Kennedy. he morning after we laid President Kennedy to rest, I was on a bus from the Port Authority in Downtown Washington on my way back home. I had finished my tour of duty in the Navy Honor Guard and I had an opportunity to reflect back on the past four days during this four hour trip. Between sleeping and waking up on the bus, I was remorseful because I didn’t have an opportunity to say goodbye to everyone. Once the funeral was over, we were so tired, Smitty1 and I went back and got some much needed sleep. Before we realized it, reveille was going off at 6:00 A.M. and we knew we had to be out.

Alone I think things started to sink in, in terms of what I had just gone through. I was feeling very proud that my last funeral just happened to be the President of the United States. It was a feeling of really doing something great for the country and for my family, but again I didn’t realize the magnitude at the time. It was just a matter of doing a good job for the Navy and for the country, but also to make my family proud. I think that the biggest thing for me was wondering how my family would react when I told them what I had done, not realizing that they had seen me on TV, because I never had an opportunity to speak to them. My dad was one of the proudest fathers in the world. He let me know because we stopped at every school I had ever attended, from the one in Patterson, New Jersey, PS 62, Mamaroneck Avenue to Mamaroneck Junior High, to my high school of fashion industry. The school hosted a special assembly for me. Then my dad took me to the Bible College where I spoke. Life was so busy and I became so exhausted that I spent the rest of my leave in St. Albans Naval Hospital. I had a bad case of strep throat. My throat had almost closed up and between the Penicillin shots every four hours to at least being able to swallow something, my life was touch and go for a while back then. The following day after I got out of the hospital, I had to report down to Charleston, South Carolina Naval Base to catch a ship to go overseas. I flew out of La Guardia Airport down to Charleston along with three other men that had been stationed in Washington. Although they were not in the Honor Guard, we knew each other because we were all on the same base. One of the men, Mugsy, was from Philadelphia. We had taken a cab from the airport to the main strip right outside the naval base when one of the men said, “Hey come on. Let’s stop and have a beer before we check in.” It was 1963. Everybody agreed to stop and have a beer, at the closest bar to the main gate. “We’ll stop and have a beer and then we’ll check in, get our sea bags; our big duffel bags with all our clothes in it.” So we went into the bar and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:32:99fa551c9651", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4643, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "airport to the main strip right outside the naval base when one of the men said, “Hey come on.

The bartender brought back three and set them in front of the three white men. I was the only black military man. So Mugsy pushed his beer down to me because I was closest to the door. I picked it up and started to drink it when the bartender slapped it out of my hand. I said, “What’d you do that for?” We started fighting in the bar and other people joined in including civilians. It was us four against the bar. It seemed we were fighting a half an hour before we heard the sirens in the background. Somebody had called the police. We grabbed our sea bags and we were about 30 yards or 40 yards from the main gate. The State Trooper walked up to the gate and he pointed at me and said “Boy, don’t ever let us catch you off this base because your momma will never see you again.” It was at that time that I really felt, “Why am I fighting for this country and I can’t even have a beer? I just buried the President of the United States and I cannot have a beer.” If there was one time where I hated being in the military, this was that one time. It made me think of the Emmett Till case and tears just started running down my cheek. I think that was one of the most devastating and angry moments that I ever felt being in the military. I remember checking in aboard ship. That was the first time that I had an opportunity to call home and speak to my father and talk to him and tell him what had happened. Being a pastor he said, “Your mom, your brothers and sisters and I are praying for your safe return.” That made me feel better, but when my family was in New York and I was in the deep South, anything can happen. I spent the rest of my tour of duty overseas. When it was time to come back home, I was having such a good time over there that I almost re-enlisted. The only reason I did not re-enlist was that all my friends back home were writing me, telling me how much fun they were having and wanting me to come home.

They had a whole lot of things planned that we were going to do. That’s what stopped me from re-enlisting and low and behold in August of 1966, I got discharged and returned to Charleston, South Carolina. I had matured and things didn’t affect me as they had when I initially went south in 1963. My attitude about the south had matured because I had grown as a person emotionally and physically. I had seen a lot overseas; I had heard a lot overseas. So when I came back life was a little different because the Civil Rights had been passed; the Voting Rights had been passed. It was a different time. It was maybe 13 days before I was discharged and I was on a plane, coming home, coming back to New York. I remember that on my first night home my mom had cooked my favorite sweet potato pie, chicken, potato salad and collard greens. She had all my favorite dishes so it was a day to remember! When I came home, I had an opportunity to take it easy. My best friend and I went on a road trip for three weeks in his dad’s blue Ford Fairlane convertible. We started in Baltimore, we went through Morgan State University first, and we partied there. Then we stopped and saw our friends who were going to the school. Then we went back in the car, went back to D.C. to Howard University and partied with our friends there. Then from Howard we went down to Campton, Virginia; then from Campton we went to North Upstate, partying with our friends. For three weeks, we just partied having a house party every night. I just figured I was all for that because I had been in the military. I was mature, and I knew how to talk to women. That was a big thing. I had a head start on the college kids because I had been around the world and when they introduced me they would say, “Oh this is Hugh, this is Hubie, and by the way, do you remember President’s Kennedy’s funeral? Well this is the guy that was carrying his casket.“ That was always a conversational piece, especially with the pretty women. After the trip was over, I returned to New York and I had already taken the Police Exam but the class hadn’t started yet.

After the trip was over, I returned to New York and I had already taken the Police Exam but the class hadn’t started yet. After I left the military and after some thought, I decided to becomea cop. It was a civil service job that would include a good pension career. I had never gone back to Great Lakes to finish electronics school. I didn’t really have a trade and after being in the military, my interest in being a tailor or designer was gone. I had a couple of friends that were cops in the neighborhood, and I started talking to them about their profession. They sold me on it, but before the class had even started I decided to take a job at the UN, for the General Assembly. I found out the UN was looking for investigators, so I went in and applied and was hired as an investigator. I met a lot of dignitaries, sitting in at the Security Council. My eyes were opened to different cultures coming together. Diplomats would argue fiercely, in the Security Council or in one of the other meetings, but as soon as it was over they walked out hugging each other, and shaking hands. I got to know some of them who invited me to parties around Christmas time. I was invited to some of the parties that they had at the UN and being able to take a girlfriend with me to the party was very impressive to women. With pictures of the President’s funeral hanging on the walls and with all the dignitaries that were there, I was able to point out, “That was me in the Navy.” That became a conversational piece. Whenever they introduced me at a party, whenever we went to an Embassy party, every time somebody new came in they announced, “This is Ambassador so and so from” – and then they announced me as Officer Clark, US Navy who was President John F. Kennedy’s Pallbearer. It was really a good experience for me. People would say, “You’re kidding, really?” It started a whole conversation with people. Even to this day, people that know me when I’m introduced to someone always say, “This is Hugh, he lives down by the garden and by the way you know he was…” and again it starts a whole conversation.

So I passed the police exam and joined the NYPD. I had just entered the police academy, when one of my instructors, Sergeant Baumet, started talking about all the jobs that the New York City Police Department did and didn’t do at the time and what they were involved in as far as heads of State that came into New York and what he had done as a police officer. He chose to talk about the Kennedy funeral. He told how a contingent of New York City Police Department policemen were shipped down to Washington DC because many dignitaries had come into town and the police wanted to ensure they had tight security. I raised my hand, “I was there also, as a matter of fact I have pictures of the funeral.” I said, “When I go home, I’m going to look and see if I can find you in any of the pictures.” That night after school I went home and I found him in one of the pictures. The next day I made a copy for him. I took the picture to the academy and said “Sarge, I have a surprise for you.” I showed him the picture. He freaked out. He was probably one of the happiest cops I’d ever seen. He ran over to the Police Academy and showed that photograph to everybody. As a result of that picture, he took a special liking to me. Having him as a friend, gave me a bit of an edge. When you’re in the academy, you need all the edge you can get. As we walked around in our uniforms people were scared to death because they thought you were going to pull out your gun and shoot them. Because we didn’t have the training we were probably more frightened than they were. In New York when you’re a rookie you wear different uniforms so that you are very distinguishable between the regular cops and rookie cops. I had been in the military and I was used to discipline. I knew how to carry myself, and I had handled weapons before. So this wasn’t scary for me. I actually grew up in the street; I wasn’t a guy that stayed in the house. I knew the city.

Once I completed the academy, I got assigned to my first home precinct, a place called Fort Apache, the Bronx – the 41. Up in the Bronx on Simpson Street, it was one of the worst precincts in the city. It was wintertime, but we had not been cops long enough to get our overcoats. I remember my first shift was on Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, it was a midnight-to-eight shift. Buildings were burned out, it was high crime area. The only thing that saved me that one night was the cold. There were not many people out on the street on the midnight-to-eight shift. I remember standing on the corner, right outside of a Western Union. I went in that Western Union every ten minutes to warm up. I would stand in there and the Western Union guy would say, “Come on in. There’s a cot in the back. All of the guys come in here and take a nap.” I said, “Really?” Then he said, “Yes, the Sergeant knows.” I remember I was in there trying to get warm and the Sergeant came by to sign my book but I wasn’t out there. Every hour, the supervisor came by to sign the book asking, “Is everything okay? Do you have anything to report? Is anything suspicious?” Just to make sure that everything was okay on the posts. When I got back to the precinct, I was frozen stiff, and I asked the precinct captain, “Can I go on vacation?” I had friends that were cops in the neighborhood who talked me into wanting to be a cop. When I walked into the precinct after my shift was over and I asked him about vacation, he said, “What’s your name?” I had been a beat cop for exactly one night. The guys who had talked me into being a cop pulled strings and got me transferred. They knew I was good. They knew I’d been in the military. They knew my background. We were in this unit because I always showed them to be equals. They had submitted my name for the unit. That first night I thought to myself, “Whoa. Thank you Jesus for that.” My friends had been the answer. The unit was comprised of street guys, with Afros and beards.

We were all cops, but we looked young back then. The purpose of the unit was to infiltrate subversive organizations and gather intelligence. Then we would take it back to the office and submit it for the officers or the bosses to evaluate, to determine what was going on in the city as far as subversive organizations. Back then there were the SDS, Students for a Democratic Society, the Weathermen, the Black Panthers, the Black Liberation Army, and many subversive organizations that were rebelling against the establishment. Our job everyday was to ride in unmarked cars. These cars could be gypsy cabs or other trucks or vans. We would disperse throughout the city where there was subversive activity taking place: Washington Square Park, Bryant Park, the village area, and all of the five boroughs. Every day we would go out gather this intelligence, write it down, keep daily records and take it back to headquarters. It would be evaluated and determined where the next hot-spot would be, where the next demonstration would be. These weren’t just Black or White radicals, they were any radical, even if it was mixed. Out on the West Coast there was the Symbionese Liberation Army. Those were the types of organizations that we would try to infiltrate to gather intelligence. Sometimes we were in deep cover, not just undercover but deep cover. We had Afros and beards, and we tried to fit into that environment. That’s what the chief of detective special unit was like. We didn’t go out to make an arrest. We went out to gather intelligence. I stayed there for three years until I got drafted into undercover narcotics. My memories of working undercover narcotics are vivid. We were working Manhattan South and my partner and I were out making buys. Our jobs were to go out and make buys from people selling drugs. We would go out and we would make a buy. We would buy on Monday, buy on Tuesday, and we would lay off and do paperwork on Wednesday. Then on Thursday and Friday, we would get in our car and go out looking for the people we had bought from. We would have a walkie-talkie in the car and we had the back-up team that was working in the street with us. We never went out without a backup team in case something happened.

We would have a walkie-talkie in the car and we had the back-up team that was working in the street with us. We never went out without a backup team in case something happened. One of the many interesting cases we were working on was in the Manhattan South district, down on Rutledge and Stanton Street. My partner, whose street name was Caesar, went into this door down in Manhattan around Rutledge Street where the guy was telling him, “Hey, come on in. We’re selling heroin inside this door.” Back then the addicts used to take all the copper off the doors and the plumbing to sell to get drug money. My partner went into this house on Rutledge Street but it was a set up, and he didn’t realize that when he went in. Three more guys were inside looking to take him out. The guy said to him, ”Under the steps, go under the steps,” and he went back there and made his buy, or what he believed to be his buy. They pulled a knife on him. Undercover agents do not carry an ID card or shield, instead they tuck it inside their pants. If drug dealers are patting the agent down, they are not going to find his shield. Caesar had left his ID card in his wallet. They had him up against the wall and I was outside up the block, waiting for him to come out when all of a sudden we heard all this gunfire. They tried to rip him off and started to stab him but he spun the guy that was trying to stab him and at the same time pulled his gun out and started firing. Since the dealers used to take all the door knobs off the doors, when they were trying to get out of the door, everybody was trying to get their fingers in the little holes for the knob and he was just firing away! Another time we got into a gun fight up on Southern Boulevard and Hoe Avenue where a guy tried to rip me off. The back-up team came when they saw me running with my gun out chasing this guy. They came and pursued the guy while I was maybe 20 feet behind him. When he turned around to fire, I was getting ready to shoot when a civilian came walking by. Just as the civilian got between us, I pulled up my gun and my bullet hit the wall where the guy’s head had been. Initially I said, “Oh my God,” because I thought I almost hit the civilian.

I think if I had not pulled up, I would have shot the civilian in the head. When I left narcotics after three years, I received my gold shield, my detective shield, and I went to the 83 squad. I became a precinct detective. The 83 squad was located on Wilson and Dekalb. Now as detectives, we investigated rapes, homicides, burglaries, anything that lead you to the investigation. Any type of investigative duties, we did. That’s where I learned how to be an investigator. I stayed with the NYPD for 22 years. I returned to college because I wanted to do something a little safer, as I got older and I wanted to help people in a different way. Unlike a lot of my fellow police detectives, what I saw on the street, the shooting and the drug deals had not changed my feeling on humanity. retired in 2008 after being a drug and alcohol counselor and administrator for many years. My daughter graduated from the University of Florida and then moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Both my wife and I wanted to be near our only child, and after retiring, we decided to make the move to Atlanta. It’s a move my wife and I have never regretted. The people are friendly, the heat has been good for my old bones, and I have plenty of time for my passion of golf. My memories of my time in the Navy where I, with the help of my comrades, laid to rest the 35^(th) President of the United States, my time as a New York detective, and my time as a drug and alcohol counselor seemed very far away. Occasionally, on an anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination, I would get a call from a newspaper reporter or someone wanting me to do a radio interview about my experiences on that tragic weekend of November 22, 1963. I would sometimes acquiesce to their requests. Always, there were the many letters with the request for me to autograph a picture of me with the rest of the honor guard carrying Kennedy’s casket to Arlington National Cemetery.

I knew I had a small place in history because I was involved in John F. Kennedy’s funeral. It had opened doors for me over the years, and at the very least, it made me the center of attention at cocktail parties, I felt I had been a small cog in the wheel in the history of that event – really just doing the job my country had required of me, as hundreds of people had done on that sad weekend so long ago. In the winter of 2014, I received a phone call which would lead to a change in my understanding of John Kennedy’s assassination and my role in its aftermath. A call that would make me question whether I and the others that carried the display casket into the morgue at Bethesda, Maryland, were used in the orchestration of a ruse – a ruse to leave a fake version of history, in essence, a lie that has persisted for 53 years. String theory suggests that time is a fluid thing. It can flow forwards or backwards. I don’t know if that’s really true, but when I received a call from a man named Phil Singer in 2014, I felt as if I had been dragged back 5 decades in time. Phil introduced himself as a “truth seeker” in the assassination of JFK. He told me he had been a member of Mark Lane’s citizen’s commission of inquiry, when he was a teenager. (I had no idea who Mark Lane was at the time, but doing my own research, now I do.) Singer said he had tracked me down through the Internet, and with some research, had found my phone number. He wanted to know what I remembered the night my fellow servicemen and I had carried Kennedy’s casket into the morgue at Bethesda. I told Phil about meeting Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, helping to unload the casket off the lift at the door of the plane, putting it in the ambulance, the ride in the helicopter, shadowing the motorcade, arriving at Bethesda, Maryland, a good 15 minutes before the motorcade itself arrived, being told by Lieutenant Bird to get into the back of a pickup truck after the ambulance took off at a fast rate, how we tried to follow it but lost it in the cold darkness of the night. Phil seemed quite interested in that part of my memories, saying “So you lost the ambulance?” I continued to tell Phil Singer the rest – about finally connecting with the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:41:e9e3f20f600b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4652, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "Bethesda, Maryland, a good 15 minutes before the motorcade itself arrived, being told by Lieutenant Bird to get into the back of a pickup truck after the ambulance took off at a fast rate, how we tried to follow it but lost it in the cold darkness of the night.

I wasn’t sure. I couldn’t remember at that time and then I told Singer about having to guard the doors to the morgue. I casually mentioned that while opening the morgue door for Dr. Berkley, I was able to see inside the morgue and saw President Kennedy’s body on the morgue table. The lower half of Kennedy’s body was covered by a sheet. “Kennedy looked like he was sleeping, except his neck had some sort of block under it making his chest lift up a little.” Singer wanted to hear the whole tale, the night at the morgue, the next day’s events, preparing ourselves to carry the very heavy casket Kennedy was to be buried in, my practicing at night going up and down the steps at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with a weighted casket in order to get the feel for what we would have to do while carrying Kennedy’s casket up the church steps for his memorial, and, of course, carrying his casket up and down the Capitol steps and the long walk to Arlington National Cemetery. I did my best to tell him all he wanted to know. Then Phil Singer surprised me by saying, “I have a friend who is a writer and filmmaker; his name is William Law and we are thinking about bringing people that were involved in President Kennedy’s autopsy together. We were thinking that if we could find the other members of Kennedy’s honor guard we would invite all of you to come together for a reunion of sorts. We would record the event on film, for history, and it would be something you could pass down to your families. Would you be interested?” I had to wait about two seconds before I answered Phil with a “yes.” The thought of seeing some of the men I had met so long ago and had been part of history with appealed to me and I thought it really would be something to participate in if the event was going to be filmed for history – and it would, of course, be something to pass onto my family.

Singer told me I was the first of the honor guard members he had contacted. We agreed we would both try to locate the other members and see what we could come up with. Over a period of weeks, Phil and I were both able to find and talk to almost all of the rest of the surviving members of the Kennedy casket team. The plan was to set a date that would be compatible for everyone. We were able to contact Tim Cheek in Florida, James Felder in South Carolina and Doug Mayfield and Bud Barnum in California. We unfortunately were not able to find Richard Gaudreau. I knew that Lieutenant Commander Bird had passed away years before due to injuries he sustained while serving in Vietnam. I was to find, with great sadness that Larry Smith and Jerry Diamond, the two men that were added later to the casket team to help with the events at the Kennedy funeral due to the sheer weight of the barrel casket, had also passed away in the intervening years. It had been decided that the event where we would all get together for the film project would be held in Chicago in the suburb of Westmont. Unfortunately, as the event was being scheduled, Bud Barnum had another commitment and couldn’t attend and Doug Mayfield had to bow out for health reasons. I was disappointed that all of the guys from the honor guard would not be able to attend the meeting in Chicago. But still, there would be Tim Cheek and James Felder and something that really intrigued me, the promise that some of the guys that had been inside the morgue helping with Kennedy’s autopsy would also be there. Richard Lipsey, with whom Phil had been in contact over a period of several months, had said he might come, but his attendance was up in the air. As it turned out, Lipsey did show up for part of the Chicago event, and I must say his participation turned out to be rather bizarre. Finally, Phil Singer and William Law set the date. We would all meet in Westmont, Illinois, on February 2^(nd) , 3rd and 4^(th) , 2015. I grew more and more excited as the days passed, getting closer to seeing men I had not seen in fifty-one years.

I made sure I packed warm clothes as the weather report said that Chicago was going to be cold. As luck would have it, two feet of snow fell in Chicago the Tuesday before I was to fly out. My big brother, who has been a father figure to me since our father passed away, said, “Be careful. You know there are folks that don’t want the truth to come out. Just tell what you know – set the record straight.” My wife had parting words for me as well: “Be careful, you don’t know these people. If this turns out to be some sort of media event, you don’t know who’s going to be paying attention.” My wife had read more things about JFK’s assassination over the years then I had, and we had all seen things on TV, but I could hardly believe that I would have all this contact with two men, who over a period of months, while trying to get a group of us together, would try to do us harm. I will say this: what I learned at the meeting in Westmont, Illinois, and my own private research since, has made me give more credence to my family’s warnings. The man who picked me up by prearrangement (Phil Singer had thought ahead about everything we would need during the visit, including the participant’s being picked up and delivered to the hotel) escorted me into the lobby. He told me, “Phil and William are in the room,” pointing the way. Stepping into the room, I had been directed to, was like stepping back into the 60s. There were two men sitting in hardback metal folding chairs casually talking to each other. One was bald, wearing glasses, clean shaven, and looking like an older version of a college football player – which I found out later, he had been. The other man was dressed casually in a long sleeved blue pullover sweater and jeans. His long gray hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and he sported a close cropped beard of the same color. They both noticed me at the same time and stood up to greet me. The fellow with the beard and ponytail turned out to be William Law, and, of course, I recognized Phil Singer as soon as he spoke.

As soon as we had greeted one another, one of them said, “Let’s get our cameraman in here to film right now.” They had me sit down in one of the many chairs that were in the room – the room had not yet been set up for filming and there was a certain amount of disarray in the furnishings. A man with a video camera seemed to appear out of nowhere. Phil and William started asking me questions and I told them how it all started for me. I told them about the helicopter ride, shadowing the motorcade – the ambulance taking off in the crush of reporters and picture takers jumping in the back of the pickup truck, having to go around the facility, finally finding the ambulance and taking the President’s casket into the Bethesda morgue, and then guarding the morgue doors in shifts. Phil asked me at one point during the filming to go into another part of the room and asked me to stand at one of the doors to demonstrate how I was guarding the morgue door and how I was able to look in and see the president’s body lying on the morgue table. Phil asked me to describe what Law said “Maybe not exactly like this, but,” holding the block up I said “Yeah, but it’s shaped like this.” Again, I demonstrated by putting it behind my neck. “Not his head,” I told them, moving the block to the back of my head, “but like this,” moving the chock back behind my neck. “It raises the body up,” and I tilted my head back. “It raises the upper chest so that when they do the “Y” incision, it’s almost like that,” I said, raising my chest up even more. I tilted my head and body way back in the chair I was sitting in to demonstrate what putting a block behind a deceased person’s neck would do to the chest area. I told them I had become familiar with what a chock block looked like when I was a police officer in New York and had to be in the morgue from time to time. I told them about seeing someone bringing in the President’s burial suit, seeing the mahogany burial casket when the casket was delivered and the body was ready, wheeling the casket out of the morgue on a gurney, putting it in the ambulance, getting back into the pickup truck and following the ambulance back to the White House.

I was answering a question posed by William about the casket, after he read from the book, The Death of a President, describing how we had taken the casket out of the ambulance, when I saw Tim Cheek come through the door.

Tim looked just as I remembered him. His hair had thinned on top, and he had gone gray. He was older, as was I, but he still had the military bearing of the Marine he once was. We talked about the flight in, and how cold the weather was. William finally managed to get us to sit down together. Sitting across from Tim Cheek and me, William said to Tim:, “I apologize for doing this, because you just walked in and sat down, just having seen each other after 51 years.” Tim and I sat back and waited for William’s question. “I was just asking Hubie about the casket entry [into the Bethesda Naval Hospital]. Holding up the book, The Death of a President, by a man named William Manchester, Law said, “This supposedly gives the official version, and I wanted to read it to you and get your thoughts on it.” He said, “Let me tell you. The Death of a President written by William Manchester, The Kennedys hired him to write the official biography of everything that happened [that weekend]. There came to be problems down the road and they got into a big fight. Supposedly, when Manchester was writing this book, this was the writer’s interpretation. He was allowed to talk to all the Kennedy’s, people that knew the Kennedy’s, so he was basically the first person to write what this…” The muddle was the consequence of a failure in interservice communication. The Army had been as vigilant as the Navy; General Wehle stationed himself beyond the cornerstone in a staff car, with Lieutenant Bird and his body bearers right behind him in a truck. They had observed Mrs. Kennedy’s arrival, but the darkness, the great blocks of silent people, and the many moving vehicles distracted them. It had confused two Naval physicians, too.

When an ambulance drew away from the curb they called, “That’s it—we’ll guide you to the morgue.” At the morgue Wehle, Bird and the six enlisted men debarked and inspected each other’s uniforms while awaiting some movement from the ambulance. It was still as still. The Lieutenant crept up and peered inside. It was empty. Even the driver had gone. Panicky, they fled back and saw, among the shining cat’s eyes, the uneasy face of Godfrey McHugh. Wehle and Bird colored. The military District of Washington was meticulous about ceremony; for a casket team to leave a Commander in Chief ’s casket was an astounding lapse, and after casting about bitterly – and vainly – for the two doctors, they re-formed the tiny escort The morgue was fronted by a concrete jetty approached along the left side by a short flight of cement steps. Since coffins were the most precious burden to pass this way the stairs should’ve been designed for them. They weren’t. They were too narrow, and a steel handrail was an impediment to bearers. The railing thwarted the gesture of McHugh’s. This once, he thought, it would be appropriate for a general to join hands with five enlisted men, and relieved the Coast Guardsmen in the team. But navigating the ponderous Bri- tannia required exceptional dexterity on the left. McHugh was too old. He tried, and kept trying until his eyes filled with frustration. It was no use. He was holding them all up, and motioning to the lanky Coast Guard youth he capitulated. The others moved quickly then, inside and sharp left through the double brown doors labeled “RESTRICTED – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.” Lieutenant Bird decided that he wasn’t an authorized person. After his men had lowered the casket to a wheeled gurney he shepherded them into the corridor and mounted guard. Two Navy corpsman pass, rolling a litter. Nothing appeared to be on it except the small lump wrapped in sheeting. “What’s that?” he inquired. “Baby. Born dead,” one mumbled. The Lieutenant whispered, “Oh.” It occurred to him that Bethesda wasn’t going to be at all like Arlington. Tim and I listened carefully. Law finished reading. Tim said “Well, I remember going up [the steps] with the hand railing in the way. I remember us having to that we were at first – could not find the casket it wasn’t where we thought it would be.

As to all of that, I don’t remember a general… the lanky coast guard youth, that would have been [Bud] Barnum.” Tim and I had talked about this prior to coming to Chicago. I said, “Do you remember when we were standing in front of the hospital waiting for the ambulance to pull up? We had taken a helicopter from Andrews Air Force Base, so we were waiting for the ambulance to pull up, and as the ambulance pulled up, reporters and flashbulbs came from everywhere and the ambulance took off!” I looked at Tim and chuckled. “And that’s when Lieutenant Bird said, “Hop in the truck!” And we were chasing it around the grounds. We were in sight of the ambulance for the first couple of minutes and then we lost it. I was thinking to myself, ‘’Why is this ambulance going so fast?” There wasn’t a lot of light or anything. It was like they were trying to lose us. We went around the complex and when we saw the loading dock there was someone out there and Lieutenant Bird stuck his head out and said, “Did you see an ambulance go by?” and the guy on the dock said, “No.” We went back to the hospital and the ambulance wasn’t there, so we went back around again to the back of the hospital at the loading dock, and the ambulance was there at the loading dock. I don’t know where it had driven off to previously or what route the ambulance driver had taken, but it should have been there during our first time following it to the back of the hospital, but it wasn’t.” William asked Tim to tell of his memories of us losing the ambulance. “I remember it wasn’t where it was supposed to be when we first got there. As to whether it was lost, I don’t know.” Tim used his fingers to make air quotes. “Either it wasn’t where it was supposed to be or we weren’t where we were supposed to be. We had gotten in a truck or something and we During the session with Singer and Law, after Tim and I shared our memories of those four tragic days, I decided to take my things another of my honor guard brothers was there.

As with Tim Cheek, seeing Felder took me right back to the night of November 22, 1963, when we first met climbing aboard the waiting helicopter at Andrews Air Force Base. Felder looked … well, like Felder. He had aged gracefully, and like Tim, his hair was thinning on top, he was older but the only real difference was that his upper lip was now adorned with a mustache. We had time to reminisce for a bit before we all retired to our rooms to rest and await the other members that were supposed to join us. Many of them I already knew by their names: Dennis David, James Metzler and James Jenkins. One more that was supposed to join us was not an honor guard brother, but a man who had ridden with us on the helicopter ride to the hospital from Andrews Air Force Base, Richard A. Lipsey, who was the aide to General Wehle. I learned later that his participation was in question right up until the last moment, as was Jim Metzler’s, but they were here, and that’s all that really mattered to me. I peered down the length of the tables that had been put together so all of us could sit together. I sat at the end of the table with Phil and William and my new friend Jim Jenkins. Dennis David was sitting further down the table with his wife Marion as was Tim and his wife DeeDee. James Felder sat amongst them, along with the camera crew that had been hired to film the next day’s events. There were people to take still pictures as well. All in all, it was quite a crowd. Arrangements had been made to have dinner at one of Phil’s favorite pizza joints. It was after all, Phil’s home turf and he had gone to great lengths to make sure we were all comfortable. It was a good opportunity to renew old acquaintances and meet new ones. I really couldn’t believe I was sitting at a table with people I hadn’t seen in over five decades who were such an important part of my life and part of the history of this country. Meeting with the other men from the honor guard was my reason for leaving the sunshine of Atlanta, Georgia, for the 18 degree temperature of Chicago.

Not to mention those who had passed on, Jerry Diamond and Larry Smith, and of course, Lieutenant Bird, to make it truly a reunion of the Kennedy Honor Guard. During my brief first visits with Dennis David and his wife Marian, both I figured were in their late 70’s, I found Dennis to be smiling and good-natured, as was his wife. They sat together at the dinner table, holding hands. Jim Metzler I found to be a quiet person with an easy smile that put me at ease immediately. James Jenkins was so quiet that I sometimes had to lean forward to hear him when he spoke. He had a genuine smile and had a very warm personality. Richard Lipsey, all these years later, too looked the same to me, just an older version of the man I held in memory. I found him in animated conversation with Tim and DeeDee and a fellow named Glen Bybee, one of the photographers. The festivities lasted late into the evening. It was decided at the end of dinner to take pictures of those of us that were at Bethesda Naval Hospital that night, 51 years before. A toast was given to the “Bethesda seven.” It was decided by group consensus that we would not sleep in. We would get an early start in the morning and would all gather early the next morning to discuss what we each had experienced while on duty that night of November 22, 1963. Despite the excitement, it had been a long day and when we all returned to the hotel I went straight to my room, got undressed, turned back the bed covers, climbed in and slept like the dead. The next morning, two tables had been put together into an inverted V. Tim sat at the end, to the left of Dennis David. David sat next to me, Jim Jenkins sat to my left, and Jim Metzler sat next to Jenkins, on the right. Next was Richard Lipsey, and sitting at the other end of the V was James Felder. Phil Singer and William Law sat towards the back of the room. There were tall lights set up to illuminate the table where we sat.

As it turned out, Lipsey spoke first as he had to leave our group early to catch a plane to where he lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Lipsey showed a short presentation that he had on his laptop computer that he had brought with him. I felt a little strange sitting there while it played, but what could I do but go with the flow? Lipsey talked about where he was when he heard the news that the President had been shot and what he did at the Kennedy funeral. My ears perked up when he started talking about the honor guard – and climbing aboard the helicopter. “We went to Fort McNair. Our Chief of Staff had already pulled together the team, our team, and slowly but surely over the next 30 to 40 minutes, teams from everywhere: the third infantry of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Navy, all the heads of those ceremonial people came and that’s where we sat at Fort McNair. All afternoon waiting word for what time they would ship the body back, and I think they were even planning to send an honor guard to Texas, but it never happened because they left Parkland as you know, and went straight back out on the airplane and started home and that’s when we got the ETA [estimated time of arrival] around 6:30 or so, somewhere around there. That’s when we headed out. By then, we had the facts of what we had to do. They had told us that the autopsy would be done at the hospital – Bethesda Naval Hospital. So, we had the parade route planned out and we got into that banana helicopter – I call it banana, the big helicopter – [Lipsey rotated his hands and twirled his fingers of his hands for emphasis] I didn’t know it was going to have that many people in it – it ended up having the Third Infantry Honor Guard, the General [Wehle] and myself and the Marine Honor Guard. The Marines had 14 or 15 members of the Marine Honor Guard, and that thing was huge.” This bit of information fit nicely with what I remembered and I was now glad that Richard Lipsey had gone first out of our group. Lipsey continued, “[during my presentations] I talk a little bit about what I did at the autopsy, I don’t talk about what I saw, because there is no reason to get into that kind of detail.

To me, that’s always been kind of confidential. I’ve talked about it more among friends and different things, and there has been some different quotes [from me]. Of course you can listen to what I said to the HSCA, you know, afterwards. I’m not sure all who had to sign it, but somebody from the State Department came into the autopsy room – I sat there during the autopsy and waited for Gawler’s funeral home to come in, and then sat there the whole time Gawler’s put him back together- and I signed a statement that I wouldn’t say anything for 15 years of what I saw in that room and so I didn’t. “ Lipsey continued, “Fifteen years and maybe one or two days later I went down to my office at eight in the morning to open up and there was a black sedan parked in front and two guys got out of the sedan and said, ‘Are you Richard Lipsey?’ I said ‘Yes.’ They said, ‘We’re from the HSCA and we want to interview you about the autopsy [of President Kennedy]’. Well, it’s been 15 years, they told me not to talk to anybody about it, it totally caught me off guard, you have got to remember details [from] 15 years ago when you really purposely have put it out of your mind.” (Lipsey had interlocked the fingers of both of his hands and was holding them up off the table in front of him for emphasis), because that wasn’t very – I’m sure to all of you that had anything to do with it [Lipsey now folded his arms across his chest] that experience was a very personal experience – that’s what I treasured, not the horrible incident that a president was shot, but to be part of those four days, having known him while I was in Washington, and I saw him so many times. So, anyhow, I wanted to record it [meeting with the men from the HSCA] you know, because… and they said ‘Fine, but we’re going to record it too.’” Lipsey seemed amused telling us this, smiling and chuckling. “So they went out to the car, they got a tape recorder, recorded it, so”… [Lipsey looked out at the people in the darkened back part of the room where Law, Singer and Robert Groden and some others sat, and nodded his head towards them.] “I’m sure everybody", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:52:77fe8cf30660", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4663, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "record it [meeting with the men from the HSCA] you know, because… and they said ‘Fine, but we’re going to record it too.’” Lipsey seemed amused telling us this, smiling and chuckling. “So they went out to the car, they got a tape recorder, recorded it, so”… [Lipsey looked out at the people in the darkened back part of the room where Law, Singer and Robert Groden and some others sat, and nodded his head towards them.] “I’m sure everybody here has listened to it. I didn’t even remember … I listened to it years ago. I don’t even remember what I said during that thing. I was in kind of a state of shock.” I sat there fascinated by Lipsey, sharing some of his memories of what had happened after we took the body of the President to the White House. I had been there for most of that, so it wasn’t all that important to have Richard tell me about it. Despite Lipsey telling us he never discussed with people about what he had seen in the morgue, he did share a bit of what he experienced. “After the autopsy, I was still sitting in the room, but I’d gone out and gone to the bathroom and I came back in and General Wehle came down [Lipsey put his head back and looked up at the ceiling, raising his hands] and handed me a hamburger and a Coke.” Richard looked at all of us with a “can you believe it?” expression on his face. Some of our group chuckled and with amusement in his voice. Lipsey said, “Here I am, sitting in an autopsy room, looking at the President of the United States on that table, and he hands me a hamburger. I’d never seen a dead man before, much less the president of the United States! I admit – it wasn’t very appetizing, but at that point, I stepped out in the hall and ate the hamburger and went back in the morgue and then I watched Gawler’s funeral home prepare the President’s body.” Richard then claimed that he helped Gawler’s dress the President’s body and help put him in the casket. I didn’t know what to think when I heard Richard Lipsey tell us that, but he had been in the morgue and I had not, so who was I to say? Law directed that James Felder tell his story next, and after him, Dennis David. I didn’t really know who Dennis David was. I knew that Law had brought them into the “reunion” but all I knew besides that was that he had something to do with the morgue. David told us where he grew up, how he wanted to be in the military and how he came to be stationed at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

Felder and Lipsey seemed to be paying very close attention to what Dennis was telling us, from what I remember from the looks on their faces. Tim, sitting to Dennis David’s right, had an impassive look on his face. Then I heard Dennis David say, “I had six or seven men off my duty station and had them report to me over at the main building. I assigned them different spots and gave them the information of what the Secret Service had stated. Then about 6:30, I got a call that said, ‘Your visitor is on his way, we need help to offload.’” I noticed at this point in Dennis David’s narrative, Felder and Lipsey were listening intensely, as was Jim Metzler. Jenkins was sitting quietly as was Tim Cheek, and I didn’t know what to think. Then came this: “I had been called over to the barracks again, I had three men left from my duty section, so then I called the chief of the day of the dental school, we happened to be pretty good friends,” and I said, ‘I need some help. Have you got any extra men?’ He said, “How many do you need?” I said, ‘Three would be great.’ He said: ‘Where do you want them?’ I said, ‘I want them on the jetty down at the morgue ASAP.’ He said, ‘They’ll be there.’” Dennis continued, “I then went down, which took maybe five or six minutes to get them from where I was at, and before I could get all the way down there, the six Navy people who I needed, were gathering [within] minutes, three or four minutes. After they arrived, a black hearse pulled in, and five or six men in suits got out of the ambulance or the hearse in the back.” Dennis answered, “No, it was a wooden platform. It was a loading dock about 40 inches off the ground. And they slid this shipping casket up to it. I had my men line up, pick it up, walk through the outside door entrance to the morgue, and about – 10 feet down perhaps [there were] double doors, they opened up, they carried this gray casket in and set it down on the dock.” Dennis went on to tell us that he sent his men off back to their barracks.

He then described the men who had been driving the black hearse as being dressed in “scrubs.” “They weren’t military. Their clothes, the pants they had on were not uniform, and their shoes were neat. I just had the feeling they were not military [men].” David said that he talked to the driver of the hearse and he told Dennis David, ‘We came up 10^(th) Street, picked up Jones Bridge Road and came in the back way.’ David then told us that the entrance to Jones Bridge Road ran right by the officer’s club. I was confused. A gray shipping casket? We the Honor Guard had delivered John F. Kennedy’s body to the back of the loading dock to the Bethesda morgue at 8 P.M. We did not take the casket out of a black hearse – we had taken it out of a gray navy ambulance. I thought, “What in the hell is this guy talking about? Are you kidding me?” David started to say something else, but I interrupted with, “When you said that the men who were assigned to you, were they in blues or were they in hospital whites or…? Phil Singer, who was leading the discussion for now said, “Because I think this will help; my understanding is that we are talking about three caskets, and let me describe them – just kind of hear me out. Dennis, there is a plain [metal ] box shipping casket, which is not ceremonial, it’s not what you would see at a funeral, it’s just for transporting a body back from Vietnam like in the 60’s.” Dennis nodded in the affirmative. “Exactly,” Phil Singer continued, “that’s one type of casket and you saw that, and your six guys saw that?” funeral home – we see that loaded on Air Force One at Love Field in pictures – and we see it being unloaded at Andrews Air Force base into the gray navy ambulance and driven to Bethesda. That’s the second casket, and that’s the one with the damaged handle. Are we all in agreement?” We all nodded our heads. “The third is from Gawler’s funeral home, and that’s the big mahogany casket that weighed more than any casket ever carried in your life.

It was clearly bigger and heavier than the bronze casket with the broken handle, and it was clearly not the shipping casket.” The get together in Chicago, Westmont to be exact – a suburb of Chicago – lasted one day. The session was long, lasting for many hours, late into the night. Most of us were scheduled to leave early the next day. Richard Lipsey left early in the session to catch his flight back to Louisiana. During a break Lipsey announced he had to leave. As he was leaving, despite all he had heard, he said, “I know there are some disagreements along the way about [the assassination] of Kennedy, but I will go on the record that he was shot from behind by Lee Harvey Oswald, twice in the head [Lipsey took his right hand and placed it on the right back part of his own head] and in the back and there is no hesitation in my mind or the doctors, who shot Kennedy. Now if there was a conspiracy – I don’t think there was one – that’s my personal opinion. I think he was a nut, and I can’t… I’ve never found anyone who could trace it to anybody that guys, you know, that anybody else shot – that somebody else put Oswald up to it – but it could be, who knows? Kennedy was shot from behind by Lee Harvey Oswald, and there is every evidence in the world, to place it and not enough to displace it. Like Vince Bugliosi told me [Lipsey pronounced it Bellaougosie] there are 244 conspiracy theorist groups in the country, and every one of them think they are right. They all have a different opinion.” With a shrug of his shoulders, Lipsey shook hands with William and Phil Singer, he said a few more words to the three of us left at the table, poured himself a glass of water and was gone.1 I was confused how Richard Lipsey could be the same man who uttered “there’s something rotten in Denmark” to the HSCA members who came to see him and his company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who seemed to have doubts about events compared to the man we all met in Westmont Illinois. He so firmly believed Lee Oswald acted alone. (6:35 P.M) military time based on the testimony of Dennis David, who gave orders to six or seven enlisted men.

The enlisted men unloaded a metal shipping casket from a black Cadillac hearse which apparently contained the body of the late President. The men put the shipping casket on the floor of the morgue and left and went back to their posts. The second casket entry was at 7:17 P.M., this casket was unloaded from a marked gray Navy ambulance by Secret Service Agent William Greer and Roy Kellerman, and two FBI agents Francis O’Neill and James Sibert. They took the Dallas casket into the morgue. O’Neill and Sibert’s testimony originally matched when they gave depositions to members of the House Select Committee in 1978. They were with Kellerman and Greer. O’Neill changed his testimony before the Records Review Board in 1997 and said he helped to take JFK’s body in with the honor guard to conform with the official entry of the Dallas casket being brought in with the honor guard at 8 P.M. Sibert never changed his testimony from what he told the HSCA in 1978 or the Records Review Board in 1997. So how can the FBI version be believed if one of the agents is willing to change what he actually saw or did? Where is the truth? Can it be found? I think now, that the ambulance chase, for lack of a better word, had more than a little to do with how there were different casket entries at different times into the Bethesda morgue. I can’t say I know how the conspirators managed it. We went around the grounds at least two, maybe three times. It was dark and cold and we couldn’t see much from the back of the pickup truck we were in I don’t know where the ambulance we were chasing went – the ambulance driver had to take a different route than we did – because we would have found the ambulance if we were just chasing each other around the grounds. But we didn’t. The gray Navy ambulance was just backing up to the morgue loading dock at the back of the morgue at the second or third lap around the complex. Were we distracted chasing the ambulance for 15 to 20 minutes to give the powers that be time to have Kellerman and Greer and O’Neill and Sibert – without the FBI agent’s knowledge – to bring in an empty casket from Dallas so that we could bring it in again at 8 P.M.?

I don’t know. After talking with the rest of the Honor Guard members who had not been able to be with the rest of us in Chicago, I went through a bit of depression. If we were used in some kind of deception to cover up what had happened to President Kennedy and from what I had learned at the meeting in Westmont, it seems more than likely. I don’t think Bud Barnum or Richard Gaudreau or Doug Mayfield believed there was a plot to kill Kennedy or that anything had really been going on during the so-called ambulance chase, or delivering the bronze display casket from Dallas to the Bethesda morgue at 8 o’clock – but those fellows hadn’t had the experience, Tim Cheek, James Felder and I had of listening to Dennis David and his story of giving orders to six or seven enlisted men to deliver a cheap metal shipping casket into the Bethesda morgue at 6:35 P.M. Nor did they hear from James Jenkins or Jim Metzler. These people had been in the morgue. I have listened carefully to all they said and I can say that their stories had the ring of truth. I had listened to Richard Lipsey’s story as well. We had been together on the helicopter shadowing the presidential motorcade that night in November, but I really didn’t have any connection to him at the conference. He had told the tale of seeing President Kennedy’s body on the autopsy table. Lipsey had said that the President’s left arm had been bent up at the elbow and he had been asked to hold JFK’s arm while an attendant got up onto the work table to straighten out the arm. I didn’t buy it. Why would they ask Lipsey who was just there to observe events to go up to the autopsy table and help the morgue attendant when there were already trained medical people who were dressed in the appropriate scrub clothing? And there is the matter that no one else that was at the Chicago meeting saw anything like that. As a trained investigator with the NYPD for more than two decades, I’ve learned that if you interview people at an event and only one person describes something that all the others who saw the same event did not see, there is a lack of credibility, so I didn’t buy everything I heard during the event in Westmont. After the event in Westmont, I continued my research into Kenne-dy’s assassination.

After the event in Westmont, I continued my research into Kenne-dy’s assassination. I read about Lee Harvey Oswald, his troubled Oswald died, and how his older brother Robert got away from home just as fast as he could, leaving Lee alone with their overbearing mother until, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the Marines. Oswald supposedly had dyslexia but wound up at Atsugi Air Force Base as a radar operator. There are many things I learned in research that surprised me. Oswald got a hardship discharge from the service, to help his ailing mother but then went to Russia. He was allowed to stay in Russia, got a job at a radio factory making more than the foreman of the facility, was allowed to marry a Russian woman whose uncle was a colonel in the Soviet military of internal affairs; The MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) was part of the Russian security police. After two years, Oswald was allowed back into the United States bringing his Russian wife with him and was questioned by no official except someone from the Travelers Aid Society, all at the height of the Cold War. Oswald landed in New Orleans with his Russian wife and child and, while he lived there, took a shot at General Edwin Walker, a right wing advocate. Oswald fired at Walker from a mere 20 feet away, but with the same rifle he shot at President Kennedy from over 200 feet and hit him? Never mind that Oswald hit the President more than once in six seconds. Nor do any of these aspects make sense: his supposed trip to Mexico City, or how Oswald just happened to get the job at the Texas school Book Depository, or how Oswald was shot after his capture at the Texas Theater, while in the custody of the Dallas police. I’m not an intellectual, but I am someone with a good amount of common sense and detective experience. In the end it wasn’t any of those things that made me believe Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone, if in fact if he acted at all. It was the Zapruder film. I had seen it before, of course, but after the Chicago adventure I was sent a copy of the 26 second home movie of the Kennedy assassination taken that day by Abraham Zapruder.

I had seen it before, of course, but after the Chicago adventure I was sent a copy of the 26 second home movie of the Kennedy assassination taken that day by Abraham Zapruder. I paid close attention to every frame, seeing it through fresh eyes and a different mindset. At the moment of the head shot, President Kennedy is shot in the front right side of his head. Even if Oswald shot Kennedy from behind, explain to me how the back of his head is blown out. I’m not a hunter, but I have been at the crime scene of many gunshot/ suicides. I know and any hunter will tell you, that a bullet goes into a body, leaving a small wound of entry, and comes out leaving a big hole. When the President was hit in the head, he fell over on his left side and into his wife’s lap. If the shot hit Kennedy from behind, it would have blown out part of his face. The photographs I was shown in Westmont, Illinois, showed no such damage. I’m no genius – but I am an ex-investigator with common sense and a good deal of training. My life since having been a participant at the meeting in the Windy City has been filled with a burning desire to know what happened to our President. To try and learn what part I had unwittingly played in the aftermath in the deception of JFK’s death to know how my honor guard comrades and I had been used. I still spent a fair amount of time on the golf course, but now my favorite pastime had to take a backseat to my obsession with the Kennedy assassination. Every time I read a new book on the assassination or see a new documentary about it, my indignation grows. Sometimes my wife would join me in watching something about the assassination and more than once I saw her with tears in her eyes. My time in the military took me all over the world. The one place I had never been was the site of John Kennedy’s murder, Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Now, at the age of 71, I thought I would never have the chance. I needed to see the area for myself. An investigator must always see the scene of the crime firsthand. I am a man of faith. My father after all, was a pastor. My prayer to go to Dealey Plaza was answered in the form of publisher Kris Millegan of TrineDay publishing.

As it turned out, William Law, one of the co-hosts of the Chicago gathering had a new edition of a book he had written to be published by Trine-Day publications and he called me and asked if I would read the book and consider writing the forward. “It’s never been done before,” William Law told me during a call. “Having a member of the Kennedy Honor Guard do the forward to the book might get people’s attention.” I read the book with the new material (Law had given me a copy of the old edition soon after I had arrived home to Atlanta) and I was pleased to see that included in the new addition was a piece written by Phil Singer, a kind of “teaser” for the documentary Phil and William were planning to produce of the film they had shot of the Westmont events. So I wrote the forward to the new addition to Law’s book with great enthusiasm. Soon after the book’s publication, I was asked to go to Dallas to give a guest presentation with William and a man now considered a friend, James Jenkins. That’s how I found myself in a room listening to a panel on the assassination say that the casket we had carried into the Bethesda Naval Hospital morgue had been loaded down with oxygen tanks. Now, sitting there, listening to a panel discussion about how the casket team took a casket to the morgue and then it was filled with oxygen tanks, I couldn’t stay quiet. I found myself getting up from my chair and walking towards the panel. The room was filled with people. I walked up to Kris Millegan, “Kris,” I said. “You have to let me speak to this.” When I was in the military I was assigned to the United States Navy Honor Guard, and part of my job was the responsibility of training and carrying out military funerals. My last funeral in Washington DC was John F. Kennedy. Now I have documentation, I have pictures of the casket, along with six or five other military men. We could determine how much a casket weighed, because we buried over 250 people at Arlington. Now when I hear you say that the casket weighed 2500 pounds – that’s not accurate. There were only six of us at Andrews Air Force base that took the bronze casket off the elevator truck and put it in a Navy ambulance. At no time, if there were oxygen bottles, they would have been clanging together.

At no time, if there were oxygen bottles, they would have been clanging together. At one point during our evacuation of the remains from the elevator truck, we almost dropped the casket. Now there were only six of us at the time. When we put the bronze casket into the ambulance, we shadowed it all the way to Bethesda Naval Hospital. At no time did that motorcade stop, because we were going at a high rate of speed, we were in a helicopter and we shadowed it. Now there at a point in time at Bethesda we left the ambulance for approximately 15 minutes. And again, the six of us were able to carry that casket. And at no time was there any clanging, and believe me there would have been clanging. As you can see that entire book is a copy of every aspect of President John F. Kennedy’s funeral, so believe me when I tell you, believe me when I tell you, that at no time was the Bronze casket out of our sight. At no time, excuse me if I get a little emotional, I told you about betrayal. The entire time we were at Bethesda Naval Hospital, the only casket that was brought into the morgue while we were present, was the bronze casket. At no time did we handle a silver shipping casket. The only other casket that went into the morgue that night was a mahogany casket that weighed approximately 1300 pounds. The only casket that came out of the morgue that night was a mahogany casket that weighed 1300 pounds. After 51% years, this gentleman right here, Phil Singer, brought the casket team and the gentlemen that worked in the morgue together. And as I told you, we had no idea who was on the inside of the morgue and who was on the outside of the morgue. But when we came together, which the government didn’t expect, because when we left Washington , I went overseas to embassy duty, the other guys went to Asia, somebody else went to Africa, so we never had an opportunity to sit down together as a group and talk about the experience. But when we came together, in February of this year, he’d never told us that we were going to tell a story, he just said, “I wanted to have a reunion with you guys.” Now nobody had spoken to each other in 51 years, but now we told our story, about Andrews Air Force Base, Bethesda", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:62:40dadee1320b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4673, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "Asia, somebody else went to Africa, so we never had an opportunity to sit down together as a group and talk about the experience.

And then it was time for the corpsmen in the morgue to tell their story, and they started out by saying, “We don’t mean to dispute what you’re saying, but a half an hour before you got here, we took a silver shipping casket out of a black hearse, and we brought it into the morgue, and we set it on the floor, and we moved the President’s body that was wrapped in sheets and we placed it on the table.” Now you can imagine, the almost fight that we had, in terms of who was lying to whom, but they politely said, “We’re not disputing what you did, we are merely telling you what we did.” Now these are corpsmen, these are enlisted men – they have no reason to lie. But it was at that time, where we all began to look at each other and say, “What was the purpose, the man was dead.” And you heard Jim Jenkins talk about not finding any fragmentation, not finding any trace evidence, well that’s what a cop like me would look for. So it simply meant to us, that the body had already been sanitized. That it made a stop before it got to Bethesda Naval Hospital. And what you didn’t know, what you didn’t know, that we found out, that I found out, at the time the autopsy was taking place, we had an opportunity to look in, to go in, and view this, and I refused to go in, but I did take a peek. And one of the things that I could see from the waist up was that there was a chock block under the President’s neck. And I never forgot it, because for me it looked like the president was sleeping. Well when I got out of the military in 1966, I became a New York City detective, and one time to the visit to the morgue, I walked in and I started smiling, and my partner said, “What are you smiling for in the morgue?” And I said, “That’s what I saw under the President’s neck.” And it wasn’t until I came to Chicago, and quote unquote saw the official pictures of the president’s autopsy, I said, “That’s not what I saw,” and if you remember what Jim Jenkins said, because he was in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:63:0a399d09be2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4674, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "York City detective, and one time to the visit to the morgue, I walked in and I started smiling, and my partner said, “What are you smiling for in the morgue?” And I said, “That’s what I saw under the President’s neck.” And it wasn’t until I came to Chicago, and quote unquote saw the official pictures of the president’s autopsy, I said, “That’s not what I saw,” and if you remember what Jim Jenkins said, because he was in the morgue that night. He said, “We don’t’ even have that (chock block) at Bethesda Naval Hospital.” Thank you. I don’t know what I was expecting after I walked the two blocks from my hotel to the Plaza. In the Zapruder film of the assassination, the Plaza looked enormous, at least a couple of football fields long and wide. But seeing it from where I was standing – at the corner of the plaza where the President’s limousine pops into view in the Zapruder film, straight ahead was a shockingly small area. I continued to walk in the Plaza. I noticed there was a slight decline of the road something I couldn’t tell from the Zapruder film. I stopped for a moment unsure what to look at first. I walked up the incline of the grassy Knoll; there was a long plaque and I read what was inscribed there: We in this country, in this generation, are – by destiny rather than choice – the watchman on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility – that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint – and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of ‘peace on earth, good will toward men.’ That must always be our goal – and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago…”except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. I walked over to the spot where Abraham Zapruder had stood on the small four foot pedestal when he took the now famous film. I took my hand and swept it over the surface. It looked like it had a fresh coat of paint applied in the not too distant past. I walked a few feet up the Knoll to my right and found myself inside the cement structure that I later learned was called the pergola. I walked down its length from the inside and I encountered Robert Groden whom I had met in Chicago. We greeted each other. I then stepped off the cement and onto the grass and walked behind the picket fence. I stood at the corner and then walked down seven or eight feet to where a gunman may have stood and fired the shot that had hit President Kennedy", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:64:f095f96d2763", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4675, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "inside the cement structure that I later learned was called the pergola.

I stood at the corner and then walked down seven or eight feet to where a gunman may have stood and fired the shot that had hit President Kennedy in the right side of his head. I stood there taking it all in. I turned my head left and looked at school book depository. I shifted my eyes to the spot in the street where Kennedy had been shot, the last fatal shot that blasted out the back of his head. I had, by now, read James Humes cryptic statement before the Warren commission. Allen Dulles had asked Humes if Kennedy’s head wound was consistent from a shot from behind JFK. Humes had replied, “Scientifically sir, it is impossible for it to have been fired from other than behind, or to have exited other than from behind.” As I stood there behind the picket fence looking at the street, I knew it was all bullshit. A shot from where I was standing was perfect for what was on the Zapruder film. JFK was hit in the head, and his head went back to the left and Kennedy fell into his wife’s lap. I shook my head in disbelief. I thought, “No wonder people have been so stirred up about this for fifty years. No one could stand here behind this fence and think anything else but that he was shot from here.” I turned around and looked behind me at the parking lot. I remembered the story of Lee Bowers, who said he had been in the tower before the assassination. I had recently seen Mark Lane’s 1966 film, Rush to Judgment, and I heard Lee Bowers’ voice in my head as I looked at the tower, “At the time of the shooting… There was a flash of light or it was something which occurred which caught my eye on the immediate area on the embankment. Now what this was I could not say at that time and at this time I could not identify it other than there was some unusual occurrence, a flash of light or smoke which caused me to feel like something had occurred there.” Bowers was then asked by Lane to give the spacing of the shots he heard which in Bowers opinion were three. “There were three shots and they were spaced with one shot, a pause and then two shots in very close order, such as,” perhaps Bowers took his right hand and knocked on the table he and Lane were sitting at: “knock – knock knock, “almost on top of each", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:65:f6ecbf99b9e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4676, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 66, "text": "which caused me to feel like something had occurred there.” Bowers was then asked by Lane to give the spacing of the shots he heard which in Bowers opinion were three. “There were three shots and they were spaced with one shot, a pause and then two shots in very close order, such as,” perhaps Bowers took his right hand and knocked on the table he and Lane were sitting at: “knock – knock knock, “almost on top of each other while there was some pause between the first and second shots.… When I stated I felt like the second and third shots could not have been fired from the same rifle, the [FBI] reminded me I was not an expert.” I had to agree. “Yeah, I’ll bet,” I said aloud. I turned back around for one more look at the view of the street. I walked back from behind the picket fence and found myself at the top of some cement steps that led down from the Knoll to the street. It had a handrail all the way from the top of the steps to the bottom. I didn’t recognize it from watching the Zapruder film, so I could only surmise it was fairly new. The metal rail was hot to the touch as I put my hand out to steady myself as I walked carefully down the steps. As I made the slow walk down the steps, I couldn’t help thinking of that other slow walk, step by step, so very long ago up the steps of the capital and down slowly step-by-step and then the long walk where the world watched as we took John Fitzgerald Kennedy to his final resting place. On the sidewalk, I was surprised to see a small metal plaque embedded at the edge of the grass at the curb. It described Dealey Plaza as an historical landmark. The date on the plaque was 1993. I looked up from the plaque to see a large white X in the street. I realized the X marked where John Kennedy had been hit by that last fatal shot to his head. I stood there mesmerized, looking at the X in the street. Traffic was almost nonexistent. I stepped off the curb and walked a few steps and stood directly on the white marker. I was facing the triple overpass. I now knew there had been several people on the overpass during the assassination, including men who work at the railroad, Elmer Todd and his supervisor S.M. Holland. These men both saw smoke floating above the trees from the picket fence where they were standing on the overpass.

I’m an eye to eye guy. Every investigator on a case needs to be able to see the person’s face and observe his expressions as he tells his story. You have to be able to see how he holds his body. I wasn’t able to do all of this, of course, but Lane’s film took me closer than I would have been able to get otherwise. Now that having been said, no one should have been able to be on the overpass except law enforcement. It had been sloppy, sloppy police and Secret Service work. I turned around, still standing directly on the X in the street. I now faced in the direction of the book depository. I raised my right arm checking the trajectory and angle from where I was standing. I turned and now faced the grassy knoll and did the same. For 50 years I believed Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy. But now, standing right on the spot where he had been shot, I couldn’t buy it. The first lesson a policeman learns is to protect the crime scene. Double the perimeter of the scene to make sure everything is protected, everything. Speak to every witness separately, so their stories are untainted with another witness’s visual and verbal memories. The crime scene in Dealey Plaza was not protected. Why were people who were not certified law-enforcement allowed on the overpass? Why were people allowed to trample the area behind the picket fence tainting any evidence that may have been found? Why were no law-enforcement officials standing behind the fence on the Knoll in the first place to make sure no one could take a shot at President Kennedy from that spot? It was a perfect place to shoot from. How could JFK have been allowed to be brought in to an area like this? I felt anger boiling inside. It was all here; the witnesses, the puff of smoke or flash of light at the time of the assassination; men on the overpass who had seen smoke on the Knoll behind the fence; the head snapped back and to the left. Oswald supposedly took a shot at right wing General Edwin Walker at his home. Oswald who was hiding, watched Walker read a newspaper 20 feet away and fired at him and missed.

I had spent my time since coming back from Westmont, Illinois, in February 2015, immersing myself in books on the assassination, looking at documents on the assassination. I had even gone back to Chicago under the auspices of Phil Singer in September of the same year, where I met Abraham Bolden who was the first black Secret Service agent handpicked by the President himself. I met him at his home and found him to be a nice sincere man who told me of his time in the agency where he was treated terribly by his fellow agents. Racism was rampant at that time in the Secret Service. Not all were guilty of racism, I’m sure, but enough. I also met with Antoinette Giancana, daughter of the Chicago mob boss, Sam “Momo” Giancana. When I met Antoinette, she asked me right off the bat, who I thought killed her father. I was by now, familiar with the story of Sam Giancana, who was killed in the basement of his own home while cooking sausage and peppers. He was to testify before the HSCA in the next few days. But someone made sure he would never testify by putting a .22 bullet behind his ear and several around his mouth, an old Sicilian warning to keep your mouth shut. I looked at her and said, “I think he was killed by the CIA.” Antoinette, who was about 80 years old at the time, looked at me with a twinkle in her eye and said, “Fucking right!” The mechanism put in place to protect the most important man in the world broke down. How does something like this happen? The Dallas police force was supposedly the best in the country. Watching the Orville Nix film, I noticed that the motorcade officers – who were riding at the side of the President’s limousine, towards the back, after the President had been shot, dropped back to where they were not even really near the car.

What was that all about? As I have previously stated, the most important thing I learned as an investigator is to protect the perimeter, in essence to protect the evidence. This was not done in the most important murder case in history. The building where Oswald supposedly shot Kennedy was not entirely closed off. Cartridges that were found near the 6^(th) floor window, Captain Fritz picked up before they could be tested for fingerprints – it was said for years that Captain Fritz took no notes of the Oswald interrogation, only to have a bunch of notes suddenly be found and given to the Records Review Board. I recalled reading that when Fritz was questioned by the Warren commission, he said he took no notes at the time of all the Oswald interrogation, but made some notes days later. Protection of the crime scene, the evidence i.e. chain of custody of the evidence, was not protected. I don’t care if it was a bunch of “good old boys” from Dallas,Texas, procedure is procedure, and they should have known exactly what to do. And they blew it, as did the agents of the Secret Service. Senator Ralph Yarborough in his Warren Commission affidavit said, “After the shooting … all of the Secret Service men seemed to me to respond very slowly, with no more than a puzzled look … I am amazed at the lack of instantaneous response from the Secret Service.” I was angered to learn the Secret Service destroyed their trip reports, for September through November 1963, when the Records Review Board asked for them. I stood on the big white X in the street, feeling the warmth of the Texas sunshine, something President John Kennedy never got another chance to do. My emotions were like a roller coaster inside of me. I looked at the grassy knoll and then back to the school book depository. How did they let this happen? Why did this happen? There was only one answer: betrayal, the betrayal of the President. The betrayal of every God-fearing man, woman and child in 1963, who believed in a thing called democracy. The betrayal continues to this day. By the acquiescence of the media and the propagandist who continue to spew out the pablum of “one man from a building, killed another man in a car.” John F.

A man, who was not virtuous, but could lead others toward virtue. This country allowed me, a black kid from the streets of New York to grow up to live a good life, to have certain values and ideals, and when fate found me at a place in history when I was called to do my duty, I did my very best, along with my comrades, to take my commander-in-chief to his place of rest. I’m going to continue to search for the truth of the assassination. I owe John Kennedy that. And so does his country.

And then with two bars, in the Navy, it would be a Lieutenant, but in the Army in the Marine Corps he would be a Captain, all right?

Other than leaving the remains that the gravesite, what we would call ‘the chapel service’ where we would leave the remains there in the chapel inside all at the cemetery. And the chapel service, we would have to meet the hearse at the chapel, take it out of the hearse, bring it into the chapel, after the service we would go down and we would retrieve the remains, bring it back out, put him in- back into the hearse, and then follow it to the gravesite where we did there before, like, a block before we reached the gravesite, the pallbearers would speed ahead, jump out, and be there to greet the hearse when it arrived.

Once the family gets settled, then the services start where the pastor or the Chaplin would do the funeral and then he would look at me or look at the usher – whoever was in charge of the detail – he would look at the usher, the usher would look at the casket-team and nod his head, and then we would start polling the flag. Law: Okay, so- so just for my own edification – I might use this – take me from the lowest kind of funeral- I want- I want to know that from the lowest ranking person, describe their funeral to me, and then maybe a middle person, and then the highest ranking. Explain that. Explain the procedures to me. Clark: It is an acknowledgment of a fallen warrior and it’s like his final salute. After we would get the remains at the graveside, the flag would be over the casket, the funeral would go on and there are certain things that we would do just to reach the end because the flag had to be a b o v e the remains so you wouldn’t want to have it sagging or touching the casket, because once you take it off, it would be a sign of disrespect to have it sloping down on the casket. So what would happen is we would give each other different signals when we wanted to switch. We would, tag on the flag, so we knew that okay, it’s time to change hands. Sometimes your hand would start to cramp up from holding it so tight, so we would hit the hands, and then we would be able to relax a little bit – one side would relax while the other side held it. Clark: After the chaplain or the pastor would finish the funeral, the funeral director would look at the usher and nod his head and the usher would walk over to the family and say “At this time, the firing party Will fire three volleys which Will be followed by taps.” The usher would then turn and salute the firing party, or the person that is in charge", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt:71:4927b0c65618", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4682, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-JFK-Honor-Guard-Speaks/dp/1634240936", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Betrayal_0005IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "little bit – one side would relax while the other side held it.

And then the person in charge of the firing party would say “Fire party, Attention.” They would turn to attention.

And then we would start folding the flag. And then the taps would be blown. Clark: What would happen is we would step forward and those on the head would turn, the left side, would fold the flag. Everybody has their hands on the flag. Nobody lets go. We would step forward and the guys on the right would take almost like a fold, we would fold it and then we would fold it again, then the guys at the foot would take the measurement about a foot and a half and then they would turn the flag up where we start the fold. Each individual, each pall bearer would take a fold and once he takes his hold he slaps down back down to its entry. It goes all the way up to the head, that means the stars, where the stars are. They then take the measurements once the fold comes all the way up, He takes the fold, he measures, he turns the upper portion in, and then we fold it where there is no red showing and when there would be no red showing the pall bearer would tuck it in. He then turns to the funeral director, and really snaps it out to the funeral director. Once the funeral director takes it, he holds it in front of the pall bearer, the pall bearer salutes it and turns back into the casket.

Clark: I remember we were sitting on a bus and I think it was Section 18 or Section 21 and we were sitting on the bus waiting for the hearse to show up. And as soon as we spot the hearse, we jump out, we form up, the firing party goes twenty yards away from the graveside and when it forms up, I was sitting on the bus and I was saying to myself, “I know I’d do this, I know I’d do this,” and it wasn’t like I was at the head and the foot, I was more or less in the middle, where most of the new guys started out because the head and foot were more responsibility. But because you are new, they put you in the middle, so whatever mistakes you made it could be covered up. But I just felt that I was ready. And I remember I was the only one looking out of the window and everybody else would be like not when they get, they said when we do see and I am looking out the window because I was nervous and I was the first one to spot it “there it comes.” I was the first one off the bus and everybody else was taking their time because they knew their prize but I was excited because it was my first funeral. I was so cognoscente that the entire time the remains were pulling up, I was going through my head – okay you do this, you follow, if they say three paces, you take the three paces with no turning, and if they say four paces forward, then you take the four paces forward and then you turn in. But three paces simply means that you walk up three paces and stop. Three paces forward means you take three paces forward and turn in. Clark: Right. So what happens is if the hearse pulls up, you’re not right on top of it, you’re about maybe four or five feet up from the hearse. You don’t want the hearse to go by and it hits you so you’re like back away. When the hearse pulls up and then the person in charge of the group Will say, “Body bearers, three paces forward.” So we take three paces forward and then we go to Parade REST.

Now we’re facing the back of the hearse and then he’d say, “Body bearers, two paces.” And two paces would bring us right up to the door of the hearse and the person in charge would open the hearse – open the door and then we would start to pull the remains out. And everything is done at attention. You don’t – nobody’s leaning over, everything is done at attention because you want to maintain military precision. That’s the whole purpose of a military funeral, to let this be like the last respect for this guy. Nothing is done haphazardly. So when it comes out, we make sure that the flag is on right, we make sure that the foot always goes toward the gravesite first. The foot of the casket. The head is always where the blue is, that’s the head of the casket. So when you’re marching toward the graveside, you’re taking like side-steps to get away from the hearse and then the person in charge of the funeral or of the pall bearers, he Will nod his head and then we’ll start walking towards the gravesite. Once we get to the gravesite – the family is following – once we get to the gravesite, everybody’s standing up and this is why – I don’t know whether I said it but when you’re – back at our barracks, we always had a weight rule because those caskets can be heavy and we would always in – how do you say it? We were always – when you want somebody to do something, you – Oh, we were always encouraged to lift weights. We’d do curls and stuff like that and lift weights because you never knew when you were going to get it heavy. And you had to be in shape because a lot of the times, when you got to the gravesite, you couldn’t just drop the casket down, you had to slowly lower the casket. And if you had it heavy and you’re doing it slow, you can hurt your back if you’re not in shape.

I didn’t know any of those guys. We’ve probably seen each other in Arlington because we would be crisscrossing. If I’ll go from section to section, the Marines would be in one section, we’d be in another section, they already would be in another section. You’d be amazed at how many funerals would be going on and on in Arlington National Cemetery. Clark: Well, you got to understand that a lot of these guys were not young guys. These were not young men that were killed in battle. Every now and then, we would get a young guy. Sometimes, it would be a military child that has to be buried with their father or whoever at Arlington so you would have that. And that would make you feel you’d get sensitive today. But back in 1962, I can remember burying guys coming from Vietnam and we have never even heard of that place. But it’s early as then, people would [sic] being buried in Arlington that were killed in Vietnam. And we have never heard of it. When you’re that young people, we would see on the paper that they would give us: what section and who was being laid to rest. And you could see, 1944 or 1934 or from WWII or stuff like that. So a lot of them were older veterans that had passed away. Clark: No. I mean not becoming insensitive but It’s like “I’m doing my job and I’m going to do it the best.” But every funeral were invited is like a major thing for us. It was like the last send off for this person and we wanted to do the best job that we could to make the family feel that “Hey, these guys make me appreciate my spouse or my dad’s military service.” Clark: 1963.

There are times that wind will be whipping and that flag and I mean we would really have to hold onto that flag because that flag would try and flap and if it gets away that is disrespectful. For us it is disrespectful. And then you are wearing white gloves and your hands are freezing but you endure. You just do what you need to do. LIPSEY: That is correct. Now let me ask you fellows a question. Before we start and the only thing that I question about this conversation is that – and I don’t even remember, I don’t have a copy of it. Now, you know everything from getting the Honor Guard there and everything. And I did watch the autopsy, not all 100% of it but the majority of it. About a week or so later I remember signing a document that we that fell under some Federal Secrets Act, should not discuss any thing we felt was a secret nature particularly about the autopsy for 15 years. Now are you excluded from this? LIPSEY: Born on Oct 7, 1939 in Selma, Alabama, and I reside right here in Baton Rouge. I was at the time, I’d been in the service I was stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana. While I was there several hundred Lt.’s got interviewed for the job, well didn’t get interviewed, there were several hundred there, I was one of several that was fortunate enough to get interviewed for the job of aide de camp to Gen Wehle who was at Ft. Polk. I was selected as his Jr. aide at that time, I was a 2nd Lt.. Shortly thereafter, in June, Gen Wehle was notified that he was being transferred to Washington as commander general of MBW. [Somewhat condensed for clarity] And his senior aide, as most Generals do, take care of their aides, arranged for senior aide to attend command and general staff college in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. And he asked me if I’d like to accompany him to Washington, which I did. I was very grateful to get out of Ft. Polk. When I got to Washington Gen. Wehle was due two aides, a senior, in his position, his aide could have been a Colonel or up to Captain. Gen Wehle and I got along very well.

I had so much respect for him, he was just a super human being. We worked so well together that he just didn’t get another aide, I was it. I took the place of both aides. So I was Gen Wehle’s aide while he was the Commanding Secretary General in Washington. And also at some special events I served as a social aide at the White House, military aide at night at some occasions. But the majority of my time was spent working day and night for Gen Wehle. Coast Guard, Marines – worked together on projects, receptions, when dignitaries came to the US on special events, on funerals, on parades, whatever, our service was the senior service and Gen Wehle was always in command. That’s how we happened to handle the funeral obviously when Kennedy got killed. All ceremonial aspects of military, anything the military has to do with Washington in regard to ceremony, all the services participate, is run by the Army and since Gen Wehle was the commanding officer and I was his aide, I was the detail man. Did a lot of his planning and helped him a lot. The funeral was our project from the time I was in Washington and he was killed. I happened to be driving up to the Gen’s house at 1:00 to pick him up to go back to the office and had the radio on. And heard the news flash the same as everybody else did. The Gen had his radio on in the house and we met at the door. I was coming in as he was coming out. We immediately went back to our office and got on the phone with the White House. Got on the phone with the Pentagon, got on the phone with everybody else and immediately put what needed to be done into progress. We met the body at Andrews Airforce Base. We had everything organized by that afternoon. We had Marines organized with their little Honor Guard. We had the men from Ft. Meyer, the third old [?] guard, the guys like at Humphry’s funeral, the ceremonial guard that watched the casket. The ceremonial troop in Washington had been arranged to meet the body at Andrews. Put it in a hearse. We had a decoy hearse because we knew there was a mob waiting at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

So we got in a couple of these helicopters with our honor guard when they left and flew over to the hospital to get there before they did. And when they came in, one of the hearses went right up to the front door. All of the crowd, of course, rushed over there. The one with the body in it went around to the back where the morgue was and we unloaded it. We met them in the back and unloaded it right there to avoid the news media and the crowd and everything else. LIPSEY: The body was brought in the back door, backed right up to the loading ramp right immediately next to the morgue. And we unloaded it there and then Jackie Kennedy and her family and everybody that was, you know, flown to Washington and come back with the body, they came in the hospital the front way and went upstairs to the Presidential Suite at the hospital. Gen. Wehle went up to the suite to start to talk to Mrs. Kennedy to make the funeral arrangements with her, tentative arrangements mind you, because this was still early. Seeing what they wanted done and getting more wheels into motion because we didn’t know exactly to do. And Gen Wehle told me, “Don’t leave this body!” “You don’t leave it,” and I didn’t except when he came back down and went in and spelled me for a little while. LIPSEY: Remember this is 14 years ago. I mean it’s so little span of time and I’ve thought about it so often recounted it to friends all except for what I actually saw at the autopsy. We took the body to the morgue. The only other person that I can remember besides the doctors, and there were the team of doctors that worked on the body, the only other person that I can remember, beside the doctors was inside of the room was a 1st Lt. Sam Bird. I was a 1st Lt. Sam was head of the Old Guard, I really can’t think of what they called them, the guys, two or three teams of fellows that were always responsible of the casket in a ceremony – when a general died. Three of them march on each side of the casket, enlisted men and there is an officer in charge. At all the important funerals held while I was there, Sam was always the officer in charge.

He was the guy that had been standing there all night long ready to pick up the casket or do whatever’s necessary and move it around. He was in charge of the detail that guarded the casket, a formality-type thing. He was there, in and out of the room during the autopsy. So, anyhow. They brought the body in, took it out. Laid it on the table. It was the first dead man I’d ever seen, and I’d never seen an autopsy, obviously, I’d never seen an autopsy before. So it was a pretty traumatic experience. I wouldn’t really, quite frankly, I couldn’t tell the General, “No, I not going in the room.” So I went. I’d never realized seeing a dead man with rigor mortis – it just didn’t seem like you were looking at a dead person, it was just entirely a different thing. It didn’t bother me at all. I remember that Sam went out during the ceremony and sent one of his men to get us some hamburgers, it was late at night since we hadn’t eaten since that morning. We sat in there watching part of the autopsy eating hamburgers. So obviously there was the smell of formaldehyde in there. That’s what bothered me. The smell was worse than the sight. So, we watched the autopsy. Once again, my hours are a little fuzzy. The autopsy lasted approx. , if I’m not mistaken, approx. 3 – 4 hours. After that we stayed in the room. When the men from the funeral home came in, because, by this time when Gen Wehle had come back down, but he was in and out. He was still making a lot of arrangements, but he would come in occasionally for a couple of minutes to let me go out and take a little break. Then the men from the funeral home came in and we sat there while they more or less put him back together and made the cosmetic, made the different cosmetic changes that had to be made on the body. LIPSEY: I honestly couldn’t tell you. I have no earthly idea. All I know is the got the clothes from the White House and I helped the funeral home.

I helped them pick him up and laid him in the casket. And as far as I know I was the last to look at him – standing there when they closed it. Then the story just goes on and on about the funeral. I don’t know how really relevant that part can be. Just formal planning and carrying out the funeral. LIPSEY: Yeah, well as far as the exact x-rays were taken, no I don’t recall. I do recall the comments from the doctors, you know, who started examining the body before they did anything, you know, looking at the body, looking at where the bullets had entered the back of the his head. It was obvious that one bullet entered the back of his head and exited on the right side of his face and pretty well blew away the right side of his head. And then the other two bullets had entered the lower part of his neck and the best of my knowledge, or the best of my memory, one had exited. The other bullet had entered from behind and hit his chest cavity and the bullet went down into the body. And during the autopsy, this is the only part that I can imagine would be of any – really, what I’ve told you right there, of strictly confidential nature that was never written up anywhere. And I presume, am I right, that this tape and this conversation is strictly confidential? You know, it’s not going to be published I guess is what I’m getting at? LIPSEY: Okay, Well, is that as far as I can remember, and I’m pretty positive about it, they never found that third bullet. It did not exit the body. When they did the autopsy first they cut the top of his head off and then they cut his chest open, you know, and they got all of his insides out, that was the only gory part, they took them out a piece at a time and laid them up on, I remember, a beautiful clean stainless steel rack with water pouring over it all the time. I imagine to keep it fresh or whatever. They did the whole autopsy then they came back and, you know, sliced up all the organs. LIPSEY: I don’t know what they were using them for.

They were taking pictures of them, they, you know, and they were examining them. I don’t know whether they were taking them for records or not. I don’t think the doctors, to be perfectly frank, I don’t think it ever entered the doctors’ minds that they were taking pictures for a formal investigation. They were doing an autopsy, a complete autopsy, and whatever physical records that you maintain during an autopsy was what they were doing. I know they did a very thorough job because every time one to them would say something the other one would question it. I can remember they looked at this one organ and they passed it around and all three discussed it before they would go on to the most part. You know, it wasn’t one guy doing his operating on the feet, one on the chest, and one on the head. They did everything together and re-examined everything together. I remember that distinctly. They looked like one of the most efficient teams doing anything that I’ve ever seen. But anyhow, like I say. I can remember lifting his chest cavity and then the top of his head off, and you know, all the internal organs out. And I can remember them discussing the third, third bullet. First, second and third bullet. The third bullet, the one they hadn’t found. Their only logical explanation was that it hit him in the back of the head, hit his chest cavity and then, like bullets will do – I am sure you are familiar with that one, you could shoot somebody, no telling where the bullet is going to and up – probably hit his chest cavity and could have gone all the way down into his toe. You know, it could have just hit and gone right down into his leg or wherever. But I don’t think, to the best of my knowledge, they ever found the third bullet. LIPSEY: This is what I’m getting back to. I don’t know that they found bullets or whether they found just particles of bullets. I don’t think they know. I don’t think they found any whole bullets. But that is just strictly speculation on my part. I remember they were bound and determined to find that bullet because it didn’t have an exit mark. But I don’t think they ever found the bullet.

The one that hit his chest, the one that exited here – [corrects himself] entered here; there was no exit hole. So the bullet was somewhere in his body, obviously. LIPSEY: From the angle they were talking about it had to come from quite a height because they were looking and talking to each other the angle they were pointing that had hit him had to be a down angle. Also all of them, their entire discussion – I never entered the discussion and neither did Sam Bird. We were sitting there watching and listening. And we weren’t asked our opinion, for obvious reasons. We wouldn’t have known what we were talking about. We never entered in any conversation with the docs or offered any information except when we were talking. And I didn’t personally think, personal opinion, from listening to the doctors, watching the autopsy, there was no question in their minds that the bullets came from the same direction that all three bullets came from the same place at the same time. They weren’t different angles. They all had the same pattern to them. LIPSEY: Alright, as I remember them there was one bullet that went in the back of the head that exited and blew away part of his face. And that was sort of high up, not high up but like this little crown on the back of your head right there, three or four inches above your neck. And then the other one entered at more of less the top of the neck, the other one entered more of less at the bottom of the neck. LIPSEY: The bullet entered lower part of the head or upper part of the neck. [long pause] To the best of my knowledge, came out the front of the neck. But the one that I remember they spent so much time on, obviously, was the one they found did not come out. There was a bullet – that’s my vivid recollection cause that’s all they talked about. For about two hours all they talked about was finding that bullet. To the rest of my recollection they found some particles but they never found the bullet – pieces of it, trances of it. The best of my knowledge, this is one thing I definitely remember they just never found that whole bullet. LIPSEY: Because of the angle.

I remember that’s how they kept talking bout the angles of the bullets because the angles that they entered the body. That’s why, they, I remember, measuring and doing all kinds of things. They turned the body up at one point to determine where that bullet that entered back here that didn’t have an exit mark. Where was that bullet? And so when it got to down to where they thought it hit his chest cavity, they opened him up and started looking in here. That’s why I remember one thing, they took, after they had taken all his organs out, during the autopsy they had them sitting up there: “Now let’s see if we can find the bullet.” They cut all his organs apart. I don’t know what they did with them, I don’t remember but they put them in some kind of containers. I don’t remember but they put them in containers. LIPSEY: I wasn’t concerned about them. Never entered my mind to even ask. I might point out at this time that Sam Bird, the other Lt. that I’m talking about. And I could kick myself 3 times for not doing it. We had a lot of documented records that had to do with the funeral itself. You know, planning it and the Old Guard, the presidents, and the kings and queens who all were there. Every step of the record. I’ve got a lot of those records at home, newspapers with my picture on the cover during the funeral and all that. But I do remember, right after, this was all started Friday night and we buried him on Monday afternoon. I remember Tuesday night or Wednesday night, one night that week, sitting in Sam’s apartment. He made a recording on the everything he had seen and done from the time Kennedy was assassinated until the time they buried him, for his own personal record. And I could kick my self for not doing the same thing. But I remember him doing that. LIPSEY: Tuesday, Wednesday night after the autopsy. The autopsy was Friday night. I remember we left after the autopsy. I was sitting there with Sam. the funeral people put Kennedy back together. That took almost as long as the autopsy.

We finally finished and we put the body back into the hearse. And Jackie Kennedy came down and got into the hearse with the body herself. Still had on the pink suit – she hadn’t changed clothes. We led it. Gen Wehle and myself were the first car. If I’m not mistaken, there was a police car in front of us. The hearse right behind us. Then a family car behind that. One or two other cars in the procession. We went back to the White House. We drove up, went into the White House, parked. We’d had all this arranged so it had to be very formalized now. Mrs. K and the hearse with the body stopped at the entrance. We called, I’ll never forget this, we called the Marine barracks which was across the river in Virginia twenty minutes before we left the hospital. It might have been 15 minutes, we called them and told them we wanted an honor guard to lead the body into the White House and to make a cordon as the Old Guard moved and carried it out of the White House. [seems very moved, voice tight with grief] They woke those boys out of a dead sleep and they were at the White House before we were. They had a group of them marching in front of the hearse. Went very slow. We took the body out, took it in the white house. Into the East Room if I remember correctly. At that time they had a priest there. It was Bobby, Jackie, White House servants, one or two other people and Gen Wehle and myself. They had a little private service, a little Funeral service lasting 10-15 minutes. That picture ended up a double page spread. They ended up they had a photographer in there. No other news service allowed there. It must have been an official photograph. That ended up as a double page spread picture in a magazine. That doesn’t have anything to do with what you’re trying to find out. LIPSEY: No I don’t’ I remember him making the tape.

To that point, if he did put it on tape, about the autopsy and basically we saw the exact same thing, that tape would be a lot more valuable to you than what I am telling you today. It would be a lot more valuable. LIPSEY: Yeah. He was still stationed there when I left. I imagine he stayed there for his tour of duty. Matter of fact, Gen Wehle asked Sam – Sam and I got to be very good friends. We lived right across from each other at Ft. Meters in the Officer’s HQ. Sam had he had been a general’s aide at his previous station. When I left Washington Gen W got me to ask Sam if he would replace me as Gen Wehle’s aide. Sam felt he’d been a general’s aide once and he felt he needed a tour of duty on his records instead of another general aide position just so he could seek rank faster. I don’t know if he stayed in the Army or got out of the Army. He was a permanent type. To the best of my knowledge Sam Bird’s probably still in the Army, if he’s alive. And I certainly hope he is. He was a fine person. LIPSEY: I’m sure they must have. No. I’m not sure they must have. They must have discussed it among themselves. Whether they discussed with anybody else or the chief of surgery of the hospital. I’m sure they probably did. I don’t know. I honestly don’t know. I can’t make any comment on that because I don’t know. LIPSEY: Yeah, I was, but truthfully, I paid attention to what I wanted to pay attention to. It was one of those deals where I was curious how many times he’d been shot, or where he’d been shot. Medical definitions of what type of wounds they were, and whatever, I tuned all that out probably. I didn’t know what they were talking about and I just didn’t care.

LIPSEY: When you walked in the autopsy room from the back door where they brought the body in, you turned left down a very little short hallway. Had the doors right there. When you walked in there was sort of a like a little spectator’s gallery, on the right there were several chairs on the right with a railing in front. The table was in front of that. I would say I was about as far as from that jacket, maybe, from the doctors, approximately about 12-15 feet. LIPSEY: The first thing they did was look over the body. I can remember that, you know, from head to toe, all sides. They just looked at the whole thing. And made, they discussed a lot of things. That’s probably the part I tuned out. I do remember looking it over thoroughly. I do remember the body still was covered with blood. I remember them cleaning it off, taking, I remember a brush, a scrub brush, cleaning the body in certain areas before they started cutting. I remember after they finished, scrubbing it down again, you know, getting all the mess away and everything. They scrubbed and cleaned it pretty good after all the preliminary looking they wanted to, before they physically touched the body, they had to clean the body before they started. LIPSEY: Both. Because, I could see the body, I could see the rear. I could see obviously the side of the face. Although that’s just when I walked in they took him out the casket – I saw that. Beside the side wound, because when I went back and sat down, they laid him down to right. The way they laid him I was looking at the left side of his body as opposed to the right side of his body. I remember I could see the blood at the throat area, and in the neck area. As for as me getting down and looking at the exit hole in the front, all I could see was the blood. What I’m talking about is what I heard in conversation from them, from then on. Q: To follow that up, as you should well know because I take it you do hunt a lot, locating wounds in hair is very difficult. The sighting. Did you visibly see the wounds in the back of the head, what you feel were the entrance wounds?

I feel that there was no really entrance wound – maybe I said that – in the rear of his head. There was a point where they determined the bullet entered the back of his head but I believe all of that part of his head was blown. I mean I think it just physically blew away that part of his head. You know, just like a strip right across there or may have been just in that area – just blew it out.. LIPSEY: To the best of my recollection, yes it did. But one, the other one went in the back of the neck. Like a say, I saw the blood spots and what have you, but they weren’t tremendous, not a blow-a-way like this. But, of course, what little I know about it, which isn’t a hell of a lot, your bone is right there, so when it hit it, the bullet probably expanded, hit something solid and ripped. But here, it went in to tissue before it hit anything. LIPSEY: No. I really couldn’t. Because like I say, when we got it out, there was – blood was all over the body. It was almost caked on. I remember they took a scrub brush and a pail. One of his arms, and if I’ve not mistaken, it was his left arm. You know, the way, I guess, after he died, finished the autopsy by that time and, rigor mortis had set in and one of his arms was slightly higher. Well, the guy’s laying down and one of them was up a little bit. So when they started the autopsy I can remember, one of the doctors, when he was starting to clean the body up, got up on the table and physically got up on the table and put his knee down on his arm to hold it down – to get it out of his way – so he could scrub the rest of the body. So to say, to describe the hole to you, no. Because it was so messy and so much blood that I didn’t, I never got close enough to get down and look at the wound itself.

I couldn’t possibly describe to you the relation to the size. I don’t’ remember and I doubt that I saw it close enough to describe it to you. LIPSEY: If you want to get down to specifics: no. The only thing I do remember was when they kept talking about the entrance in the back of the neck and looking at the hole in the front of the neck. To the best of my knowledge they were convinced that a bullet came out the front of the neck. And that’s how they were determining where to look for the other bullet – by the angle it went in at the back and came out at the front. Where to look at the other one. LIPSEY: Right. Right. [Interrupting] To determine where to look for the other one, I presume from what they were looking at, both entrances looked to be the same.. In other words, both entrances – the angles were the same were on both entrances, or the sizes of the holes probably was the same – and in the front. I’m not going to stand here and make up a story, make it sound good, I just don’t remember whether they discussed the size of a trach hole or it in relation to where a bullet might have exited. LIPSEY: And they spent a lot of time on that. Because I remember when they cut him open in the front, you know, they – I remember – “Let’s look for this, let’s look for this.” They took all the organs out, they went through, they cut the organs up looking for bullets. And finally, to the best of my knowledge, and I remember this, I don’t remember how much more they did after this, but I remember them saying: “That bullet could be anywhere.” It could have gone right down to his heels or his toes. It could have ricocheted and traveled right down through right on down, you know, through his insides. LIPSEY: That’s why they spent so much time looking for it. They traced it through the back of his neck through, you know, when they did the autopsy, through the inside of his body and there was no where the bullet was then where it should have exited, it was not.

And at the angle it was traveling, and from, you know, with the other things they saw visible in the chest area once they cut him open, you know, it had started down, but where was it? LIPSEY: I’m convinced they were in the upper part of his body – yes – because that’s how they started following it. And then I think, that’s when they started taking his organs out, you know, one at a time only. They took all of the insides out, I remember that, boy. They had four or five piles of insides sitting on the table. And they thoroughly examined each one of those. They just had a big hollow chest and stomach cavity left – or particularly chest cavity, when they got through. And, I’m very convinced, in my own mind, that they were very convinced that bullet was somewhere in him. Because, from their conversations, they tracked this bullet as far as they could in a downward position before they couldn’t tell where it went. That’s when they started taking organs apart and looking where ever they could look without going ahead and just cutting him apart. And I think their decision finally was, we’re just, you know, not going to completely dissect him to find this bullet. So they tracked the bullet down as far as it went. Obviously, by that point it wasn’t that important. LIPSEY: No, no, no, no. I plead dumbness on that, I just don’t…But I remember now, them holding [mumbling] things, this long thing in series with lights. They’d examine part of an x-ray and go on from there. So, obviously, they must have taken x-rays right at the beginning. If they took any more during or after, I don’t remember. LIPSEY: No. Not from the room, but when the autopsy was over, before the men from the funeral home started their work, they took a break. Gen Wehle came in and asked if I wanted to go out for a while. Gen Wehle came into the room and I went out of the room and took 10 or 15 minutes. And called my parents and said, “Guess where I am or what I just did?” Woke them up, it was then after 2:00 in the morning.

Just, I’ve been watching the autopsy. If anybody else called…I don’t know. LIPSEY: I can remember, like I say, if he was a doctor or an orderly. Other people at particular times cleaned the body, moved the body. Certain things like that. Occasionally somebody would just come into the room, turn around and walk out, one of the hospital staff-type people. But I don’t remember who it was. I don’t remember, by name, anybody else in the room. LIPSEY: You know that’s hard because I seem to recollect one other person in there on occasion, but for the life of me, honestly, I just can’t remember who it was. I really don’t. Sam and I were sitting to try to be out of the doctor’s way and everybody else’s way. Immediately away from the table but right there in the chairs as you walk in on the right. I just don’t remember the other people who came in around at that time. LIPSEY: Specifically, no. I was charged by Gen Wehle to make sure that no body left – that body didn’t go anywhere without him or me. As far as specific security of the room on the outside, I remember they had guards all up and down that place. And Army people and all types of security people. And I don’t know who physically was responsible for hospital security. LIPSEY: No, I probably wasn’t around to be admitted. I had on my uniform and the Gen’s recognition, and the Gen and I drove and everyone realized that he was in charge. He told me to stay with the body and from then on nobody ever asked me anything. But, there was a guard right outside the door. A policeman, a Washington policeman right outside the door. LIPSEY: To the best of my knowledge, they didn’t return any thing to the body. They had these organs in separate containers. After they examined them. What they did – I left for a while when Gen.

I feel like they had did have some bullet fragments. I remember them very carefully examining the area, around the part on the side of his head where it was kinda blown away. I remember just very extremely carefully examining that part of his head and looking for things. But I not going to tell you that they took a big piece or little piece out. Sorry, I just don’t remember. LIPSEY: Excuse me, there was one other person. Like I say, I’m just trying to remember.

He could have been one of the doctors. I do remember another person. I couldn’t tell you any more about it. The only thing, and it’s certainly not going to hold up under any court of law-type thing. But, I can remember when the Warren Commission was formed. Everybody’s writing books about it. All the comments on how many times he was shot and the angles. I remember Walter Cronkite doing this big CBS thing on who shot him – how many directions it came from. I can remember vividly in my mind on literally hundreds of occasions, saying these people are crazy. I watched the autopsy and I know for a fact he was shot three times. And the doctors were firmly convinced they all came out of the same gun because of the type of wounds or the entrances, whatever. I wish I could be more specific. I remember going back to the autopsy. I can remember specifically the next week, the next month. Over the period of the next year or so. Which was when I really remember what went on in the room.

As frequent guests at Joe Banana’s Fruit Shake shop and Tony’s Up the Beach we joined the international throng dining on seafood and the simple, local fare. The relaxed, jovial atmosphere made it seem that the cream of the traveling community had found their way to Goa. Artists came with portfolios of their original work and decorated many of the houses with murals. The musically talented played exotic instruments such as the sitar, oud and vina, and the not-so-exotic guitars, drums and flutes. Spontaneous music was a daily occurrence on the porches of hippie houses. Writers, searching for perfect metaphors for a brand new scene, sent letters and articles to their far-flung families, friends and homeland media, chronicling the happenings and high jinks in Goa and beyond. These original hippies created a swirling, mesmerizing cacophony of sound and color. For Christmas we decided to throw a party. Rebecca had purchased a gallon of Canadian maple syrup at a duty-free shop on our way to India. It inspired me to use the local Portuguese sweetbread and readily available eggs for French toast. Before Christmas morning I hired four Goanese women to make huge fruit salads. We produced a unique, welcome feast for about 200 people, including Peace Corps volunteers and other travelers who heard about the party by coconut telegraph up and down the beach from as far as 50 miles away. As the party cranked into full gear, a group of us spontaneously decided to rent three canoe-style outriggers from the local shark fishermen. This turned out to be much more exciting than we bargained for. After piling a half-dozen sated and stoned partiers into the boats, and clearing the shore break, we found ourselves cruising festively in open water. The fishermen then proceeded to bring out several bottles of an illegal, powerful whiskey and launched into a celebration of their own. Gleeful at their unexpected, over-paid boat rental, they swilled liquor until they were blind drunk. These outriggers were very narrow and none of us had experience in manning such a craft – our lives were in the hands of the more and more inebriated fishermen. It was with great difficulty that we managed, by hand signals and body language, to instruct them to row us ashore at Chapora Beach for a swim. After a relaxing, enjoyable dip and a few hits off the chillum, we piled the besotted fishermen, now mostly unconscious, back into the boats and launched our ship of fools towards home– in the darkness, through shark-filled waters.

When we finally hit the beach at Heart House the party was still raging, and continued all night long. As the days flowed together during the month we spent in Goa, it became obvious that the primitive living conditions were putting an unhealthy stress on everyone’s lifestyle. Foolish hippies were eating something called Mandrax, a form of Quaalude, just to get them through the nights. Smoking prodigious amounts of hashish all day long was a common pastime. More acid arrived when members of the Brotherhood of Light from Southern California came upon the scene. Girls went topless on the beach and men wore nothing but the g-string type bathing suit preferred by the local fishermen. The local women bathed in full saris, but seemed not to mind that their scantily clad foreign sisters were bouncing around the beach. This fantastic feeling of “freedom found” was compromised by the primitive lifestyle and the spread of lice and disease. The time to move on was quickly approaching. It was in Goa that I connected with a Canadian we called Montreal Michael. Michael came up with the concept of extracting oil from hashish in an ingenious way to slide it past unsuspecting customs agents. Michael’s “bonafides” for me were his 20 or more heavy textbooks, U.N. Reports and scientific journals that he referred to as a “study library.” His mother had been a member of the LeDain Commission created by the Canadian Government to study and present recommendations to the progressive Prime Minister, the worldly Pierre Trudeau. The commissioners voted five to four against legalization in their report. Michael inherited the “study library” his mother had used in her academic examination of the history and use of cannabis. Michael had hauled these heavy books to this center of low-key hedonism, more replete with paperback novels than learned texts. He said he was going to go to Afghanistan and try to put the extraction operation together. I said I was planning to make a trip to Afghanistan as well for the ultimate horseback ride of my life and that if I saw him there I’d consider taking a look at his idea. We talked about a plan to transport hashish from legal Nepal and Afghanistan to quasi-legal Amsterdam- if only the countries in between didn’t carry a sentence of ten years’ hard labor.

It was at this time that I made a cardinal rule in my traveler’s life: no stories about acid trips. Boring. What was not boring, however, was the whisper of war between India and Pakistan. Most people arrived in and departed from Goa on large, cargo-carrying ferries that plied their trade along the coast to Bombay and back. The ship would moor a half-mile from shore and it was fascinating to see the small boats rowing out to collect the various supplies that were often just tossed overboard into the waiting vessels. He was Alejandro, a handsome Spaniard whom Rebecca and I had met at various Goa celebrations. Unfortunately he could not stand up with me, because he was so inebriated he couldn’t, well, stand up. We propped Alejandro against the life ring and Jennifer Kapoor accompanied Rebecca as maid of honor. The first mate was my best man. The brief rite was held on the open deck and highlighted by a beautiful, gigantic red sun setting into the Arabian Sea behind us. he threat of war hissed through Bombay. In 1947, the world powers had ludicrously allowed the creation of an East and West Pakistan with thousands of square miles of India in between. This untenable situation was about to be resolved, in a short but bloody conflagration. We checked into the Ambassador Hotel, then went to fight through the lines for railroad tickets towards Kathmandu. When we entered the opium den we caused quite a stir. Seeing a beautiful blonde woman such as Rebecca always caught the locals’ attention. The docents of the den spread fresh newspaper on the floor and gave us each a tin can for a pillow. Squatting next to us and filling the long opium pipe with small balls of “O,” the den wallahs instructed us to take big, full drags on the pipe. Like every drug in my experience, the first time is the best time, and I was quickly transported to blue lagoons, red sails and golden sunrises. We were offered tea and soft drinks and, of course, many opportunities to refill our pipes.

Alejandro refused to take his own advice and we left without him. We were astonished to find ourselves greeted by the dawn. It was six in the morning and the city of Bombay was rocking. We walked into the breaking day across the Square and saw thousands of prostitutes stacked in tiny cages six stories high in building after building. Everywhere small cooking fires shed an eerie glow on the swarming populace, each soul eking out a bitter survival in scenes that rivaled anything I recalled from reading “Dante’s Inferno.” We could not have been further from our small, conservative hometowns. It felt as if I had just looked into a strange mirror. Everything looks back at you differently. I had walked through a door of perception: a time shift. The hypothetical “teeming masses of Asia” had become a visible fact. We missed the train, and awoke after twenty-four hours of delirium to mankind’s most horrific nightmare reality. India and Pakistan were at war. Bombay, within striking distance of the Pakistani air force, was under blackout and all seaports and airports were closed. The entire populace seemed to be in a wild, patriotic panic. Lawlessness and chaos were breaking out in the streets. The only safe move was inland, and fast. Any seasoned traveler during that era will tell you that the best part of discovering India was the rail system. Created by the British during the Raj, railroads still employed mostly Sikhs as engineers and station managers. It was always unbelievable to newcomers that one could schedule a train trip across thousands of miles of India, a country where nothing, I repeat nothing, ever seemed to happen on time, and arrive nearly to the minute. You found your little name card placed neatly on the door to your cabin and discovered savory food and pleasant service awaiting you from employees who truly appreciated their jobs. Our first train trip, however, was not nearly so posh. We were two of twelve in a four-person cabin, emitting excessive body odor from nervous fear and the scramble to board. At Allahabad, when the train was commandeered by soldiers on their way into battle, Rebecca and I were forced to get off. We were very fortunate to find accommodations in a hotel owned by a local family revered for generations as classical musicians.

We were very fortunate to find accommodations in a hotel owned by a local family revered for generations as classical musicians. We left the confines of the hotel grounds and ventured into the central market. This led to a bizarre experience in a Muslim jewelry shop in the Allahabad souk. Rebecca and I drew a crowd of hundreds, pressing and milling outside the jewelry shop. Suddenly one of the young nephews of the store’s owner grabbed a cat-o-nine-tails, ran yelling and screaming and slashing into the pulsing throng, and beat them away from the door. Within moments the crowd would re-form to ogle the blonde Western woman. The shop owner’s volatile young toughs would again grab the cat-o-nine-tails and race out of the building flailing madly. “Taxi please” and thanks to all for pounding on the fenders and windows, too! Though the war was brief the international media reported a million dead, and the creation of the new nation of Bangladesh. The truce allowed us to get a first-class train cabin to Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. One of the propaganda tools that the Indians effectively used to rile up the population was to broadcast that the Pakistanis were trying, daily, to bomb the great shrine dedicated to love. This turned out to be beneficial to us, since there were virtually no tourists in Agra. Not only did we get our choice of the finest room in the finest hotel but, for a small fee, we were allowed into the Taj Mahal, alone, at night. On two consecutive evenings, under the dome of the Taj with our Tibetan bells and bowls, we made the musical swirls for which these instruments are so famous. On the second evening we caught up on our interrupted honeymoon in the temple built as a monument to love. We were alone, newly married and under the influence of a wonder of the world. The experience elevated our hearts and souls, leaving a sweet, recurring memory. Our next stop was another romantic spot – Udaipur in Rajasthan, home of the Floating Palace and considered one of the most beautiful places in India. We checked into a pleasant hotel with a view of the lake. A short walk revealed the cloudshrouded palace set in the middle of an island. We were, again, among the first post-war tourists moving around town and buying a few treasures. It was, nevertheless, surprising when a representative of the Maharaja of Udaipur knocked on our door, inviting us to the Floating Palace for drinks and dinner. After dinner the real fun began.

It was, nevertheless, surprising when a representative of the Maharaja of Udaipur knocked on our door, inviting us to the Floating Palace for drinks and dinner. After dinner the real fun began. The Maharaja brought out a gigantic photograph book and began serious attempts to impress Rebecca by showing her photo after photo of the tigers he had killed. Rebecca, always wearing her emotions on her sleeve, was not the most receptive of audiences. After about the fifteenth tiger the Maharaja finally noticed Rebecca’s pained, horrified expression and switched to photos of the former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who had visited the Floating Palace during her husband’s administration. She was photographed wearing a traditional Indian sari for a formal, panoramic portrait with the Maharaja, his brother, the Prince, their wives and the entire palace entourage. As the Maharaja gleefully turned the page, a new view of the beautiful sari into which Mrs. Kennedy had been so tightly wound was revealed. According to our host, the fabric had split down the back just before the photo was to be taken. The rear-view snapshot revealed the Prince grasping the back of the First Lady’s sari and holding it in place so they could get through the photo op. We took our own trip to an Indian wildlife preserve that turned out to be fantastic. While not a tiger reserve, it was home to many unusual species, particularly the Giant Siberian Red Cranes that wintered in India. It was thrilling to stroll around a bend in the jungle and spot two of these red, six-foot birds, cavorting in a mud-stomping mating dance. Next we were off to Varanasi, the old Benares and city of Lord Shiva, located on the Ganges River. Varanasi is one of the holiest places in India. It has been a place of pilgrimage since before recorded history, where all Hindus would like to breathe their last on this plane of existence. This desire was fully demonstrated as our train approached the city. At each stop, more and more corpses of those souls who had not quite made it to the Ganges were being loaded onto the train. As we approached the outskirts of Varanasi, we could see two or three corpses strapped onto the roofs of taxicabs heading towards the city center and the burning ghats on the river. On our second morning in Varanasi we were awakened by the incredible stench of death wafting into our room from the street.

As I craned my neck to peer out the window I discovered what the horrible smell was — a corpse lying below our window. I notified the hotel manager, who said he would bring in the “corpse brigade” as quickly as possible to remedy the situation. And in fact, it wasn’t long before a cart with other corpses arrived below our window. We watched the scene, unable to pull ourselves away. The men tried to throw the corpse on top of the overloaded cart, but there were so many that ours rolled off – twice. Ah, here now we witness the unique style of Indian problem solving. A fresh corpse was removed from the cart and left under our window, making room for the decaying one. A clever solution, it was explained, since the one that was left behind was fresh and wouldn’t smell so bad. “Our” corpse found its place on the top of the stack and the cart rumbled off over the cobblestones, on its way to the burning ghats. Our gawking presence at the window, looking down on the drama, was acknowledged by the brigade leader with a wave of his hand and a promise for their quick return to collect the new corpse and deliver it to the burning ghats, “this very night” … and so they did. Hindu Varanasi embraces a highly spiritual Buddhist corner. We visited Sarnath, home of Deer Park where Dharma was first preached by Buddha to five monks. We visited the Sadhu parks and watched the chillums constantly passed among the mendicants. Rickshaw was the only form of transportation available, and a quarter of a million drivers had official operator’s licenses. Our driver guided us to shops offering masala chai, tasty curries and cool, refreshing lassis, the traditional yogurt drink, bhang, made more interesting by the addition of an edible form of cannabis. I began hiring a boat, daily, and we were rowed across the mile-wide Ganges. We’d stop and I’d take a brief swim in the middle of the river where the water was clear and green. After crossing we would have a picnic on the remarkably barren shore, considering the overpopulated crowded city on the opposite side. As we ate and relaxed it was with great pleasure that we listened to the resonant gongs, lilting bells and hypnotic chants drifting across the holy waters from a multitude of spiritual temples.

Our simple, inexpensive pleasure came to an abrupt halt when I swam into a corpse. My journey with Rebecca to Asia started with a recon-nection to a musician I’d gotten to know in Chica-go. Jelly Roll Troy (given name “Roger”) was a bass player who had been on the road making a living as a musician since he was 14 years old. Jelly Roll played with a teenage sensation, one-hit-wonder group called the Kallaen Twins. The handsome brothers, riding their good looks and radio airplay, appeared on “Dick Clark’s Cavalcade of Stars Tours” with Chuck Berry, Johnny Rivers and the Rhonettes. Then in his early twenties, Jelly Roll had relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area to be part of Mike Bloomfield’s new band, which he was creating in the wake of his artistic fame with Bob Dylan and Paul Butterfield. Jelly Roll’s talents can best be heard on Bloomfield’s 1974 album, “Live from the Record Plant,” where he delivers an outstanding performance on vocals and bass. Matrix Club one Monday night in San Francisco. The set was loosey-goosey but innovative and accomplished. Jelly Roll sang a namesake blues cover, “Jelly Jelly,” in a powerful yet angelic gospel-flavored, white blues voice, displaying the broad range the blues needs to be emotionally flavored just right. The song received a standing ovation from the crowded club. Wales was making his musical living as a member of a relocated-from-the-midwest blues band known as A.B. Skhy. They had big money and promotion behind them. Because of that, A.B. Skhy had appeared at a number of desirable big-time gigs. For me it meant backstage passes for the seminal British rockers, The Who, at the Fillmore. Unfortunately for A.B. Skhy, they attempted to leave their blues roots for psychedelic experimentation on their first big budget, major label album. It was totally unsuccessful musically and financially. Howard Wales was the keyboard player in A.B. Skhy and put together a small budget for a solo album to be the first release by a new label known as Douglas Records. Jelly Roll Troy invited me to check out a session. The other players setting up their instruments when we got there were Curly Cook on guitar, Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead on lead guitar and a guy who was introduced to me as Bill Vitt, on drums. All these connections led me to enjoy being on the fringe of what came to be called the “Wales/ Garcia” album.

I started hanging around, enjoying the artistic process as it unfolded, whenever I could. The financial underpinnings of the project came from some truly gourmet marijuana that was shipped into the Wales and Garcia were pushing the musical envelope in each session. It was thrilling to hear the collaborative, artistic stretch into electronica, fusion, blues and even Stockhausen. The limited budget, unfortunately, did not allow for a continuous roll of recording tape so many magical and spontaneous moments were lost. It was also fascinating to hear Jelly Roll’s tales from the road, working for a family organization like the Kallaen Twins, and have those tales overlapped and intertwined by Garcia’s fascinating stories. Garcia had also been on the road at fifteen with a family outfit, some cousins who played bluegrass. Howard Wales, too, was a road veteran and had played behind some Motown acts. Howard had also played a memorable organ part on what became the Dead’s signature tune, “Truckin’.” Wales added his off-beat, acerbic wit to the road stories. The deal and musical direction were Wales’ idea and Garcia praised him, on more than one occasion, for his tones and abilities. In turn, Wales would chide Garcia about the quality of his sidemen and mock the Grateful Dead’s occasionally out-of-tune musical renditions. A number of times I heard him pointedly wonder if rhythm guitarist Bobby Weir could play anything other than “chinka, chinka.” The concept of the album was loose and free form with a lot of tokin’, jokin’ and frequent food breaks. One afternoon, the art for their album cover, created by Abdul Mati, was brought to the studio. Abdul Mati had done a dramatic LP cover for the Eric Clapton/Stevie Winwood English super group called Blind Faith featuring a naked, young girl holding a model airplane. Mati had created a naked young girl, holding nothing, for the Wales/Garcia album. The first desire of all musical groups is a problem-free sound system and dependable transportation. Rabid Rakow was socalled because of his ultra-wired high energy and his big deala-minute business propositions. He constantly worked on both and snapped photos of the musicians in between the proposals. Rakow’s grand scheme was to have the Grateful Dead own a corporate-style fleet of cars. The plan was to have one car for each player, manager and the sound crew. Rakow found a used-car lot full of old Hertz rental cars and bought six.

Five were for the Dead and one was for himself, for putting the deal together. My old friend, Big Red Ted saved me from being “volunteered” to drive one of the junkers off the lot. As I was leaving, Garcia gave me a patch that read “Keep on Truckin’ .” As he lit a cigarette from a cigarette, he added, “Get it sewed on something … it’s somebody’s idea … to promote the Dead.” Ted showed up at the studio with excitedly-offered apologies and dragged me out of the session. On the way to the parking lot he told me that a Tibetan Lama had been smuggled into the U.S. from Canada and was hiding from the powers that be, including Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The State Department had an all-points bulletin out on the Lama just to appease the Communist Chinese. Ted said Nixon was going to play the “China Card” to get re-elected and Kissinger was going to make a big deal about deporting this Lama back to occupied Tibet as a diplomatic symbol of potential political cooperation between the two nations. I felt obliged to help my persuasive, concerned friend help this Lama. My knowledge of Tibetan history, religion and politics was limited. I had read one chapter on Buddhism while taking a course on comparative religions when I went to college. Tibet I could find on a map. Ted said I would get a rush course and the Cliff Notes version on the way to a suitable hiding place. Ted suggested the Sierra Nevada Mountains, being similar to the geography of Tibet, might ease the fugitive Lama’s mind. It was summertime and fairly easy to secure a ski cabin in the Lake Tahoe area. Being off-season, the ski chalet only had a small TV, AM radio and paper plates. I explained sit-com TV and the rules of baseball. In halting English he explained the Path and how he meditated to physically change the brain for positive happiness; how to “center” oneself. By the fourth baseball game Tarthang Tulku was seriously impressed by the variety of skills necessary to be a baseball player … throwing, hitting and especially running down a long fly-ball.

During the next week, while attending to the Lama, I received a simple education in practical Buddhism from this incredible man who had traveled many a hard mile. He gave me unusual perspectives on life by debating intellectual thought. Tibetans are great debaters and much of their learning is tested in high-powered and energetic debates. The Lama posed problems and spoke philosophically and in metaphors. His teachings would begin with a statement – such as, “you must go into the Tibetan mind, the mind that believed in times past that thunder comes from the roar of a dragon, to consider what I am now going to tell you.” He taught me the Tibetan style of theological and philosophical debate wherein points are emphasized by slapping one’s palm with the back of one’s other hand. This ritualistic part of the debate, he informed me, keeps the debate from getting too emotional and being reduced to a rigid argument rather than a fluid exchange of thought. I was able to work in a good hike and swim every day in Lake Tahoe while the Lama did his meditations. After about ten days, Ted returned and told me he had made other living arrangements. An underground accommodation for Lama Tarthang Tulku seemed safe in Berkeley. Former Peace Corps volunteers had offered refuge. A young woman handled the paperwork for the rented boat dockside. The way the sun caught her golden tresses and healthy glow, she looked angelic. Her reaction to the burgundy-andgold robed gentleman, carefully off-loading an ornate prayer box, was as if a Tibetan Lama arrived every hour or so. As Ted settled the bill, I officially ended my monkish period by throwing out a couple of my best lines. The lovely lass threw back a general invitation to a party that night with some of her college friends who were doing the “summer job in Tahoe thing.” Rebecca and I were inseparable, although sometimes only in spirit, from that night on. She gave her employer two weeks notice and joined me in the Bay Area. Early in our relationship together, a hint of a previous romantic crush began to leak into our conversations. Though she had never met him, it seemed (to my ever more acute ears) that she had an infatuation with Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. I knew a way to stomp any further thoughts of him out of my new love’s head. I wrangled an invitation into one of the last of the Wales/Garcia sessions and said I was going to bring a big fan.

My plan was, at some point, to throw a few leading lines to Howard Wales that would set up one of his bitter, twisted remarks, hopefully, about Bobby Weir and his “chinka, chinka.” When we got to the studio, however, it was not the first, nor the last time, that I would see a musical collaboration that had changed totally and completely. Being in Tahoe and focused on the teachings of the lama, I hadn’t known that Jelly Roll Troy had been in a coma as a result of a gastro-intestinal attack. Though Jelly had recovered, there were near-death consequences. Jerry Garcia had brought John Kahn in to replace him on bass. Garcia had quite obviously taken over leadership and direction of not only the musicians, but the recording sessions. He was pushing hard for completion of the new album. There were no Bobby Weir “chinka, chinka” jokes from Howard, so as the session ended I foolishly and childishly blurted out Weir’s name, caught myself and shut up. Garcia casually replied that they always put Weir in the front-middle of the Grateful Dead promotion photos because “Bobby is the best-looking guy in the band.” After the unrelenting difficulty of travel across India,part of which included the specter of war, Kathmandu ty and Ted and Cathy, were already there as previously agreed. We checked into the Snow Lion Hotel, famous for being the headquarters of Sir Edmund Hillary at the time he undertook his first successful ascent of Mt. Everest with the Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay. Other hotels had their own history and attributes. The black market money exchange was in the Panorama. Hash and ganja came by room service at the Inn Eden. Life was very simple and very primitive. It was necessary to take appropriate precautions to stay healthy. Going to market, carefully shopping and cooking, boiling drinking water, and house keeping were necessary activities and yet there was still plenty of time for enjoying meals with friends and exploring the exotic culture. The whole valley ran out of food about eight at night and provisions would not be available until the trucks arrived with produce the next morning. One day the Hog Farm bus, with Wavy Gravy as its admiral, limped into Kathmandu, infusing the scene with a whiz-bang but somewhat weary energy.

Nepalese bus drivers enjoy pointing out to the Western tourists the unreachable remains of all types of vehicles that didn’t make it across, including other buses with less astute drivers. Unfortunately, Wavy and his wife, Billy Jean, would soon have to leave for a U.S. hospital due to Wavy’s bad back. One of the Hog Farmers was Dr. Larry Brilliant – a genuine M.D. and counter-culture hero, and he insisted Wavy must go home. Soon after the Hog Farmers arrived, a Mercedes-Benz van, driven by a guy known as German Ted, pulled into the stupa area. He and his wife, Tory, had with them the first Afghan mastiff that I had ever seen, an incredibly fantastic specimen of the canine world. I approached Ted and found out that he had acquired the dog in Afghanistan where the breed was rare and had, for centuries, been guard dogs for the caravans. I determined then that I would, someday, have one of those proud, majestic beasts. It was at this time in Kathmandu that we all became aware of the plight of the Tibetans. But first, I began a quest to find some hash to potentially smuggle to Amsterdam. Since it was legal, I had very few problems obtaining it; but the Nepalese were quite adept at controlling its leaving their country. Nonetheless, in my explorations, I established some valuable connections with customs officials, and other government appointees, who would later prove beneficial in ways that had nothing to do with hashish smuggling. Our home, the Double Dorge, was a sprawling 150-year-old structure that, like all houses in the valley, had ceilings that were less than six feet tall. Hog Farm bus rider, Milan Melvin, shared half the house with us. Milan had a long, checkered history on the scene. He was one of the first underground disc jockeys to play rock and roll music on FM radio in San Francisco in the late ’60s. One night, on the air, he made the startling announcement that he had been an FBI informant infiltrating anti-war activists. After a personal 180, Melvin married the sister of Joan Baez – Mimi Farina. While the marriage was short-lived, it did give Milan an odd credence that weighed against his former informant career. Our next-door neighbor was an attractive Canadian woman dubbed “Buddy Lynn” for her easy manner with males. She introduced me to General Wangdoo.

The General was one of the heads of the Khampa resistance – guerillas who were fighting on behalf of Tibet and funded by the CIA. They were located in the Mustang Province at the outermost reaches of the Nepalese-Tibet border. I spent afternoons at Buddy Lynn’s Bodha house, fascinated and intrigued by Wangdoo’s tales of life and the battles that he had fought, which were, militarily, only a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communists. His story began as a CIA “recruit” with seven other teenage Tibetan boys. In 1959, after training in Colorado for high-altitude mountain work, the teens were parachuted back into Tibet with radios strapped on their backs for the purpose of starting the first resistance cells. According to General Wangdoo, he was the only one of the eight who survived that first drop. Also, it became apparent in his tales that he was a CIA favorite because he grasped that they desired paper more than body counts. His guerilla outfit would raid storage depots and remote Chi-Com military outposts and General Wangdoo would come out with information, such as how many gallons of diesel fuel were being used to supply the convoys that brought the Chinese military up into Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. The CIA spooks were much more desirous of this kind of information and numbers to sift. The guerilla attacks were mostly on the re-supply convoys. Buddy Lynn eventually turned Wangdoo on to LSD and cocaine and bragged about having sex with him. It was also the General’s great pleasure to hear any music by Jimi Hendrix. Another twist in the story was the General’s appearance. While at training school in Colorado, he was shown many John Wayne and other “Cowboys and Indians” movies for entertainment at night. The General, not speaking any English at the time, coudn’t understand the dialogue, so he didn’t know the “good guys” from the “bad.” He adopted the costume style of The Duke’s adversaries, i.e., the Mexican banditos, and wore pants with conchos down the sides and bandoliers of bullets slung across his chest, a Tibetan Pancho Villa in fine attire. Rebecca and I made our initial attempts at trekking in Nepal by going up to Nagarkot, the first high ground out of the valley where one could have a clear view of the majesty of Mount Everest.

Buddy Lynn married General Wangdoo. She whispered to me after the vows that she would set it up for me to accompany them to the Mustang area where the guerilla army was headquartered. The only Tibetan fighters I’d seen were the ones that hung around Lynn’s Bodha home. They would come and go at the General’s bidding with fistfuls of hundred-dollar bills supplied by the CIA. The General told me that a one-hundred-dollar bill, in Mustang, bought one pound of rice. Like the value of the money, “everything” he said, “was totally out of control.” To his dismay, audio cassette players with big speakers had been rolled into the guerilla camps and a speech by the Dalai Lama was broadcast calling for a peaceful resolution, and an end to the attacks on the Communist Chinese. Three days after their marriage, Buddy Lynn was attempting to continue behaving like a Western woman in a typical Western marriage. The General, however, thought that Lynn’s wifely duties should consist exclusively of cleaning, cooking and doing the laundry. No more Western visitors and no more intellectual and historical discussions were permitted with their neighbors. He expressed this philosophy by grabbing Lynn behind the neck and frog-marching her out of our Double Dorge house right in front of us. It was the last time we saw the General. Within weeks, he and his main mobile attack force were ambushed and killed in a high mountain pass by Nepalese army sharpshooters. utch Bob tried to recruit anyone of worth he met in the Kathmandu Valley to assist him in his Hash-to-Amsterdam deals. “I come from a small country that must hold back the sea to exist. We have been forced to go far from our loving homes and deal in spices to survive,” was his sales pitch. “Tea, saffron, cinnamon, hashish or coffee … any and all spices,” he added, like a snake oil salesman, mumbling and choking on “hashish” every time he pitched it. “Amsterdam and Holland will lead the citizens of the planet from old laws and prisons to freedom and legalization. Help us!” Dutch Bob pleaded, adding, “Nepalese diplomats have had a long, successful hash smuggling history.

Although I was opposed to the idea of dealing with diplomats because of the potential betrayal from that kind of intrigue, I went along. I needed money. He insisted that if the hash clubs in Amsterdam were not supplied with the product, they would not be able to stay in business. And from the first two clubs, there were now nearly ten … strength in numbers was the idea. Bob had instructed me to go to the National Olympic Stadium when I arrived in Amsterdam and take a sauna on Tuesday afternoon, the day that the stadium was free and open to the public. Someone would give me a red tie to wear and then the money. I made my way there but found that the facilities had been taken over by the Dutch police, who maintained control of “open day” by giving the evil-eye and the cold-shoulder treatment to any and all. I enjoyed the sauna, took the cold plunge and ignored the vacant stares of the police. No one contacted me, no red tie – nothing but an unsettling experience. I went back to the hotel and telegraphed Bob that I had a wonderful bath and nothing more. He telegraphed back to me that I should return on Thursday. There would be a pass at the door. The pass was waiting for me and I went into the locker room and undressed. My first thought was that the man approaching me was a locker room attendant. He tossed me a gym bag and said “On your way, druggie, don’t use this place! What are you doing here, are you some kind of American hippie?” Then he left. Inside the bag was a red tie. I got dressed, put on the red tie and headed out of the Olympic Stadium. As soon as I got outside the door, I noticed that the same fake locker room attendant was waiting. He said, “May I offer you a ride back into town?” When I got into the back seat of the car, there sat the Nepalese diplomat. We rode into Amsterdam and other than “very nice tie,” little was said. I was given an ornate box that was filled with Dutch guilders, “for local expenses.” I telegraphed Bob that the first part of the arrangement had been completed and he directed me, by return wire, to a travel agent where there", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BK007PRINTs_cleaned.txt:15:2cf9c47f804b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4720, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BK007PRINTs_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bandit-Kabul-Counterculture-Adventures-Hashish/dp/1936296020", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BK007PRINTs_cleaned", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "He said, “May I offer you a ride back into town?” When I got into the back seat of the car, there sat the Nepalese diplomat.

The destination on the plane ticket was Saigon, Vietnam. One would imagine that Saigon, in the middle of the Vietnam War, would not be the first choice for a business meeting, but in fact, anybody could come and go at their own risk. Except for the tension one felt in human interactions, most of the sprawling city showed no signs of war. I met Dutch Bob and two other Hollanders at The Continental, an old French-colonial hotel. I was somewhat stunned at the way my share of the profits was remitted. Proudly the Hollanders showed me that they had managed to obtain some “ice cold” Heineken beers and proceeded to pay me in gold, which, they said, was “better than money.” At the time of this transaction, the Vietnamese had been at war for about 30 years, first against the Japanese, then the colonial French occupation and now the United States. This period of conflict had long established an economy based on gold. Not only were the pieces of gold precise in weight, they were molded into a curved shape to fit the contours of the human body and slide into thin leather belts for transport. I flew out of Saigon with gold strapped all over my body. When I got to Hong Kong, I quickly detached myself from the situation and sold the gold for about 80 cents on the dollar. I missed my sweetheart and worried about her waiting in a wild corner of the world.

Gucci was the most popular boutique. The American Express office, where all nationalities received mail, was located high up in one of those skyscrapers. The panoramic view it presented revealed a modern, suburban, American-like development surrounding Bangkok that was being furiously constructed from money fueled by the Vietnam War. South Africans, Italians and the French were making nice profits off that war, as were Americans from every state. All were cashing checks, buying traveler’s checks or wiring funds back home. News and gossip flowed as fast as the indexing of international currencies. Bangkok was mainly a pass-through plane hub on the way to somewhere else. There were two or three hotels that accommodated the pilots and airline personnel, as well as most of the passengers, who were just transiting through. One notorious hotel was The Malaysia. It was infamous for its junkie clientele and Thai hangers-on. Another hotel featured great ganja connections. We chose to stay for a couple of nights at the hotel known for its weed connection, to get our hands on some herb. Once that was accomplished we moved to the classy Oriental Hotel, which was an inexpensive four-star wonder. The Oriental had four bungalows built as high-end suites in the early 1900s. Rattan ceiling fans, bamboo shutters, a king-sized bed, mosquito nets and night ginger wafting in on a Chao Phraya River breeze are undeniable aphrodisiacs. The opposite of loving sex was a constant presence, however. Almost every male we met had a beautiful bar girl on his arm. Most of these sex toys were painfully young and came from the tribal highlands, sold by their starving families to Cholon Chinese agents. The prettiest girls went into the local “escort” trade, while the less fortunate were shuffled off to Arab seaport brothels. The girls were given a few days of training and then sent out to work under heavily controlled circumstances.

A girl would generally stay with the man who paid her “bar fee” for as long as he was in the country. It wasn’t unusual to see two or three such escort girls at dinner or any social situation. All of the nightlife took place in the infamous Patpong Road area. This two-block wide and six-block long strip had clubs with names such as “Mississippi Queen,” “Chicago Gangsters” and “Super Star.” The strip was electronic-neon excess gone wild. Video screens and computer light shows were found here and recorded rock and roll blared out of the clubs. American soldiers on R&R mixed it up with Danish engineers, Middle Eastern merchants, Japanese electronic experts, and international travelers like us. The males sported sweet young things on their arms. Anyone could get a small bag of second-rate ganja from the circling cab drivers. Barkers hawked clubs with weird sex shows … “see a pussy smoke a cigarette” … or promising an up-close view of girls shooting ping-pong balls out of their vaginas. “Hey Joe … inside you gonna’ see a pussy drink Coca-Cola and then you drink the Coca-Cola …!” A herd of staggering soldiers and sailors eagerly paid money for the privilege. This was their “recreation” after six weeks in the killing zone. Subic Bay in the Phillipines was even more depraved. The restaurants offered an astounding array of culinary delights derived from the European countries of their “warrich” clients. There was a German hofbrau, a French bistro, a Swedish smorgasbord and an American cheeseburger shack. Rebecca and I absorbed the scene, but after an hour’s worth of loud Rolling Stones and Otis Redding, and a wonderful meal at one of the many ethnic restaurants strung around the area, we’d had enough. The following morning we took an escorted tour through the museum, the King’s palace grounds and a major Buddhist temple that was home to a fiveton gold statue. It was a rich historical and cultural experience, the exact opposite of the previous evening. We barely had time to digest the magnificent artisanship of Thailand’s past, or the exotic architecture of the royal enclave before we were notified that we had a four-hour window of opportunity to get on a plane to Kabul. he house we were lucky enough to find was actually an estate consisting of four acres enclosed within a 24-foot high, 3-foot thick mud wall.

A nephew of the King, who had been sent to Oxford University in England in the 1950s, built it after he returned to Afghanistan and realized the value of good water. He located the estate where the Kabul River flows out of the mountains. The home was Tudor style with two bathrooms that had Japanese bathtubs and regular European-style flush toilets, a rare and welcome amenity in 1970s Afghanistan. On the grounds was a stable, with quarters for a groom as well as a combination gate and guard-house. We enjoyed a beautiful garden and grape arbor and there was an area for children to play, with a jungle gym, slide and sandbox. The children of our Western guests were always delighted by the familiarity. The owner was the great-grandson of the original builder and was the current Deputy Prime Minister of Afghanistan. Our oasis was located on the far edge of Kabul proper, half a kilometer from an edifice that was built to honor the defeat of Alexander the Great by the Afghan people – Jangalak – the battle of 100,000. “Lak” is the Farsi word for 100,000. I followed our landlord’s instructions to Diplomat Row in Kabul in an attempt to find a cook and other staff to run our estate. The 24-Hour Service recommended a chef named Abdul, who had worked at the Intercontinental Hotel until he was fired when caught smoking hashish. I scooped him up and brought him out to the house to have him prepare an “audition” dinner and then hired him on the spot. He quickly became one of the most valuable cogs in the wheel of our daily life, contributing to our healthy, happy existence. He was well trained in German, French and traditional Afghan cuisine, and Rebecca taught him how to cook Mexican food. Ghiaz’s story was that he took the train to Iran with as much hash as he could carry. He jumped off the moving caboose into the border area no-mans land and walked the herb dangerous into a small village where it was transferred to his European employers. Iranian law meted out a sentence of death by torture for Afghans caught smuggling anything. To Ghiaz, by comparison, the opposite direction through the Khyber Pass was a “walk in the park.” Sakhi grew up in Balkh. For centuries Balkh was home to the world’s best hash pollen farmers and hand pressers. Sakhi took Mark, myself, Ghiaz and his horse Sultan north to show us what he had access to.

He carried an old flintlock rifle for protection everywhere we went. Afghanistan’s national game of buzkashi, played with the carcass of a headless, hoofless calf or goat, is well known around the world. It is a rough and dangerous cousin of polo that tests the skills and endurance of man and horse. I set out to find a buzkashi horse to ride. I found a beautiful white stallion and, against the Afghani tradition of naming a horse after its color, I named this one “Sazz” – or music – for his tremendously strong yet smooth gait. He was perfectly trained. Sazz, only recently retired from the game, became a beloved member of our family, though I sometimes thought he missed the games. Sazz certainly loved to run. The gardener also served as the resident caretaker of the estate and he was happy to continue his role when we rented the house. He lived on the estate and maintained it for the Deputy Prime Minister, who used it primarily for his daughters to romp and play behind the walls in the children’s playground. Honoring a different Afghani tradition, I hired Rustan, a eunuch, to perform the role of a traditional housekeeper and cleaner. I was able to find a small, well-trained Bamiyan breed of horse we named Red Flame for Rebecca to ride. This led to our first big cultural problem. Women were strictly forbidden to ride horses. On our first horseback ride, we were greeted by a hail of rocks at Karta-i-sah, the first village beyond our home. Our next ride through Karta-i-sah village was without incident. However, at Kartasang, the last village before the Kabul River dropped from the mountains, we had another screaming, pelting attack. This frenzied mob even included some women. Rebecca raced off and my response was careful and quick … a surprise taste of village-square destruction for Kartasang. This couldn’t go on, of course, without escalating, so I implored my landlord, the Deputy Prime Minister, to hold a jirga, or council, with the headman of each village and explain that my wife was a Western girl and we would be riding through their villages. We would not tolerate being stoned. Both headmen eventually agreed to the Deputy Prime Minister’s superior political pressure; however, we all had to go to each village and conduct a charade where the headmen fervently waved their arms and shouted it was forbidden.

The Deputy Prime Minister explained to me, on the way home, that without this theatrical show each man would have signed his own death warrant by beheading or the stoning stake. Rebecca and I were invited to visit Lahore by a freakygroup of actors who came through Kabul and charmed talent, wit, and wild looks. The theatrical troupe was a counterculture sensation in Italy and had just appeared in the Fellini film Roma. Their fame stemmed from a brilliant scene in Fellini’s groundbreaking blockbuster Satyricon. These artistes ended up in Lahore by signing a three-movie deal portraying drug-dealing hippies in Pakistani films. Lahore was actually quite cosmopolitan. There was a thriving gay scene that was totally open and tolerated. We spent about five days there at a wonderful house with beautiful hanging gardens. Hashish was openly smoked in a few places where modern rhythm-oriented Pakistani music was played. Though rare, there were two or three very privileged women in attendance. This was a perk of being a female star in Pakistan– you could go out in public in the company of foreigners and listen to music. After a while, I left Rebecca in the safety of the film colony and went up to meet Montreal Michael in Islamabad. Dominated by the Grand Peace Mosque, the capital, Islamabad, was created in the fifties and modeled after American western communities. All the rambling, ranch-style homes had a big front yard, a driveway with garage, and eight-foot high picture windows in front. But unlike the idyllic American sit-com original, the fences were topped by razor wire, all the picture windows were covered with massive anti-theft grills and the garages were permanently boarded over. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was the very progressive Prime Minister who was running things in Pakistan. Bhutto had graduated with honors from the University of California in 1950 and was admitted to Oxford. He embraced the American Federalist system and professed a dream of melding the five distinct tribal areas into one modern state. Many first-generation Pakistani leaders were heavily influenced by their Western education in the U.S. of the 1950s. Prime Minister Bhutto made a fatal error in his political maneuvering. There was a great jockeying for what the official language of the new Pakistan would be. The common man’s lingua franca of Pakistan is Urdu, a multi-ethnic muslim language that developed out of the military in the 19^(th) century.

The common man’s lingua franca of Pakistan is Urdu, a multi-ethnic muslim language that developed out of the military in the 19^(th) century. Bhutto preferred Sind, a beautiful old language spoken in only one part of Pakistan by the intelligentsia and wealthiest class. Choosing Sind to be the national language was a grave political miscalculation on Bhutto’s part. He went from being the darling of the military establishment after the 1971 war, to facing trumped-up charges that sent him to the gallows. The poetic Sind language brought to mind Pakistani art and culture and was spoken by the cinema community in Lahore. Urdu symbolized Islamabad’s nailed-shut garage doors and dry swimming pools, and was the metaphor for a backwards march toward religious fundamentalism. Montreal Michael had been in Islamabad for six months and was slowly but surely assembling the components necessary to distill pollen and create hash oil from the city’s scientific supply outlets. It was a tedious and unpleasant task but he was undaunted and determined to see his hash oil dream factory built. Michael met two other Canadians in Islamabad buying laboratory equipment at a scientific supply outlet for the same purpose. Cadillac and the Mad Professor were from British Columbia and, sharing the same nationality and the same purpose, they became associates. We all went out for kabobs and info exchange. We talked it through, always admiring the great, though somewhat bizarre, entrepreneurial skills of anyone who could come up with an idea like this. The Mad Professor, in a kindly manner, explained that Montreal Michael, while a genius, would never be able to build the elaborate factory that he was contemplating. He said the seals that were needed to secure the lab pipe-works were not made well enough in Asia, and thus were dangerously unreliable. They would not be able to handle the engineering tasks Michael was designing. The Mad Professor suggested a smaller, slower version that produced an ounce of hash oil a day, instead of a gallon an hour. The Cadillac offered to share the blueprints. utch Bob made “arrangements” through some Dutch D Embassy fringe employees to pay off Karachi customs officials. Every three or four months I would put the overland Kabul-to-Karachi trip together. Dutch Bob took it airport-to-airport into Europe after that.

Between meetings with Dutch Bob I found time to fly back to the States to visit my friend Bill Wassman. Bill had purchased the top floor of an old warehouse in New York City’s SoHo district. It was a 4400 sq. ft., well-lit skeleton. He had a double bed, a coffee pot and a refrigerator. I brought in a futon, blanket and pillow as a house-warming present. An actor named Robert De-Niro bought the floor below to fix up for his mother, Bill said. Bill and I went out to Max’s Kansas City club to hear Lou Reed with his new band, but we couldn’t get into the place. Outside in the crowd, also unsuccessful in gaining entrance, was a tall, good-looking blond man about our age who was wearing a baseball cap from the same university we had attended. It was The Sizzler. We all ended up back at Bill’s artiste primitive loft and got to know each other over some Durban “poison” weed. The Sizzler knew a sailor. The sailor knew somebody who knew somebody on the docks in Brooklyn. Every few months Sizzler visited the sailor in New York City. The Sizzler then drove South African herb 1200 miles to Chicago. Anyone who does business based on finding loopholes in various nations’ laws generally takes the historical view of it all, and the romantic characters involved with the herbe dangereuse, as the French call it, must be chivalrous and honorable and streetwise. The Sizzler was just such a guy. The $30, 000 to $40, 000 cash that would come back to Afghanistan from Amsterdam had to be carried securely on his person. Once, he retraced the overland bus route through Iran, ruled by the ruthless Shah, who employed vicious SAVAK (Secret Police) torture squads. Other times the Sizzler would come directly into Kabul by plane. The Sizz could have, on a given occasion, said he had lost the money by theft, corrupt customs or even legal confiscation. Every penny made it every time. Also, on the U.S. transit, I reconnected with a couple of old friends from Haight-Ashbury – William VIII and Aggie. William VIII was an accomplished musician who played the bass. He had been the driving force behind organizing our failed attempt at a way-too-psychedelic rock and roll band. William VIII and Aggie were inspired to come to Afghanistan and showed up within a month.

William VIII and Aggie were inspired to come to Afghanistan and showed up within a month. When I returned to Afghanistan, German Ted, hiswife Tory and their child, Guava, had come back as diately enlisted him into helping me search for a mastiff pup, and so “Kachook” came into our lives. Kachook was just eight weeks old when Ted took me up to Bamiyan, to locate one of the breed. Where Kachook was actually born is unknown. He was stolen, and had spent the previous two weeks tied to a caravan cart in a walk-for-your-life-or-death situation. The nomads that stole him had sold him to a local Wali the night before German Ted and I arrived. The local Wali had bought him to become a fighting dog, what the Afghans called sak-jungee. There were some histrionic Afghan-style negotiations involved. German Ted, invoking local custom, made the point that it was very, very good luck for the Wali to make a profit so quickly. I saw Kachook’s incredible intelligence immediately and he soon amazed all of our Afghan staff when he quickly learned to obey commands. He had four acres to run around in and was a delight from day one. His appearance at my whistle and his obedience to commands had the same effect on our Afghan household as if a circus tiger had walked in and leaped through a ring of fire. Rebecca and I worked very hard to gentle his nature at every training opportunity. As spring arrived, I was putting plans together for my dream ride up the old Silk Trail. The Sizzler, who took me at my word and eventually showed up in Afghanistan, and Montreal Michael began gearing up for the ride. I knew we needed a gun for protection so I completed an application to hunt Pamir sheep in the foothills of the Hindu Kush. It cost $2, 500 for a license to shoot one of these beasts, which I had no intention of doing, but it allowed me to import a gun for the purpose of hunting and, in our case, protection. Alejandro, my almost-Best Man of Goa, also turned up in Afghanistan and was healthy and effervescent. Tory let him borrow her horse and German Ted and I had a ride with him that broke out into a dead-run race. Later that night we heard he was arrested during the first known drug-squad sweep in Kabul.

Tory and Rebecca made immediate contact with the Spanish Embassy and discovered it was true that Alejandro had been caught with 29 grams of golden pollen. There was nothing immediate I could contribute to the situation. The planning and preparations for the ride were complete. I had also, on a previous visit to the States, arranged shipment to Afghanistan of some much better saddles that were designed for the U.S. mounted Park Rangers. These are fine saddles, very light and practical. The wooden, carpet-covered saddles of Afghanistan were yet another illustration of how far back in the centuries we were actually living. The horses were fit and freshly shod as we rode out – myself, Sizz, Michael and Kachook, dog-trotting alongside. All along the route, at intervals of four to six hours, we found fortress-like cities that served as rest stops for caravans along the trade route. We rode into the clay-walled cities of ancient times where the people lived on one level inside the 30-foot walls and the animals in dug-out enclosures below. We never knew what would be available to eat; often only a few chunks of lamb, spinach and rice or millet. Kachook was quite the sensation in each village, where they had, at best, a cur tied up at the fortress gate to act as sentinel and bark warnings to alert the villagers of approaching traders or strangers. We reached the Ajanta Pass in three days. At the bottom of the Ajanta Pass we met another couple on horseback coming from the opposite direction. They were Jittendra and Beth, and they had undertaken the ride unarmed and in complete safety, according to them, by being willing to move slowly and wait to be escorted, family by family and village to village along the old road. It had taken them thirty days to do what we did in three. We were spending a fourth night resting our horses at the bottom of the pass before heading back to Kabul. Jittendra and Beth’s horses needed far more rest before they could make the hard three days ahead of them. Everything they were wearing they made themselves. Beth was from Maine, Jittendra from Scotland, and together they had been on the road for five years, trading and moving East. They had lived the true traveler’s life together, starting out from Jittendra’s Scottish homeland.

It was during our return from Ajanta Pass, about six hours out of Kabul, that I found the stud horse of my breeding dreams. He was a three-year-old Waziri stallion. These wonderful animals have beautifully arched necks and ears that touch each other when raised and are similar to the Tennessee walking horse. I put down as much money as I could spare and we arranged to meet and buy the stallion in Paghman in a week. The agreed price was the maximum for a good horse – yak lak or 10,000 U.S. dollars. When we arrived home after the short but intense adventure I discovered that William VIII and Aggie had shown up, having taken me up on my invitation. They quickly learned some Farsi and William VIII volunteered to take a shipment of hash to Dutch Bob in Karachi. But after successfully shepherding the load across the Khyber Pass, a desolate, violent wasteland, he took his pay and said “once is enough.” He was going to study Persian poetry and become accomplished on the oud, an Afghan stringed instrument. “I was scared and stressed so bad,” said William VIII, “I pissed blood by the time I got to Karachi.” We settled into steadily working on expanding some form of legitimate business. I employed five tailors who turned out Chinese silk brocade harem pants and these garments found a niche through a distributor in Frankfurt. Also, we settled into brainy, solid relationships. Jittendra and Beth joined German Ted, Tory and their growing toddler, Guava, along with William VIII and Aggie, now pregnant, all mixing with a cast of ever-changing, international travelers. Those truly liberated women enjoyed the desert wind in their faces while astride magnificent horses, cantering freely. They held the belief that they were furthering the cause of all women. ne important thing must be known to understand how pleasant life was in a country most people considered still in the Stone Age. The King of Afghanistan owned a huge farm that rivaled the greatest estates of the world. He had outlets in Kabul known as the King’s Stores, selling everything from strawberries to succulent lamb and seasonal vegetables – spinach, lettuce, potatoes and legumes. The King’s farm fed hundreds of people, from Diplomat Row to the Royal Family’s immediate, high-level bureaucrats as well as a few health-conscious free life-style international artists and adventurers.

Another highlight of life in Kabul was the annual King’s championship buzkashi match held in the National Stadium, played by the world’s greatest horsemen. For a week before the event, there was a buzz of excited anticipation around the King’s Stores where the healthy hipsters mixed with embassy worker bees. The locals regaled us with eyewitness stories of daring, brilliant feats of horsemanship on superior animals performing at their highest level. So it was strange when we did not see anyone around the entrance to the Stadium on the day we attended. Every foreigner living in Kabul was at the Annual Royal Buzkashi match. Rebecca and I were pulled out of the crowd and invited by a member of the security guard for the Royal Court to sit in the King’s box and view the wild action of that incredible athletic event. We sat up there with men in suits and ties who joked about it all. The nephew of the King and his cronies were the only ones in the box besides us. We eventually figured out that the beautiful blonde and I were stand-ins for international diplomats who for some reason could not attend. Nevertheless, we enjoyed having the best seats in the house. Afghanistan is heat and dust, so the two mounted electric fans in the box were a “royal” touch. The official Royal Photographer took us down to the edge of the arena, where the action was. He snapped two black and white photos of the match and promised to have copies made to sell to us. After the buzkashi match, we met “Billy Batman” and his wife in the midst of the anarchy that passed for a taxi stand on the edge of the stadium grounds. They were legendary in Kabul, having survived there since 1969. Billy was older than all of us, and it was said he brought hash into New York City in the late 1950s and supplied it to authors and poets, including Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs as well as jazz greats and stage stars. We enjoyed listening to his tales of the beatnik era. Billy Batman pointed to Hector, the man you see pictured on the cover of white Zig-Zag rolling papers, as his role model. Hector’s picture was on the Zig-Zag wrapper because he was the man who brought hashish to Paris in the 1920s. His hash was enjoyed by the “Lost Generation” of Hemingway, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and, of course, the hash-brownie creator, Alice B. Toklas.

His hash was enjoyed by the “Lost Generation” of Hemingway, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and, of course, the hash-brownie creator, Alice B. Toklas. Billy Batman earned the name because of a new technique he created for making hashish. He became interested in me because I had hired a full-time gardener just to tend our cannabis plants and had brought Mexican Gold seeds into Afghanistan. I was conducting my own botanical experiments. I always preferred smoking marijuana to hashish, and the only way you could do that in Afghanistan was to grow your own. Billy had invented what he called “The Batman Technique.” He purchased heavy vinyl that was made in Germany and he put hash pollen into the vinyl, wrapped it up and tied it off with tape so that it was about the size of a baseball. He then took a Pakistani shoe mallet and slowly tapped the ball all over, bit by bit. As the heat built up inside the vinyl-covered ball, the pollen liquified. The ball had to be tapped slowly because the vinyl could split and destroy the entire, painstakingly produced product. But if one did it properly, the liquid congealed. When allowed to cool and carefully unwrapped, the resulting product was the most perfect form of hashish imaginable. A few days later, when I picked up my photos from the Royal Photographer, any feelings of honor or privilege that I may have felt from our selection to view the buzkashi match from the Royal Box vanished. The photographer explained that nearly every year someone tried to assassinate the King and his family. Following our departure, a hand grenade was thrown into the Royal Box but, fortunately, did not explode. Three Afghans were killed that day and many more injured, he said … trampled to death by the surging, frenzied crowds. The next morning, I saddled up my horse and took a ride along the river up into the mountains above the Kabul valley. When I returned, Abdul, as usual, had prepared a wonderful breakfast of melon, berries, an omelet and tea served with toasted Afghan bread. Afghan bread is delicious and looks like a giant snowshoe. With butter on it, it tastes like popcorn. In Kabul’s wide-open money bazaar there were 95 booths, and for a small percentage you could exchange any form of currency in the world for any other.

It is also the place where Genghis Kahn killed nearly a million people. A little more about Coo: he was the smoking saint of Afghanistan whose name was always invoked by Afghans before smoking hashish, similar to a toast when drinking alcohol. To Coo, life is always gardens and flowers and it is always spring. Marco Polo references Coo in his journals and admits to enjoying hash with him many times outside the gates of the city of Balkh. Since it was the season, I drove up to Kundus to see the game of buzkashi played up there. Each of the eight Afghan provinces had its team. Boys deemed to be worthy of participating in the game were trained from a very early age. As part of the training the boys were struck on the backs of their hands with buzkashi whips, one time for each year of their age. This was considered to be necessary preparation for enduring the whips used by the players on each other’s hands as they tried to make other riders drop the goat carcass they were carrying towards the goal. Later, if a boy showed promise, he was given a horse and then two more. Each trip around the country of Afghanistan was fraught with peril of some sort. On our way back from Kundus, for example, we were trapped in a late May blizzard after crossing through the Salang Pass tunnel, the world’s longest and highest, built for the Afghans by the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The blizzard blew up so quickly that our taxi became totally covered with snow. When Rebecca got out of the car, she was immediately blown about 30 feet, perilously close to the edge of a cliff.

We survived this ordeal by taking turns walking in front of the cab, tethered by a rope so we wouldn’t fall off the cliff. I rented a house in Paghman, 2700 feet higher than Kabul’s 6000 ft. The first summer we used it to get out of the heat of the valley. I moved the horses up there and we began a pattern of going up in the late afternoon, enjoying a horseback ride and dinner in Paghman. The next morning, another horseback ride and afterward we’d return to the Kabul house. We always kept a couple of very gentle horses for guests to ride at Paghman, and one of those rides led us yet again into a life-or-death situation. Rebecca had made the acquaintance of a woman who was attached to the United Nations delegation in Afghanistan and claimed to be a good horsewoman. She was invited to join us on one of our rides. Unfortunately, due to her lack of skill, she had to walk the horse for about 45 minutes on the way back to the Paghman house. This got us back very late in the evening. We wanted to stay another night in Paghman before returning to Kabul, but the U.N. lady insisted she must get back for an event that was “pressing beyond compare.” I went to the tiny town square and, going outside my usual channels, found a car and driver to take us down the hill. At the bottom of the hill on the road from Paghman to Kabul, there is a no-man’s land for about 5 miles before you hit the outskirts of town. Suddenly there was some talk of gas or some car problem. The driver made a sharp right and bumped off the highway for a hundred yards or so, winding up in an encampment populated by what I can only describe as a band of nomads and desperadoes. I immediately heard him start to say, “They are rich and no one knows they are here,” which he repeated in a demonic voice and then said, “We can kill them and rob them.” We were forced to get out of the car and I was tackled by one of the group. We were fighting for our lives when Kachook came flying through the open backseat window and I heard the most fearsome snarl that I have ever heard coming from any animal.

It got everyone’s attention when he latched on the arm of the man nearest to where he landed, almost tearing it off. They backed off for a second. The driver screamed, “He’s just a puppy!” and they began to make their move again, when Kachook nailed another of the thieves by the leg, nearly breaking his ankle. This diversion allowed me to get my Bowie knife from its sheath. I grabbed Kachook by the collar while backing down toward the main highway with the women behind me. The murderers moved and started arguing with our driver – “You said he was just a puppy,” “He’s got a big knife,” “Nobody knows they’re here,” “Let’s circle around him,” “I don’t want that dog to bite me again, I’m bleeding.” It was a chaos of attempts to encircle us as we backed and backed and backed away some more with my big knife and snarling, foaming, big, bad puppy! The Gods sent us a blessing in the form of a big truck that had pulled off the road onto the little path the taxicab had taken when we exited the highway. The truck driver had the interior light on and appeared to be looking at a map. The next thing he knew he had two women, a guy with a big knife and a huge dog clambering into his cab, all yelling “Drive, drive!!” while Kachook snarled back at the would-be killers, who began pounding on the doors of the truck. Knowing his life might be in danger as well, the truck driver floored the gas pedal and we roared off to the relative safety of Kabul and our house.

Telephones were a luxury. Calls placed to the U.S. from Nepal, Afghanistan, India or anywhere in central Asia required a twenty-four hour advance booking. Calls were “routed up” one day and then you returned the next day hoping that the call could be completed and that the person you were calling was not on the phone! If you got a busy signal it was another twentyfour hour wait. We abandoned our hurried trip to the mainland and decided to stay in Maui to relax and decompress. Thus began our love affair with the Hawaiian Islands. We met a gentleman of Hawaiian/Chinese ancestry whose family owned a ranch surrounding the Seven Sacred Pools out near Hana. This chance meeting, which led to a conversation about horses, accompanied by a couple of pictures of me and mine in Afghanistan, eventually earned us an invitation to stay at their place, ride their horses and visit the Seven Sacred Pools. Naturally, we accepted their hospitality and had one great experience. The morning we arrived at the ranch to ride, we noticed a guy painting a sign at the entrance to the adjacent ranch. Tall and handsome and smiling at us through periwinkle blue eyes, Andrew Annenberg was beginning his work. He was the recipient of a Charles Lindbergh Scholarship, living in a cottage that had once been owned by the famed aviator and his wife, Ann. After the sensational kidnapping and trial of the 1930s, the Lindberghs retired to the Hana corner of Maui and built, in the New England tradition, an artist’s cottage on the property. Each year an artist was awarded a scholarship that included living in the cottage and a stipend. Andrew invited us to a party in Hana that night at the home of a local farrier, Cowboy Rick, and his wife, Pamela Jean. The gathering attracted a nice mix of folks who had grown up in the rainforest-like eco-system as well as several new-age émigrés.

Big Red Ted was back in the States from Nepal. He and Cathy had returned to the University of Wisconsin because Ted had a bout of hepatitis. As he recovered, he got a Masters degree in Tibetan studies and honed his Tibetan language skills. Cathy was creating a nice niche for her imaginative work in the U.S. They had built a gompa and a few other dwellings, but not much had really happened to help their plight and it was largely unknown to the rest of the world. Ted told me that Tashi Dorge, fueled with the few thousand dollars that I had brokered for him as payment for his family’s antique rugs, had started building apartments in Bodha, Kathmandu. About 20 Tibetan families were now housed in these dwellings. Skilled thanka painters and carpet weavers were attempting to recreate their artistry in Bodha. They brought with them whatever they could carry, along with stories of the horrible destruction of their monasteries and the murder of innocents. I was stunned, and my world rocked, when I discovered that Rebecca was not hale and hearty and ready to come back to the party. Instead, she informed me, she was leaving me and not returning to Asia. She’d had enough of “our” whole deal. Unexpectedly hit with this news, I took it as a challenge to my very manhood and dealt with it in a silent, angry and non-communicative manner. Even so, I loved her and wanted her back. I ended the conversation by saying, “at least take a couple of days and think it over.” A couple of days passed and then a couple more, and I didn’t hear from her. I felt sad and lonely.

Bill Wassman, who had just completed a year doing lighting for one of New York City’s most famous fashion photographers, took a black and white snapshot of us. “She’s more beautiful than any of those New York City models,” Bill said. This lovely, lithe garden of fantastic-looking flora had been fertilized with women’s liberation. In the past, we had met up here and there around the Bay Area. She invited me to her apartment and on the way I entertained her with a few tales about my life in Kathmandu, Amsterdam and Afghanistan. She listened while lighting up the first of many cigarettes and we started peeling the intellectual onion on a path toward the mother-of-pearl.

I discovered that she was a social worker and an educated woman. Once again I agreed to everything au courrant in the women’s liberation movement: Pregnancy leave? Good! … Stay at home mothers? Bad! Glass ceiling? Bad! Blanket political asylum for any woman who asks? Good! n the Tiamon Islands off the east coast of Malaysia there is a small private island known as Hujong-Folong, which translates from Malay as “the rainbow’s end”. The owner was a shipping executive stationed in Singapore. He developed the small island, 90 miles north of Singapore, as a weekend retreat for his wife and children. While we were attempting to secure passage out to the Tiamons we chanced to meet them on the pier in the cross-channel harbor town of Mersing. The family was leaving Malaysia for the season and offered us the sole use of the island.

A bamboo plumbing system delivered fresh water right to the house. There was even a generator for refrigeration. We were in a most delightful little paradise. There was only one caveat; two good-sized monitor lizards had the run of the beach at sunset. The creatures moved from the dry side of the island (where the house was) to the wet side for their nightly hunting. They had never been a problem, we were assured, in the 23 years the family had vacationed on the island. Each night at sunset, right on schedule, the huge lizards strolled down the beach. Chug, chug, chug – I’m soaking wet and bailing. Rebecca’s moaning. We spot a Chinese fish trap built into the middle of the sea. The Chinese leave people out there with only basic food just to tend the trap. A boat returns every three to four months. It may be one of the loneliest occupations on earth. Besides drowning, ending up clinging to one of those fish traps was my greatest fear. After four hours, we hit the harbor. “Good, good, you’re safe,” the harbor-master said to us. Rebecca and I kissed the earth. Monsoons in Southeast Asia mean rain, night and day, for about three months, and they were as big a morale-destroying factor for the American armies in Vietnam as anything else. It was an oppressive feeling, the thought of being trapped in constant rain. But we caught a break. A cabinet minister from Kuala Lumpur had been having a tête-à-tête with his mistress at our hotel. With nothing else to do and a command of English, he welcomed our company. The Minister made a phone call every hour on the hour. He barked in Malay and I couldn’t understand anything except one word and that word was “helicopter!” His demand for the helicopter became more strident with every phone call while my murmured encouragement became more emphatic. “Helicopter!” When one finally arrived, we were graciously offered a ride and unceremoniously deposited in the Malaysian Cameroon Highlands, at a tourist guesthouse.

There was probably five inches of the stuff in the first of the output containers we took outside to the front yard of the house. We smeared it on doobies and tried it in pipes. We celebrated. A late-night flight on an unpronounceable airline got me to the land of wooden shoes and coffee/smoke shops. This time, Bob and I were going to do the big one – trunks full of hash. Dutch Bob’s telegram said: “500 when you are ready to do it.” It was during this trip that I learned the why, and how, of the Hollanders’ knack of trading in spices for centuries. I arrived in Amsterdam airport to pick up the merchandise and was immediately escorted from the cargo area and down into the bowels of the Amsterdam airport by Dutch customs officials. After a short time, they explained to me how it was going to work. They gave me two Polaroid photos of the opened trunks in front of a sign that read “Dutch Customs Narcotics Enforcement.” Then they showed me a photo of a girl who had been on board a plane coming out of Asia with a small ball of hash in her boot. “She’ll be charged with your stuff, too. Do not feel too bad for her, because she was going to get three days detention for the contraband, anyway, and now she will get the same three days for the two trunks. The paperwork will say that when our diligent customs found the small ball, they then looked through her trunks. It’s just a matter of paperwork.” “As for you? You will be given some vouchers. They will entitle you to some fine dining at our best restaurants as well as a small suite overlooking the Signal Canal, both courtesy of the Royal Dutch Department of Tourism for this unfortunate mistake and delay when you entered the Netherlands. So, enjoy a few days vacation.” I was never sure exactly what happened.

Word had it that the Ambassador Hotel in Bombay had false-bottom suitcase makers in all sixty rooms. German Ted and Tory showed up at the Jangalak gate with Tory’s beautiful red horse with four white socks before my return from Amsterdam. Ted had recently bought it from a soonto-be transferred American diplomat. Tory said the diplomat claimed that the American television cowboy, Roy Rogers, had been in Afghanistan to shoot a Pamir sheep and tried to buy the horse from him. Rebecca told them I would be returning that day and she arranged for us to go horseback riding together, post-jet lag. From Jangalak to the mountains and across the Kabul River was the National Museum of Afghanistan. Coming back next to the river, the trail led to the National University of Afghanistan. The success of the carpet business, the employment of tailors and the fee and care required for four horses was a local industry unto itself. Even the goat brains and the entrails I boiled up daily to supplement Kachook’s diet came to be a relied-upon source of income for the local village compound. It was, as a result, safe for our women to make this ten-mile round-trip horseback ride. Abdul, in a sense, believed she was a doctor because she explained his wife’s menstrual cycle to him. Like the majority of Afghan men who paid a dowry to wed, Abdul was forced by custom to save his money until he was about forty years of age in order to buy a wife. This custom also meant that in general, the wives receiving the dowry were about twenty years of age, or younger. Abdul kept a photo of his wife in the kitchen and one day I asked how she was. This benign question lead to an emotionally sad story that she was “broken.” In his language, Farsi, I asked, “what’s wrong?” Abdul burst into tears and said, “Every month she bleeds,” and pointed. After a basic explanation to Abdul I indicated that I needed assistance and called in my wife. I translated, as Rebecca used a hand-made chart to explain “Basic Woman 101” to Abdul as well as our horseman and the old gateman’s married son. The commonality of this experience created the impression that Rebecca was a “doctor” in their eyes. Riding in safety through their villages was our reward.

Unfortunately, the day she decided to ride Sazz, Rebecca lost control of the horse. Fortunately, the desert trail that was accessible from our house was fairly restricted by the mountain base. Sazz galloped out of control into a nomad encampment. The horse tripped on a tent stake and Rebecca went flying, head over heels. She knocked herself out. The nomads and their women kindly helped her and calmed the skittish stallion. These compassionate people managed to get her and the horse back to our house. There was more bad news. That same night, Billy Batman took his German Mauser pistol out of its wooden case. The case, when screwed into the handle of the pistol, converted it to a rifle-like weapon. The gun slipped out of Batman’s hands, dropped to the floor, discharged and shot him in the testicles. The following day, the nomads who helped Rebecca came back to our house. We treated them as our honored guests, indebted as we were for their kindness to her and their respect for my horse. We staged an elaborate luncheon for them in the garden. The patriarch asked for a favor. They needed a gun. I spoke the Dari type of Farsi. The patriarch spoke the Ud dialect. The difference is like that between Elizabethan English I presented it to the head-man of the tribe with very little fanfare. They, in turn, professed their indebtedness to me. My gift of a gun was worth more than my wife’s life and my horse’s well being. His family now owed me big time. The two oldest sons of the nomad family were named Tashi and Kelli – this spelling is as close to phonetically correct as I can get. They seconded the deepest sense of gratitude that a simple, ancient culture could hold. Ted and Tory came the next afternoon for the previously planned horseback ride. They had accompanied Rebecca and me on many horseback rides up in Paghman village. They were respected by the locals in that remote mountain town as parents of a cute toddler and an economic asset. Plus, Ted and Tory’s home was on the fringe of the village, so we never had to ride through the commercial center or near the mosque. Two days after the great gun presentation to the nomads, Rebecca wanted to “get back on the horse.” Ted and Tory suggested we try a new route up to the ruins of Barbar’s garden.

None of us had ever ventured on this trail to the ancient, decayed baths and garden terraces built by Afghanistan’s famous king of yore. The gardens were located at the highest point of the Kabul Valley and, Tory said, “promised a spectacular, 360 degree view.” We passed through a crumbling arch into a small village before winding our way up to what was indeed a spectacular setting. King Barbar may have had his wives or daughters carried in sedan chairs to his opulent gardens, but the two women riding their own horses were probably a first. These two western women were cantering into a headwind blowing down from the Hindu Kush Mountains, in control of their own lives. On our return, we had no idea that a local imam had become outraged by reports of two women on horseback. As we passed his village, we were greeted by a gang of young toughs yelling “sacrilege” and charging after us with a hail of stones. No joyful shouts from youngsters of “doctor, doctor,” only “sacrilege!” and “prostitutes!” screamed at us in a killing frenzy. They tried to pull us off our horses and undoubtedly would have beaten us to death. Ted and I urged the women to flee and took on the men who ranged in age from late teens to early thirties. They attacked with sticks, bottles, and another barrage of stones. Initially, Ted and I were spared from harm because we were riding perfectly trained Buzkashi stallions. These great war horses of Genghis Khan short-charged and kicked on command. Bodies were flying. Ted and I reared our horses and went for our knives until we were sure our wives were safely out of there. Eventually, one man got hold of my leg and I was being pulled off my horse. Suddenly, my stallion reared at the sound of thunderous, echoing gun shots. The man let go of my leg and the mob froze as German Ted and I spurred toward safety, positive that the bullets were directed at us. As we turned for home, I caught sight of Kelli, the nomad, trotting towards the hill ridge. He had Batman’s smoking Mauser in his hand.

I gave Kelli a pair of sunglasses and an Uzbeki businessman’s hat for a disguise, then gave him one of our guest horses as not only a practical gift but to conform with local custom.

News of a French man and German woman whose rot-ting corpses were found on the edge of Kabul swept been forced to carry hundreds of stones to the roof of their Paghman home for protection after a loyal, local teenager, had warned them that a forced eviction was coming. After they spent twenty-four hours on their roof lobbing and ducking stones, the police chief himself showed up to escort them out of town. He kept their two horses as fair payment for saving Beth from being gang-raped. Beth told us, somewhat sarcastically, that Jittendra had thanked the chief, in Farsi, for his kindness. We no longer had our house in Paghman – not since the hash oil factory blew – yet I needed to slide through that danger zone, as it was the delivery point for the Waziri stallion. It took some doing to rent a Land Rover and a horse trailer. Ghiaz, Montreal Michael, The Sizzler and I prepared ourselves for anything and everything. We did have the over-and-under weapon with one shotgun shell. “Yak lak,” the price of the stallion, translated to “a hundred thousand Afghani” or $10, 000 US dollars, a price someone would kill your whole family for. That amount was considered the top dollar for any stallion. The Waziri was the coveted horse of choice by the most successful commercial businessmen.

Rebecca and I had been saved by Kachook on this same road. The night before we had heard the latest news that two brothers from Minnesota, walking around the world for peace, had been found murdered. “Walking the World for Peace” said the sign on their mule cart. The brothers were welcomed with great fanfare by the Minister of Tourism. International newspapers posted a photo of them posed before their “Walking for Peace” sign and noted their idealism. It wasn’t that the tribesmen were evil, nor was there anything inherent in the people of that part of the world that turned them into desperate robbers and thieves. It’s simply that a great percentage of the population was, at all times, near starvation. Thousands of souls were eking it out minute-tominute. The final days of winter meant people were down to their last turnip. There is not much in between “nothing” and “scarcity.” You might say it leads to a certain credo in that part of the world: “Homicide before Starvation.” It was not unusual to be met by a gaggle of teenage boys either curious or looking for a way to pick up a little money. And so, when three or four kids motioned us “this way” and offered to lead us to the storied horse, we followed. They took us to a high-walled corral at the far edge of Paghman village. The rugged trail followed a rocky, nearly dry creek. Michael had a difficult time with the Land Rover and trailer. He and Ghiaz began the demanding task of turning the car and trailer around in such narrow circumstances. Ghiaz and Michael managed to get the vehicles repositioned while the bargaining continued outside the enclosed corral. I agreed to go in and meet the man by myself, but I interjected one caveat – the money was going to be held by The Sizzler. I was not going in alone with all the money. The Sizzler couldn’t speak any Farsi so I explained to him that I was going in alone. He would hold the money at the Land Rover with Montreal Michael and Ghiaz.

The moment I saw the horse I was so thrilled that I let myself relax a little and concentrated on feeding him a couple of the carrots I’d brought for him. I barely had the treat out of my pocket and into my palm when half a dozen men with fighting sticks came out of the shadows and over the back wall. It was obviously an ambush and planned robbery. Whack! I was hit on the back with a stick before I could yell anything. Whack! “Give us the money and live!!” Whack! I ran for it, dodging, ducking and taking blows with no time to even pull my bowie knife from its sheath. The Sizzler came bursting through the door. A young boy with a stick was crouched trying to find a way to participate in the action. Instantly, the Sizzler had the stick out of his hand and the kid would be lucky to escape with broken arms and ribs as hard as Sizz hit him. Sizzler then delivered a ferocious blow to the thief preoccupied with me. It whacked off his ear and opened his skull, covering him with his own blood. I scrambled for position as Sizzler parried with a couple of assailants. I careened around a pillar in the corner where feed-bags were piled and heard someone gurgling as loud as he could for assistance. It was the horse dealer and he was on the ground, tied up and gagged. I dodged another fierce blow as I realized that these guys were planning on murder, not just robbery. while I limped along behind the trailer for as long as I could manage. I wanted to be seen by as many of the villagers as possible, so no claim could be made against us alleging we had stolen the horse and inflicted the mayhem. If the police chief showed up we were going to “kick his ass” and keep moving. I spent three days in bed, my body totally black and blue from the beating I took, but I had the horse and Rebecca was a most loving and sympathetic nurse. It was a couple of weeks later that I received a letter from that “hot-house flower” back in San Francisco announcing, in a casual way, “I am going to have your baby in a few months.” In essence, the letter said there was no doubt about the bloodline.

These vehicles could accommodate about eighteen hearty souls who were trying to make it to the increasingly popular “Nirvana of the East” on the same shoe-string-budget guide book. After going through the drug law dichotomy of Turkey, it being that hashish was readily available and used openly, but, if you were caught with some, you paid dearly in Turkey’s infamous, draconian manner, there was paranoia at every border crossing, even if you didn’t have any drugs. Some of those hassled, half-starved road heroes found their way into the oasis that was the Sina Hotel outside of Kabul. A guy named Sakhi worked out of this hotel. He was very well connected and he sold bits of the wonderful Sharikh hash from Balkh to those travelers who passed through the hotel. Sakhi was from the Balkh area where the golden, hand-pressed hash originated. It was, as far as I was concerned, the finest that Afghanistan had to offer. He had married an attractive woman from Wales who never appeared in anything but the finest Turkoman-style clothes and jewelry. How and where they met was always a subject of discussion. Sakhi never shared a hint about that or anything, especially his sources and methods of dealing with the warlords of the North. While she didn’t wear a scarf, Sakhi’s wife was more than demure when she served her husband’s guests tea. German Ted and I were sitting in the garden negotiating with Sakhi to make a run up north to purchase a bit of hash for ourselves. German Ted had it going to Europe successfully as well. He created disks of the Sharikh hashish and put a light coating on them. Tory painted stunningly beautiful pictures of various Buddhist deities on the disks and they were, well … sailing through customs. Tory had taken refuge in Buddhism during her pregnancy. Ted was rolling one of those three-paper European joints that included tobacco and a filter. While I was never particularly fond of mixing tobacco with hash, it always made for a more pleasant negotiation.

As part of the deal, Sakhi was also demanding that Tory paint an image of a mullah on one of the hash disks. The garden of the Sina Hotel had high, adobe walls and beautiful trees shading comfortable chaise lounges. Above us we could hear the ruckus of arrival coming from rooms full of the new, weary guests. Sakhi, Ted and I were enjoying strawberries and cream with wonderful tea when into the garden walked an obviously Nordic beauty. She was a statuesque blonde classic in her early twenties wearing a blue Turkish rampa shirt, long Moroccan fleecelined suede coat, tight blue silk slacks tucked into Spanish boots. Her gorgeous face glowed under a blue beret. Danish Mona’s arrival was not only the end of our hash negotiations with Sakhi, it was the beginning of the end of everything that German Ted had going for him, including his pretty, intelligent wife who loved him enough to help him smuggle hashish, who gave him a beautiful baby girl and was willing to live in some of the wildest and most dangerous places on earth just to be by his side. It was all, as of this moment, finito – over and done. Ted rented a room at the Sina and began his non-stop pursuit of Mona. Tory eventually took baby Guava and left for Kathmandu. Ted had already convinced an obviously pregnant Aggie to carry suitcases with concealed hash to Amsterdam. Ted’s romantic pursuit prevailed and it wasn’t long before Mona was included in this plan. Aggie’s big stomach, and the fact that eight of them were making the trip, was the strategy the principals embraced. I didn’t have much faith in these operations. The suitcases were built with false bottoms. The linings were glued back on, often in a very shoddy manner, plus customs officials in other countries once in a while caught someone en-route. Fortunately, Aggie and Mona were successful and returned to Kabul with Ted’s share of the money. Unfortunately for him, Mona’s mother arrived with them. Momma accompanied her daughter to Kabul with one thing in mind: no German Ted was going to make money off of her daughter by having her carry suitcases filled with hashish to Europe.

Within a year’s time, Mona and Momma accomplished quite a few successful runs back and forth to Amsterdam. We all welcomed them on their returns to Kabul and happily received their gifts of European culinary delights. I once suggested to them that Mona could end up in jail somehow, but Momma assured me that “no male Dutch customs agent on earth would want to do anything except have sex with Mona, period!” Momma added, emphatically, “I watch and they are always on their best behavior when Mona passes through.” At our home in Jangalak, Abdul cooked dinner for tenevery night. Guests who attended were ardent converalive with entertainment and merriment. Some played local instruments, others acoustic guitars. Our home became an everchanging showplace for the treasures we would buy and sell. Rebecca was a walking manikin, resplendent in the clothes and jewelry she found in the bazaar or had sewn by our tailors. I ran to the second floor window and saw boys with red scarves around their necks coming over the walls of our compound. Through the twilight, I could see someone in an Afghan officer’s uniform, also wearing a red scarf around his neck. He was berating the gateman. It was about 100 yards from the house to the giant castle-like gates that secured our estate. Abdul went down to the front stairs to find out what was up. The gates were thrown open and two more military uniforms and another half dozen red-scarfed youths rushed through. “Passports, passports,” the officer kept shouting. In fluent Farsi, I yelled, “What’s the problem?” The military men explained to me that there was a new government in Kabul and a new day for Afghanistan and that he wanted our passports. Now assembled in the compound were a dozen or so young “cadre” members carrying machetes or fighting-sticks. The gateman was screaming and crying. Abdul charged out of the house, waving his arms and injecting obscenities into his warning that the property owner was the Deputy Prime Minister. As he spat out the gory details of all the bad things that were going to happen to them for this disturbance, my loyal horseman, Asmir, shouted and yelled for them to get away from his quarters next to the horse barn.

They started threatening back. The young officer ordered half a dozen of his thugs to attack Abdul. They violently dragged him down. By then, Rebecca and the guests at the party had found their way to windows and the edge of the balcony. The thugs pulled Abdul down on the ground. One of them dove at him and slowly, right before our eyes, gnawed off his little finger and handed it to the officer. The officer held up the bloody stump, looked me in the eye and said, “I want the passports – NOW!” I, of course, told him “yes.” And that was it; the rush was on. We were given 72 hours to get out of the country, and our exodus from Afghanistan began. Once again lives were twisted with weapons, threats and violence in the name of politics. What had happened was a coup that overthrew the King of Afghanistan. The King’s cousin, Daoud, ascended to the post of prime minister and abolished the monarchy. Daoud was a long-time symbol of Afghani democracy. He had been prime minister during a period when the country had flirted with a constitutional monarchy. Daoud expressed his democratic views once too often, though, and his cousin threw him in jail. He continued to be popular with students; the guys in the red bandannas were young, political democrats. Obviously, Daoud was the choice of some factions in the Afghan military. The military officer holding Abdul’s bloody finger above his head, barking orders, was the most recent symbol of the ever-changing quicksand of Asian politics. After the melee, Rebecca tended to the wounded Abdul and the first thing I had to do was find the right homes for our horses. Ghiaz, who had been the deciding factor during the attempted horse robbery was, like all Afghans, an expert horseman and kindly helped me place my horses into the best existing herds. I had to get an airplane-worthy crate built to ship Kachook back with us. Sakhi and his wife took our beloved cat, Sammy. Great sadness prevailed during those final hours with the staff. They faced an uncertain future after finding, with us, a modicum of stability in their lives. We packed the Afghan carpets, tapestries and one-of-a-kind treasures and got everything shipped to the States; what we didn’t ship, we carried with us.

Kachook left Afghanistan with Rebecca’s brother, Evan, who happened to be visiting us at the time of the coup. Our dog had no papers other than a certificate for his rabies shot from The Royal Afghan Veterinary clinic. Both dog and brother managed to make the journey to the U.S.A. intact, although Kachook and Evan spent two nights in the London airport, quarantined, until someone got tired of it all. Kachook was a big dog, loved his food and the airport offered many inspiring places to relieve himself. Evan was allowed to take Kachook out for walks but he was not allowed to leave the grounds, so what’s a dog to do? Eventually the customs officials declared that they were America’s problem and sent them on to New York. When Evan and Kachook got to New York City, word of the coup in Afghanistan had reached customs. The customs agent, amazingly, just let Evan and the dog go through. Eventually there weren’t enough planes. The foreigners were in mass flight, via Herat into unpleasant Iran or chancing the Khyber Pass. Rebecca and I, like Alexander the Great before us, were officially and unceremoniously kicked out of Jangalak and joined the exodus. William VIII and Aggie were the only exceptions because Aggie was ready to deliver their son. He was the first foreigner born in a monarch-less Afghanistan. Rebecca and I planned to return to the States in the opposite direction as her brother and Kachook, after we made a business stop in Thailand. We were heading toward California and San Francisco, starting out by going overland through the Khyber Pass and spending a night in Jalalabad, a city on the old southern crossing route. Jalalabad was edgy, noisy, and sounds of scattered violence kept us awake all night long. We managed to reach the other side of the Khyber Pass in a 1953 Chevrolet station wagon that we paid a Pakistani driver a fortune to drive for us. The car was listing hard right because the shock absorbers were nonexistent and we had loaded the car with everything we could carry. A small, railroad-crossing type gate was all that marked the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. The horizon offered desert and dunes as the chugging chore for our vehicle.

Through the swirling dusk came a Pakistani officer sporting a full handlebar moustache, jodhpurs, pistol on his hip and his riding crop in hand. At full attention, he announced “Pakistani Mobile Anti-Smuggling Patrol” in perfect English. When we finally arrived in San Francisco, I purchaseda converted school bus known as the “Oakie Driftable perfection by its previous owner, and was large enough to carry everything we managed to get out of Kabul. We located Rebecca’s brother Evan and enjoyed a cheerful reunion with him and Kachook. Rebecca, Kachook and I then headed out to buy some water; more specifically, land with water on it. A small pond, a bend in a river or a swimmin’ hole. We went to Oregon and Washington before finding a blessed piece of the planet in the foothills of Northern California. William VIII and Aggie took their newborn baby and headed to the Swat Valley in the tribal area of Northwestern Pakistan. Only a few hard travelin’ types made it to Swat. Tribal territories were known to be even more dangerous than Afghanistan. The Wali of Swat was only slightly beholden to the political structure of Pakistan. Pakistani federal power meant paperwork, rubber stamps and fees that were necessary to stay more than three days. William VIII rented a decent house, hired a servant and went to Peshawar to get the visa for his family. He was found dead in his hotel room. After a series of murders along the hashish trail were tied to Charles Gurmukh Sobhraj, we all rethought the young and healthy 25-year-old William VIII’s “heart attack.” Sobhraj’s modus operandi was to befriend fellow travelers before killing and robbing them of their passports and travelers checks. His road of death spanned from France to Kathmandu. He killed three people in Swayambunath shortly after arriving in Nepal. He poisoned many of his victims after meeting them around the hotel or travelers’ restaurants. William VIII’s sad demise seemed similar and coincided with Sobhraj’s known travel timeline. Everything William VIII owned was gone, but that was attributed to thieving, corpserobbing hotel employees. Everything about the nature of his death was troubling, and forever unresolved.

A horseback riding girlfriend of Rebecca’s, Penny Nichols, was renting one of the last livable ramshackle cabins on the spa grounds while stabling her two horses in a converted garage. After driving the Oakie Drifter night and day for a couple of months, I was ready to soak. An old, local cowboy asked me if I wished to take a ride with him up the canyon while he scouted stray cattle. He said I’d see a 200-year-old Spanish-made stacked stone corral that was still used during spring branding. Once out of the flatland silt, the creek we were following to the foothills became crystal clear. Two hours ride past the stone corral I spotted a handlettered sign tacked to a fence post planted on a fire-break that read “ranch for sale.” I called out to the old cowboy, “What kind of ranch is it?” It was known as Dirty Creek, which was a misnomer up where we were. The creek had been named by folks down in the flatlands, where it flowed after picking up a lot of silt in the foothills. That was a very big break. Imagine you’re driving down Interstate 5 in your huge RV with a slew of kids and you want to go camping. Would you choose Rock Creek, Deer Creek, Pine Creek, Crystal Creek or … Dirty Creek? first learned to fly at Gnoss Field, one of the most difficult small plane airstrips to land on in California. It is surround-I ed by swamp and wetlands on three sides and a freeway on the other. A fierce crosswind blows off the ocean with increasing strength almost every afternoon. I chose to get my wings there on the surmise that most other airstrips would be relatively easy. I was planning on landing in the middle of the Mojave Desert after a little jump up from Mexico anyway. I quickly learned to fly the plane and work the radio, but my navigational skills were shaky at best. I soloed in a Cessna model 172 on January 7, 1970, and I flew every day thereafter for a week. For a season, I parlayed my limited skills into a gig as a “Johnny Potseed” pilot, flying short hops around the Emerald Triangle.

I met Skipper Gary on the Sausalito waterfront when he was ferrying supplies to the Native Americans occupying Alcatraz Island. Currently, he had been hired as a master woodworker on rock music star David Crosby’s sailboat, the “Maya.” Crosby had a home in nearby Mill Valley. I had great admiration for him because of his activist efforts in the anti-Vietnam War movement. He once hid in the trunk of a car for fifty dangerous miles through a violent, right-wing gauntlet to perform at an Austin, Texas, war protest. Eschewing the Hollywood lifestyle after being fired from The Byrds, he had formed the super-group Crosby Stills & Nash. The Trident was the hotbed hangout of marijuana smugglers, dealers and rock stars. The waitresses at the Trident were allowed to wear whatever they wanted, rather than some sort of pink fluffy uniform or bunny outfit, which was in vogue at that time. Crosby, Skipper Gary and I ordered food outside on the deck of the restaurant. Seated at the table next to us were four black men. It was Miles Davis, with two older gentlemen and one young man in his late teens. Crosby stood up and gushed, “You’re Miles Davis, man. You’re my hero and the most incredible musician going today.” He was sincere and his words were heartfelt. At that moment I began to truly like David Crosby, for his genuineness and openness. Miles looked over at David, dropped his sunglasses down his nose, peered over them and didn’t say a word. The two older men frowned and oozed disdain. It was as if the three of them were directing little sparks and bad vibes at Crosby. Nonetheless, he stammered on, talking about particular pieces of Davis’ music and how brilliant it was, as well as throwing in the fact that they had appeared on the same stage in New York City once. Miles still didn’t say a word. Suddenly, the young black teenager sitting with the three said to them, “You guys don’t know who this is … this is David Crosby … he’s got hits.” Then to David he said, “Don’t pay no attention to these guys, man. These old men, they don’t know nothin’ about your band.” He pointed adamantly at us and said to his three companions, “These guys don’t know race! They’re hippies! They love everyone, man.

Our idea was to fly, Alaska bush-pilot style, to a small airstrip where they picked you up in a scale-model steam train and whisked you off to a posh restaurant named the Nut Tree, exactly fortyfive miles equidistant from Sacramento and San Francisco. It was allegedly created so the power brokers could meet halfway between the State Capitol and the Bay Area to arrange those “side” deals that had to be discussed mouth-to-ear only. Adding the airstrip (the shortest in California) cut the bigwigs’ travel time to the restaurant’s expansive grounds. I knew how to fly a small plane but did not have a license or much in the way of navigator skills. A new friend who owned the puddlejumper rented it to me under the false assumption that I actually had a pilot’s license. Our romantic 100-mile hops down to the Nut Tree ended when a small plane crashed on the restaurant’s tiny airstrip while Rebecca and I were dining. In attempting to find out what happened I asked an official on the scene, who said, “Minor case of wind shear … happens out here on the prairie regularly” and then added succinctly: “People either know how to fly or they sorta’ know how to fly.” A love of flapping canvas and the whistling wind was born in me that day. I gave up flying noisy, motorized aircraft and switched to gliders. The money-making opportunities a glider offered were practically nil, but weighed against silent soaring, eye-to-eye with red-tailed hawks, it was worth a king’s ransom. The second type was a unique style that came from a region on the outskirts of Lhasa called “Walloon.” This style evolved in the 1950s. It was sort of the “shag carpet” for middle-class Tibetans, with colorful dyes and wild non-traditional designs. The Walloons are best described as a clan living in accordance with the Buddhist philosophy. They had relocated from Tibet to a remote corner of the accessible pass between Bhutan and Nepal when the Dalai Lama fled into exile. The third type of carpet I specialized in was the Tibetan Tiger design. Meditating on Tiger carpets is said to give the power of the tiger to the meditator. Over the centuries, the Tiger carpet evolved into many representations of the animal. Tibet had no tigers, thus they were depicted at various times in history as elaborate, colorful profiles, splayed pelts or even a bare-bones skeleton with a head and whiskers.

President Richard Nixon offered the King of Nepal $200 million to build a sewer system for the capital city of Kathmandu. The string that was attached to this bribe was that the Kingdom of Nepal would become the last country in the world to finally criminalize ganja. No less than the soon-to-be disgraced Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, while in Nepal to negotiate the deal, had actually stopped his entourage at the Inn Eden in Kathmandu. Its small sign, an open advertisement for hashish sales, caught the vice president’s attention. All this bravado, just so he could point out to his Nepalese diplomatic hosts the unacceptability of this little shop. Agnew berated his host about this and, combined with the $200 million bribe, got Nepal on board. A country that previously had no heroin junkies or opium dens would soon become overrun with them. In Nepal, hashish use was an integral part of religious ceremonies. For 1500 years it had been part of the culture and was embedded in acceptable society. Hash offered no beacon to criminals and thugs. Making it illegal created a new, much more lethal market for hashish and other outlawed substances; the days of relaxed smoking and social highs were gone forever. That $200 million was nothing but seed money for criminal enterprises. Within a year, in order to add credence to the necessity of the new Drug War, a nasty rumor was spread. The rumor was that Henry Kissinger himself, using American Express traveler’s checks, had bought two kilos of pure heroin in Durbar Square in downtown Kathmandu. Anyone who was there at the time knew this was utter nonsense. Simultaneously, the Tibetan carpet bonanza was on. As the carpets sold, the Tibetans purchased Levi jeans and jackets, cassette players, and Honda 90 motorcycles zipped around everywhere. The brick factories worked night and day to supply the Bodha apartments being constructed. Fifty meters from Ted and Cathy’s gate, above the Bodnath stupa, a small, 500-year-old dharamsala encircled a beautiful old shade tree. It became the location of a “financial futures” market based on carpet sales. I enjoyed Ted’s descriptive letters detailing how it blossomed into a full-blown mini-Wall Street exchange, based on the international money-grams that I sent periodically.

Off-the-wall schemes and the aptly named “pipe dreams” usually ended disastrously with time in jail for the wouldbe smuggler. Rebecca accused me of making it look too easy. One such scheme sent thirteen women, each carrying two false-bottom suitcases, simultaneously out of the same travel agency in Kathmandu to Australia. The brilliant part of this scheme was that the runners would go via Nairobi, where they would all claim to have had their passports stolen by their “missing” tour leader. The idea was that, armed with new passports issued in Kenya, they and their suitcases would slip easily into Australia. Of course, they were all arrested as soon as they got there. Another crazy scheme involved building hash-carrying cages for two Lesser Pandas. The rare creatures immediately attracted the attention of customs officials. Tibetan mastiff puppies were shipped in similar hash-concealing cages and eventually snatched by customs authorities in the United States. It made for colorful journalistic reporting in the International Herald Tribune. The tyrannical, old-line enforcement apparatus employed these bizarre tales as propaganda to bash all the countries of Asia into “quota” arrests. hose of my circle who were old enough in 1964 voted for Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the “Peace Candidate.” The Peace Candidate. If we would have known his later publicized recipe for political success: “Accuse your opponent of f^( * * * *) ing pigs then watch him deny it,” we may have made another choice. When Big Red Ted finished his studies at the University of Wisconsin, he and Cathy returned to Nepal and found a fantastic home in Bodha. It was an old Rana palace built high on a knoll above the Bodha Stupa. It was similar to our Jangalak place, being located on a couple of acres behind surrounding high walls. Soon a dozen Nepalese and Tibetans were employed full-time at the house and it became a force in the local economy. Ted and Cathy had two Lhasa Apso pups from a bloodline originating in Tibet. Ted had a little corner plot in the garden that he tended himself, which yielded what he called “Bodha Blue.” It was grown with seeds from my developing purple strain at the ranch, but the high Himalayan light gave it a bluish hue.

Even the taciturn Bill Wassman was in high spirits as we all celebrated at the Chong Shop when, as the new President Gerald Ford said “the long American nightmare is over.” It was during one of my frequent trips to Nepal that Bill Wassman showed up in Kathmandu, much to the relief of his wife Patty. He was on assignment in New York City and made a brief stop in one of his old haunts in Ibiza before heading back to Asia. The next morning we rode the horses up to Zena’s monastery on Karpon Hill where we were always offered tea by Lama Yeshe and Zopa. An easy glimpse into each of these four friends would be to describe their sense of humor. Big Red Ted could find humor in almost anything and enjoyed provoking an even funnier response and joining in the laughter. His wife, Cathy, had a hearty, genuinely feminine bellow. Patty Wassman always giggled into her shoulder. A funny anecdote from her was witty and well told. Bill was a compassionate ironist. He chuckled progressively louder and longer as his audience “got” the pathos and tragedy that almost always oozed from him. Rebecca was a sincere audience, who rarely spoke, but almost always kept the dialogue going with comic insight. Her eyes would sparkle. This time our adventure would be a lot more comfortable and much healthier, food-wise, than relying on the local harvest. We had a memorable venture to the ice caves of the Annapurna Sanctuary. Rebecca handled it like a deer caught in the headlights. But it was so exhilarating for me that I went out on the Everest trek after a week’s rest. Ted understood and since he loved trekking so much, decided to make it his living. Besides Everest, another popular choice with many spectacular and exhilarating views as well as culturally interesting village life and monasteries on the way up and down is the Annapurna Sanctuary. Three peaks named Annapurna I, II and III as well as a mountain known as Machapuchare form this part of the range, and many experienced mountaineers call these peaks the most beautiful in the world. As you walk your body gets stronger and acclimated. The mind has time to dwell on the beauty of nature and you meet wonderful local people (often the legendary high altitude dwellers, the Sherpas.) You admire their toughness, strength and cheerful friendliness. Ancient monasteries clinging to rock buttresses appear.

The monks are smiling, spiritual and happy to offer a blessing or provide a bit of shelter or tea. Patty left Bill Wassman. It was a minor miracle of the ages that she hadn’t left him sooner. Bill had become one of the world’s greatest travel photographers because he was willing to take a treacherous bus ride up any mountain in Asia, live in the backwater of an unheard-of island in the Philippines, or risk a voyage in a narrow, canoe-like river craft up the Irrawaddy, in Burma. “Anytime, anyplace, anywhere” said Bill. He was willing to eat lizards, roots, snakes or whatever was available, wherever in the world he went. Bill never cared much about food. He cared about the photo. He was true to Socrates in the short form: “Eat to Live!” For Patty, the waterlogged, rusting hulks that served as inter-island ferries, or chugging diesel buses that broke down in the middle of nowhere, were no longer exotic, interesting or romantic. I would remind everyone that when we were roommates post-college, Bill would cook up a mess of tripe, potatoes, carrots and cabbage in a big pot, simmer the concoction for about twelve hours, and eat it for three meals a day, five days in a row. It was as if he was preparing himself, then, for the life he would lead in Asia, a life that brought us the beautiful photographs of those remote realms. He captured time and place, mood and space. Bill’s work in photography was similar in feeling to the paintings of Andrew Annenberg on Maui (we cherished the photos Andrew sent us after an arduous year painting singlehair brush style). By the next year, Nepal was rapidly becoming a different place from that which we had experienced earlier in the decade. Hippies had originally come to Nepal hitchhiking overland and by train and bus out of Europe on journeys that were not unlike pilgrimages. Traveling slowly out of the modern life of Western civilization and into the ancient world of Asia somehow acclimated the traveler. Western focus turned to Eastern philosophy and our understanding of local customs and traditions dawned, for most of us, by simply taking our time and “going with the flow.” This acclimation included a trade-off for modern life’s stresses and values. It took all our energy to handle the stress of everyday life traveling in Asia.

After Patty left, Bill spent many a night at the Chong Shop in Bodha. Chong is a Tibetan beer and it was brewed right on the premises. Big barrels of fermenting barley and millet lined the tiny pathway through the slop to an open courtyard and primitive benches. Three stories of bricks housed many, many people living above the seething, rancid brewery. Sitting in the brewery courtyard, while getting thoroughly inebriated, Bill and the other nightly denizens enjoyed a view of the mountains and the terraced rice fields below. Bill held court nightly, post-Patty, in a bitter state of mind. He enlightened many an adventuresome tourist on the evils of Chairman Mao who, he said, used Tibetans as slaves in the deadly dangerous jobs building his huge dam projects, along with the dark side of the Nepalese monarchy, the evils of the British Royal Family, McNamara, Kissinger, and why Jimi Hendrix was a wanker on guitar. ean the Dream showed up in Nepal and told us a harrowing tale. There was a little ice cream and coffee shop on the second floor of a building just off Connaught Circus in New Delhi. For many, many years, Indian intellectuals and artists had mingled on the veranda enjoying the sweets and sharing the sacred herb. It was an easy place for Indira Gandhi’s ever more militant and escalating state bureaucracy in India to target. On his way back to Kathmandu via a redeye, cheapo plane ticket, Bill Wassman found himself on the veranda with Dean the Dream and a few other road warriors and their female companions. In a “round up the usual suspects” operation, one high-profile Indian artist, one European couple and Bill, representing America, were picked out of the crowd and arrested as arbitrary choices. Dean was somehow overlooked. It cost Bill nearly a month in the squalor of Tihar prison and then deportation to the States. It almost cost Dean the Dream his life.

Dean was staying at the Imperial Hotel, an eminent road traveler’s haven and a comfortable choice for the seasoned Asia veteran. He was afraid to return to his room because he thought the ice cream and coffee shop was such an obvious choice for the raid that this “flying drug squad” might swoop in on another prime location such as the Imperial. With just the cash he had on hand for the night, he checked into a sleazy Delhi hotel that had cubicles for rooms and a bathroom for thirty down the hall. Unable to sleep because of the noise in the ceilingless room that also allowed the muggy, filthy air of New Delhi to seep into his cubicle, Dean the Dream almost ended up in the murderous clutches of Charles Sobhraj, who happened to be wandering about near his hotel at 3:00 A.M., an hour that is always dangerous in the third world. Dean met what appeared to be a typical European couple. They claimed that Indian Airlines had lost their luggage, forcing them to try to find cheap accommodations in the middle of the night. They were both drinking from a bottle of Fanta soda and speaking in French-accented crude English. Pointing across the street, Dean the Dream told them what a horror show his own hotel was, and if they could afford anything else to find it. The European couple suggested they all go up to Dean’s hotel anyway, since it was so close, and enjoy some blonde Lebanese hash that the girl had smuggled inside her body and that she was very anxious to remove. Whether out of loneliness, boredom, or the curiosity of a man living his life on the road, Dean invited them up to his hotel. Within minutes of the three of them settling into Dean’s cubicle, in an unguarded moment, the European man hit Dean over the head with his empty Fanta bottle. Fortunately for Dean, the door to his accommodation was paper thin. The blow caused him to fall backwards, through the door, and he landed flat on his back in the middle of the hallway. It was now about 4:00 A.M., and fortunately for Dean, a “john” was arguing over the agreed-upon price with a lady of the night only two doors down. Leaving his argument for a moment, he approached the scene of the commotion. Sobhraj and his evil, female consort then dashed down the stairs and were gone.

Dean the Dream arrived in Kathmandu with tales of his misadventures in Delhi and warnings of what he felt could be a serial criminal on the hashish trail. Dean was suspicious because of the way the guy had invoked the Lebanese blonde to entice him up to the room. Sharing one form of cannabis or another was a sacramental ritual on the trail and unsuspecting travelers could easily be lured in this way. It was a few short months later, when pictures of Sobhraj in his many disguises started showing up in the international media, that Dean the Dream was able to confirm he was almost victim twenty-four in the “official” count. he owner of the property we bought in California was the first Federal Forest Ranger, appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. His territory ranged from the Napa Valley to the Oregon border. “There are 10,000 paper pushers in my old territory now,” he would often tell me. While surveying the land for the Forest Service he had discovered the waterfalls and bought the land. Once he did, using federal bulldozers, he cut a firebreak out to a perfect home-site. He re tired there in 1963 after 30 years of duty in the Forest Service. Centuries before, Mt. Lassen had been an active volcano and Dirty Creek, cutting through the lava, had formed a wonderful grotto. Developing the place into an organic paradise became a labor of love. Skipper Gary built an authentic sauna that allowed one to toast at 190 degrees and then leap into the cool, clear creek. We improved the existing garden by creating bio-dynamic, raised beds. The orchard was expanded with additional fruit and nut trees. We built a first-class, four-box stall horse barn. Sure-footed Appaloosas, perfect for the rough terrain, were the horse of choice. Tent Tom created a unique Tibetan tent for the garden. Along with the Tibetan snow leopards and lotus flowers, the tent must have had appliqués of fertility symbols because, over time, earth mothers conceived within those canvas walls. A couple of guys talked me into growing marijuana commercially. I agreed to their proposal for the botanical knowledge, and because I wanted to see and enjoy the results produced by my collection of imported seeds. High-end imported grass was valued at four times the price of “California Homegrown.” Homegrown was considered second-rate to the plants cultivated on the slopes of the Andes, the jungles of Jamaica or the verdant highlands of Thailand.

Our slogan was: “With good seeds, nine months of care and careful cultivation under full sun, plenty of water, and organically enriched soil, even an idiot can come up with something just as tasty.” Our crop had the advantage of enjoying a true southern-exposed slope into which the bio-dynamic beds were carved. Every bit of soil was sifted through screens to remove even the smallest pebble and mixed with manure and free-range chicken poop to create a fluffy plot. The hard part was being scratched by the manzanita, eaten by the mosquitoes, and caked with mud spatter while tending the plants. At harvest time, my two partners said, “This stuff is so good we’re going to get twice as much money as any homegrown!” The mother of invention can also be inspired by unrelenting mosquito bites. Thus my idea: include one T-shirt with each ounce sold at a price equal to that of the imported weed. The first T-shirt was a very direct sales pitch. It was emblazoned with the word “Sensamillia” [sic] written across the front and “Sweet, Virgin, Spicy” underneath an image of a beautiful young girl with stars in her eyes, rainbows around her head and bud spilling out of the basket she was carrying. At first the market said, “It’s too much for homegrown, but if I get one of those T-shirts I’ll take it this time!” Homegrown became a growth industry for the impoverished lumber community. People showed up like the Fortyniners who had originally settled this part of California, and started growing. I watched them buying land, living in a tent, growing weed and building a cabin. Then after another growing season, putting in a water system and toilet. Another successful year, and they were building a barn and sauna and getting a new truck. In between there’d often be a baby or two. The nearby town benefited as well. A Little League field was built, equipment was upgraded for the local volunteer fire department and a little fairground was cleared for an annual summer festival. It was truly a golden time for back-tothe-earth folks desiring a green lifestyle. Anywhere from six to thirty-six people hung out in the swimming holes at any given time.

This beautiful bitch became Kachook’s mate and they had two litters A deputy sheriff had policed this area for more than thirty years. His main problems were stolen-car choppers. The thieves would bring a car up into the dense woods, strip it and leave the remains. If they got away with it once, they came back up a second time. He also had to deal with deer poachers who were incredibly dangerous. Most of them were abjectly poor folks, often from other Northern California counties, who had been arrested numerous times for poaching deer and were facing serious jail time for repeated offenses. They were armed to the teeth and ready to draw down. Everyone in the area respected the deputy for working solo and taking on these desperadoes. The deputy stopped by the ranch once in awhile for coffee. He, like most people, was fond of Rebecca and would often say to me, “To protect your wife from one of these low-lifes, if anyone comes up here and gives you any trouble, just hit ‘em right through the windshield and call me. I’ll take care of it from there.” A nother winter approached and Rebecca and I went back to Nepal. Our itinerary included a slow, steady, pace with studious, serious field trips, at times picking up a treasure or two here and there. We were wending our way through the haze of clove cigarettes in Java, the pools of red betel-nut spit on the sidewalks of India and Indonesia, or the stench from cigars constantly smoked by both sexes in Northern Thailand; then finally over to Kathmandu to oversee the expanding Tibetan carpet business. Wassman and I rode Russian motorcycles. They were a perfect superficial copy of the great American-made Triumph Bonneville, with big, fancy gas tanks. They never started on the first kick and could just reach the speed limit, but, as Bill said, “It was a very sexy-looking machine.” Wassman would putt-putt around with a Dharma-ite up behind him. “Dharmaites” were what we called the girls who had come to the East to absorb some Buddhism. Bill told the Dharma-ites that his wife had left him after tiring of being forced to survive like the poorest Sadhu in southern India.

Fortunately, the maniac had drunk himself into a stupor, and they escaped at three or four in the morning. When Bill flagged down a car outside the villa and the driver offered to take them to the next town, Bill refused because the price was too high. Luckily, they survived, but this was the last straw for Patty. Things seemed to have come full circle, as many of these new arrivals were wearing the silk harem pants that Rebecca and I had produced in Asia and sent to Frankfurt. “Dharmaites, wearing clothes made of silk brocade from China, tailored in Afghanistan and sold in Europe, are riding on the back seat of a Russian motorcycle driven by an obsessed American in Nepal,” quipped Cathy about her friend Bill. “It’s a small world.” Tantric sex was also in the gestalt of the new female Dharma-ites. Bill had experimented with Tantra during his marriage and easily became comfortable as an appreciative mentor. Tantric sex requires discipline and practice – Rebecca and I found it enjoyable, if rather taxing, preferring a more spontaneous, romantic approach. The Tibetan mafia was not a violent or criminal organization in the Western sense. They had the power to control dyes and export quotas. The mafia kept the “nouveau riche” Tibetans in line through gambling and drinking. Each major holiday found more and more workers enslaved, in debt for their future wages because of drunken gambling losses. The mafia could not affect my business directly because I used Yak wool and natural dyes. Nor could they control my little “designer niche” Walloon carpets because they came in from Bhutan, where the Walloon clan was thriving in that sanctuary. As for the Tibetan Tiger carpets, the energetic Thamal traders were only too happy to search them out and pay top dollar. But my Nepalese customs broker and shipping company could be intimidated. They would shrug and say they could not ship on the day promised, or even ship at all! At the same time, the temple thieves and museum rip-offs were doing very nicely, thank you.

The former Hog Farmer was well entrenched in the Kathmandu Valley, and, like everyone else who wanted to stay there, was trying to market Tibetan carpets, find an antique to sell, or smuggle hash. In this instance, Fred had stumbled upon an extremely wealthy European collector. He had already managed to pull off a $20, 000 deal with the gentleman. My contribution to the deal was a thousand-year-old Jain statue that I obtained with the help of a Nepali antiquities specialist. It was a religious object known as a Pathfinder. The Pathfinder was sculpted in an era when the Jain religion was at its height. The statue had made its way to Nepal after having been stolen from an Indian museum by one of the museum’s custodial employees, and spirited to Kathmandu. Well-Fed Fred had a connection who was willing to pay cash money with no questions asked. We flew to Europe with statue in hand. Everything about this particular expedition was difficult at first because I got off the plane at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport with a mild case of flu. Fred rented a car at the airport. We embarked upon a smorgasbord of destinations in Europe, from Belgium to Cologne to Düsseldorf, as Fred made second, third and fourth attempts to sell the statue for more than the original deal. While I moaned, complained and held on for dear life in the back seat, Well-Fed feasted on the local cuisine consisting of pickled herring, potato frites with mayonnaise, and mountain oyster stew followed by a hardy stein or two of dark ale, all of which, of course, produced prodigious amounts of flatulence. Mr. Big Time Collector spoke excellent English and held a special passion for religious artifacts. Russian Orthodox icons adorned one wall of the drawing room of his house, located in a charming, bourgeois neighborhood. At one point during the tour of his treasures he asked, “Do you boys know that the Dalai Lama is here tonight giving a talk?” We admitted we didn’t. He chided us a bit saying, “You’re both supposedly Kathmandu aficionados, and should know that this is the Dalai Lama’s momentous first trip to Europe.” He demonstrated his expertise by a wave of his arm in the direction of another wall of rare, Tibetan spiritual artifacts and tankas. He then invited us to attend the talk. A feeling of traditional academic custom and pomp permeated the small auditorium where the address took place.

Afterward, we were brought through the receiving line, and when both Fred and I were able to say our greetings and a couple of other phrases in basic Tibetan, His Holiness was very pleased. We explained that we had just arrived from Kathmandu and he asked us a question about life in Nepal. Well-Fed answered in Tibetan for both of us. His Holiness smiled warmly and bowed as we were ushered along. There was something about the easy exchange of pleasantries with this simple monk that made me feel lighter than air for days. After Fred showed everyone in the Katmandu Valley a photo of us with His Holiness and gushed about our spiritual fortune, a more practical benefit ensued. The Tibetan mafia left me alone. ne winter we went down to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Dean the Dream was throwing a weeklong bash to celebrate his success at jumping an invisible line that is the border between countries. Dean had rented “Los Areoboles,” which translated to “the Grandfather’s house.” It was a luxurious Mediterranean villa complete with indoor-outdoor pool and waterfall grotto, bathing-suit bar and grand views of the Pacific Ocean. Most of that’s not for me, so I started playing in a two-man volleyball game. The games were held on the beach in front of a four-star hotel for the interest of twenty to thirty guests. Each team put up some pesos … winner take all with a tip for the net judge. This volleyball game would lead Rebecca and me to spend a little time around Bob Dylan in Yalapa. We went out to Yalapa, a small village on the bay at the tip of a peninsula, with Manny Shapiro, whom I met around the volleyball courts. Manny promoted the Beatles show at the Hollywood Bowl, as well as the Doors and other big name acts. He had gotten into tax trouble with Uncle Sam and had to move to Mexico. He now promoted acts such as The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

The rugged jungle terrain was impossible to build a road through, thus safeguarding the pristine area from casual tourism. Yalapa was technically under a treaty the Mexican government had signed with seven different Indian tribes whose lands encompassed the peninsula. The corrupt and feared Mexican police, known as “Federales,” had no jurisdiction there. This was a comforting thought and thus a small community of artists and pot smokers had integrated itself into the indigenous populace. Manny bet on my volleyball partner, Stormin’ Norman, and me. Norman was a collegiate, scholarship player and I’d been playing since childhood and had a decent game. Even though we weren’t good enough to win the tournament at first, we did develop teamwork and started winning more and more games each day. The sand in front of the beach resort was peppercorn. Peppercorn grains of sand are particularly big and abrasive. After a week of pure sport, Stormin’ Norman and I played two hotshots from Santa Cruz. We held our own in a heated, competitive contest, primarily because our feet had grown leather-like after a gradual buildup of protective callous. By the time we won the tortuous, marathon contest, the superior talent, new to Puerto Vallarta and that peppercorn sand, was torn up and bleeding. Manny, happy with his long-shot winnings, invited Rebecca and me to visit his villa on Yalapa. He cajoled me to “get out there and rent a house” because, as he put it, “There are a couple of special guests coming that are your age.” Manny said he “needed some young company.” Manny had young children of his own, conceived late in life, and no adult kids. These two “special guests” were Bob Dylan and Dennis Hopper. We took his advice and found a charming little beachside bungalow. Americana pastels of Texas landscapes. He also created the art work for a calendar commissioned by Justin Boots – the famous Texas cowboy boot manufacturer. I had crossed paths with Franklin when he was hand-drawing the three armadillos on the paper wrapping that covered kilos of Mexican grass for a brand known as “Tres Armadillos.” The Shapiro family had an old friendship with Dennis Hopper from their mutual Hollywood roots. Hopper was a counter-culture hero of mine, because of his self-made success in a movie industry fraught with nepotism.

The next night Manny’s wife, May, arranged for all of us to go to a local shaman healing ceremony. The ceremony was performed on the grounds of a house owned by a full-time resident American couple who had gone to great lengths to make it a special occasion. After the ceremony, Rebecca and I met the hosts. We found that they were deeply immersed in the local tribal spirituality, frequently using peyote in their rituals. They were operating their lives under the belief system that Yalapa was a special place and that it had been “chosen” as a landing site to receive UFO emissaries. Every moment I was around Dennis Hopper I was possessed by an overwhelming desire to ask him what kind of mission his father was on during World War II when his family was informed he had been killed. Hopper’s mother remarried, then, one day in 1946, Dennis opened the door and saw his father, believed dead for three years! I was obsessed with trying to delicately broach that subject. Why would his wife and child need to believe he was dead? What kind of mission could be that secret? Was it behind enemy lines? A double-agent? Too hesitant in trying to find the right way and right time, I never said a word. Yalapa beach was a about a kilometer long and crescent shaped. At one end was a small palapa hammock-style hotel and at the other a cliff that overlooked the bay and required quite a walk up a goat trail to get home. The locals and gringos all had to traverse the path. It kept the scene small. The daily arrival and departure of the Puerto Vallarta ferryboat was the only reminder of a wider world in that quiet, languid paradise. Most days, Dylan found a shady spot and sketched the scenery. Dennis Hopper rousted up the beach crowd to play ten-ona-side, mad-cap volleyball, even inducing Dylan to join in on a couple of occasions. Rebecca was an eager participant and played on Dylan’s team one day and Hopper’s the next. Hopper always played with a bottle of beer or Jack Daniels in one hand. I watched one of the games with Jim Franklin. He was very excited because Dylan had commissioned him to paint an armadillo mural on the bottom of his swimming pool at his new home in Point Dune.

As a crowd of us hung out waiting for the green flash in front of the Hammock Hotel, he came strolling down the beach at sunset carrying his guitar and singing to himself. He mumbled in his inimitable way that he was going to celebrate the album’s U.S. release by revisiting some of the songs, barefoot and microphone-free in the tropical twilight. It was a musical experience to rival any I’ve ever had. He delivered “Isis,” “Sarah,” and “Mozambique,” with a magical beach party feeling. The ballad about Ruben “Hurricane” Carter was incredible, engaging and forceful in capturing the feeling and empathy generated by a wronged man who is in a prison cell but “coulda’ been the champion of the world.” Dylan’s performance surely matched any impassioned plea for justice ever sung: “I just as soon go on my way, up to some paradise where the trout stream flows and the air is nice, and ride a horse along a trail.” The memory still brings tears to my eyes. t’s always good to return home. A rhythm had been established; we enjoyed the ranch, gardening, riding the Appa-Iloosas, birthing the pups, yoga and swimming. There was an endless flow of like minds, friends and neighbors. In the winter it was back to work. One-of-a-kind, museum-quality treasures were in great demand. The Tibetan carpets were selling steadily. I was also doing very well financially, by promoting, silentpartnering, or producing musical shows for the local college crowd. The state university had, at that time, about 8,000 party-hungry students. Each show was a sure thing as long as you were in tune with the current musical desires. Groups that were popular, such as Fleetwood Mac, Santana and Taj Mahal came through town on their coastal swings to or from San Francisco. The booking contracts of that era allowed a promoter to prohibit a band from performing for two weeks within the area on either side of their gig. Bill Graham, the renowned, powerful booking agent from San Francisco, insisted on this provision. Fortunately that contract contained a clause that limited his control to a radius of 150 miles. The college was 157 miles from San Francisco. The clause provided a northern California spot for groups to play between San Francisco and the Northwest.

Within two weeks of seeing Bob Marley with some 400 other people at the Boarding House in San Francisco, Rebecca and I were on a plane to Jamaica. It was during this pioneering foray into the reggae world that a trip down to Trench Town to score some weed led to a meeting with some members of a local band called Culture, who informed me that you could hear real reggae music performed at “Jump Ups” on St. Vincent, or Bequia, in the Grenadine Islands. They said they were going to be playing a Jump Up on Bequia soon. Down in Trench Town, a guy would sit cross-legged on a tenement stoop with a basket of swamp weed on one side, a roll of aluminum foil between his legs and another basket on the other side. He would grab a pinch of weed from one basket, roll it in the tin foil, quickly twist the two ends and throw it into another basket – poetry in motion! Since money was so tight, locals bought these “Jamaican Bullets” for a dollar, one bullet at a time. The Caribbean was not the only place where “bullet” was the slang for packaging a small amount of cannabis. When Rebecca and I were in the Lankowi Islands, a small group of islands off the coast of Malaysia, we were given the following instructions through the traveler’s grapevine regarding how to score a bit of the herb: “Go to the bank – the owner’s lazy son will be sitting at a desk all by himself and bored to tears. Offer to rent his Honda 90 motorcycle. Money will do him no good, being the son of the richest guy on the island with nothing to spend it on; however, for a couple of rock and roll cassettes he will rent his motorcycle for a day. Drive to the fish market in Poco Assam.” My instructions had been to go to the fish market and just stand around. “Don’t worry,” I was told, “Just when you think no one is going to pay any attention to you, a teenager will come over and give you a nod. Follow him.” And follow him we did, back into some of the thickest mangrove on earth, tunneled out until it opened up into a space where cardboard was spread on the sand and bamboo bongs hung from the branches.

Just across the strait, within sight, was the island of Sumatra. Sumatra is famous for white tigers, coffee, and some of the finest golden herb on the planet. In Poco Assam this golden Sumatran weed was wrapped in tin foil and sold individually, just as in Jamaica, and known as “bullets.” I was assured by the local tokers that the police came only every couple of months. Even then they merely took the cardboard and broke up the bamboo bongs. Nonetheless, we bought up all we could and, complying with my all-encompassing rule to “get the herb and get out,” we hopped back on the Honda 90 and got the hell out of there. On the advice of the musicians in Culture, we flew to the island of St. Vincent, the capital of the Grenadine chain, where we hoped to find true reggae music. St. Vincent proved to be another island plagued by politics, pills and pistols. A wealthy enclave was the departure point for people going on seven-day cruises through the islands either on rented yachts or private sailboats. Each major island to the south was a pleasant four-to-eighthour sail. It was also possible to get on a mail boat for one night only. The great discovery was a working sailing vessel, “The Friendship Rose,” that took cargo and people twice weekly to Bequia, where those who made a living from the cruise trade resided – the sailboat captains, cooks and crews. Jump Ups were held there twice a week. Weed was plentiful and we rented a house for a month at five bucks a day on the windward side in La Pumpas, the last whaling village left in the Caribbean. Daily we jogged, swam and ate exotic culinary delights of the sea. Two or three nights a week our musical friends, “Culture” would lay down a rhythm that drove one to move and dance. The road manager of the group improved the attitude of all with “magic Jamaican bullets.” ing studio and produce a song. Their song “International Herb” was way cool and needed to be heard.

Part of the lure of traveling is leaving yourself open to unanticipated, unplanned experiences. This time I was approached by a sprightly 85-year-old captain who pointed to his beautiful 100 ft. sailboat anchored off my favorite exercise beach on Bequia. “I see you on the beach, frequently with your wife? I was wondering if you would like to sail with me and my wife over to Mustique?” I gladly accepted. His wife was a lovely “thirty-something” woman from Nova Scotia. Our host had served in the Coast Guard for 55 years and retired to his boat. The secret to his vital longevity, he assured us, was that he ate only one meal of bouillabaisse every day while in the Coast Guard pre-World War II. He said “That’s all they fed us.” He and Eve had been married two years and they were the ones who ferried Mick Jagger, his wife Bianca and their young daughter, Jade, back and forth from Bequia to Mustique when the Jagger family visited their estate on the secluded island. “He pays good for an Englishman,” the captain added. The boat was greeted quite warmly at Basil’s Restaurant and Yacht Club. The captain commandeered a jeep and we drove right up to the Cliffside estates. Eve showed us around the vacant Jagger home. It was while viewing Princess Margaret’s grounds that the realization hit me – acres of lawns were being doused with water costing $100.00 a gallon. We moved down the Grenadines chain from yacht to yacht by invitation. We once obtained passage on a mail boat, and spent a night on Petit St. Vincent, also a destination stop of the very wealthy. It’s a tiny island that accommodates 22 people maximum. At the far end of the chain is Grenada. Jimmy Carter was President at the time and a naval fleet on a goodwill mission came to the island while we were there. A group of U.S. sailor/musicians played spirited cover versions of classic rock and roll songs, much to the delight of the locals. A few years later, this very same island was invaded by American forces under the pretense of stopping some sort of alleged Cuban military incursion. The Cubans were actually building a tourist airstrip. Three hundred and thirty-one American boys were killed by “friendly fire.” I believe that showing up with a horn section instead could have saved those lives.

Our last free ride was on a yacht over to the islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe, the two French possessions in the Caribbean. The interesting thing here is that we finished the trip at an incredibly unique French plantation “de La Ritz,” where we stayed inexpensively. It was located at 2,500 ft. and was still a working banana plantation. We were served two fabulous French meals daily and given horses to ride. The views were spectacular from the dormant volcano’s altitude. We enjoyed tennis on the lawn courts as well as swimming in a gigantic, fresh water pool. The water was piped in directly from a spring a thousand feet higher on the mountainside and the spray rose 40 ft. in the air before it fed the pool. For brain food, the plantation offered a treasure trove of historical documents and maps from the late 1700s. The noted European photographer, Uli Rose, and his wife Honey were the only other guests at the plantation. Honey had been the first black woman to appear in a Maidenform bra ad. They’d met and married through the fashion work. Uli had just finished shooting a swimsuit issue for a sports magazine and they were enjoying a little rest and relaxation. Then there was Martin Blinder. He gained notoriety as the expert witness who came up with the “Twinkie defense” in the infamous trial of Dan White, who murdered Harvey Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco, George Moscone. Blinder had given expert testimony that White lived on soft drinks, candy bars and Hostess Twinkies snacks, which affected him so that he could not be held responsible for his actions. Blinder’s analysis and testimony was considered largely responsible for getting White only four years for those two murders. Blinder was using his sizeable fee to celebrate with someone he called only “Sex Monkey.” We never learned any other name. She said proudly that the nickname was taken from a character in a Philip Roth novel. n one of our Asian visits, Rebecca had a little bout of dysentery and stayed at the Imperial Hotel while I went to a dusty, bureaucratic office in New Delhi to obtain the necessary paperwork to go to the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim.

Gandhi had been able to do so with minor resistance because the Chogyal’s wife had become so unpopular. Hope generally conducted her affairs like a girl in the Peace Corps and her behavior had broken the majesty and grandeur associated with the power of a centuries-old political system. In that office a small wizened man leaned on a cane, supported by two Buddhist monks. When they were refused permission to return to their monastery in Sikkim, I had my first clue to the invasion. The old man, bent and hunched, shuffled away supported by the monks. As he passed me he stopped and said, “I am the Atman and I’ve been waiting for you. Follow me.” The Atman had studied under the Karmapa in Sikkim for most of his adult life and that evening it wasn’t long before I found myself in a ritual of incense, hypnosis and energy control that was an epiphany and revelation of mental possibilities. The Atman practiced the transformation techniques that he had learned from the Karmapa on me. He took me to a small, unadorned room at the ashram. He placed, with great ceremony, an assortment of substances into a charcoal fire, one at a time. These ingredients were then mixed with a variety of herbs and incense. Breathing this blend resulted in an opening of the channels of the brain and a hallucinatory experience. The Atman then began a lecture that compared the various religions of the world. Just as his teacher, the Karmapa, transformed himself into a lion to get the attention of his students, the Atman was able to transform himself. This creaky old man, who could barely walk without the support of two young monks, became a sprightly Irish Catholic divinity student, complete with brogue, as he imparted information on Christianity. When he spoke of Islam and its great truths, the Atman became a Bedouin in the desert complete with a sirocco wind.

Only if and when they became true, should I visit him in a Buddhist monastery in Penang, Malaysia. 2) I would never smoke tobacco again, because tobacco addicts pass on the addiction to their children; 3) I would joyously receive an unexpected financial gain; 4) An artist that I knew would move to the next dimension from this body early in his life; 5) A meditation house would be built on some magical land I lived on. Jelly Roll Troy, one of the great bass players and a friend, passed on before he was 30. The news was shocking. His life had been that of a star-crossed artist who, at age fourteen, started out on the biggest rock and roll tour a musician could play. He ended his career with the most money he’d ever made from music in his pocket when he entered the hospital for his final days. That check was for his work on the soundtrack of a porno movie. Mike Bloomfield had accepted the gig only so his musicians could have a big payday. The last of the Atman’s predictions came true within months when a local building contractor, who thoroughly enjoyed the ranch’s sacred herb, offered to build a second home on the ranch for payment-in-kind from our next harvest. He brought in his crew and created a beautiful one-bedroom cabin with a view of the canyon’s waterfalls and grotto. With the completion of this meditation house, fulfilling the five prophesies, we began preparations to see the Atman again. During a battle with U.S., British and other European forces in Lebanon, Syrian General Mustafa Tlass, who had a life-long obsession with the Italian movie star Gina Lollobrigida, instructed his men not to attack the Italian soldiers because “I do not want a single tear falling from the eyes of Gina Lollobrigida.” In Penang, Indians were at the bottom of the social pecking order, below the Buddhist Chinese. Most Indians were rickshaw drivers or engaged in illegal activities in order to survive, thus, a good source of herb. We got a hotel in the Indian quarter.

The rickshaw driver sent word to the monastery that a Western couple was trying to find the Atman. The Atman sent for us. The Buddhist temple he was staying at was incredibly ornate, stretching across a span of hillside in rural Penang. During WWII, Japanese troops were bivouacked in the monastery. The young, superstitious, Japanese soldiers stayed away from the old Chinese cemetery on the grounds. The monks had been driven out to work in the fields for the war effort. One of the monks hid from the occupiers in the highlands above the cemetery, and managed to sneak down and be maintained by local villagers who, at great risk, supplied him with his basic needs. The monk’s biggest difficulty was finding water. One day he moved a rock on the hillside and out gushed a fantastic stream of pure, fresh spring water. This natural spring is central to the new temple complex and fills a good-sized pool. After the war, donations poured in to create the Chinese-influenced spires and beautiful lotus-based architecture dedicated to this sacred water source. Before we left he insisted that we make it a life goal to see the Hemis Festival in Ladakh. The Hemis Festival is the oldest continuous celebration on the planet – 2500 years old. Hemis is the stupa where the Bon, an animist, spirit-worshipping sect, agreed that the Buddha’s way was the superior way and accepted Buddhism. The Atman’s final words were, “I will be in Sri Lanka, in the town of Kandy, where the tooth of the Buddha is held in the scarred stupa Dalada Maligawa. I’ll see you there next year – be ready.” We took a train to the city of Bandung, the durian capital of the world. Durian is the foulest-smelling fruit on the planet, though it tastes remarkably good. The city reeked of the stuff. Thankfully, we were on our way to one of the greatest beaches on the planet. Pangandaran is on the eastern coast of Java, at the end of a 22 − km peninsula. The end of the peninsula is 1km in width and is connected to a knob of land that is surrounded by 200-foot sheer cliffs.

This makes it a mega-wild zoo and it was the first wildlife preserve created when the new nation of Indonesia became independent of Dutch colonial rule at the end of World War II. The wonderful thing about Pangandaran was that people were always glad to see you. It was a virgin bodysurfing spot, with immediate access to a fabulous jungle and what were called “man” trees, or platforms, built to blend into scenery and conveniently placed overlooking waterholes to observe the wildlife. We were able to observe a number of particularly fascinating species of monkeys as well as wild Cape buffalos. Another unique feature of Pangandaran was the nightly migration of giant bats, which flew out of their cave rookeries and into the jungle to feed at night. Beyond all the beauty, there was a feeling of dread that overwhelmed the pleasant experience for the few travelers to Pangandaran. This was the true horror of the transportation experience necessary to get there. One needed to cross three small coastal jungle mountain ranges in a nine-passenger vehicle, for which the operator sold 15 seats. I had to buy two extra seats just for our luggage. Still, we were squashed in. Even worse, the driver drove as fast as he could possibly go, blasting at 120 kph across 4,000 ft. gorges over one-lane bamboo bridges and screaming around hair-pin turns on a long, four-hour ride. Up and down twisting mountain roads we went, while the driver insanely drove to the max, blasting Indonesian pop music at full volume. We discovered that once a month a mail boat departed from a port 19km away. It was an integral and vital source of transportation for the locals and served as their primary means of transportation to the next big city, which was Chilliachop. We jumped at the opportunity and booked passage on the next mail boat from this small, minor port along the coast. From there, we took a horse taxi for six km to another nine-passenger “bemo-hub.” From there it was mercifully only a half-hour to a railhead where we grabbed a train into Jag Jakarta. The mail boat ride out was full of surprises. We stopped at small, indigenous fishing villages where the inhabitants paddled out to the mail boat in colorful canoes to get provisions and a bag of mail – this was their only link to modern civilization. Every so often, we would chug around a bend and be treated to a scattering flock of incredibly beautiful and colorful jungle birds or an exotic family of wild animals on the shore taking a drink of water.

Jag Jakarta was Java’s capital before it became part of Indonesia, and it proved to be a wonderful place. It is the home of the great Buddhist stupa, Borobudur – a replica of the cosmos, symbolizing the ten levels of a Bodhisattva’s life – which must be developed to become a Buddha or an awakened one. Jag Jakarta hosted a wonderful museum that gave a cultural overlay to the island’s history. Jag Ja, as it was affectionately known by travelers, was also home to a fabulous cuisine. One favorite was an omelet-like dish prepared on the spot by street chefs, while another culinary delight was a steamed rice dish served out of a bamboo holder drizzled through with hot cane sugar. There was a traveler’s hotel, which meant mosquito nets and fans, plus no rattling, dripping, and disease-causing secondrate air-conditioning unit. Borobudur, the great museum, and the healthy, tasty food attracted the best kind of international crowd. We enjoyed intellectual and philosophical exchanges in the elaborate garden of the hotel, where you could catch a fragrant breeze and some sun, and exchange a little chunk of Kashmiri hash for a bit of Thai bud. Next on the agenda was a trip to one of the end-of-the-world surf sites – Parentrides. It started with a bus trip south on a road that ended at a river. Because surfers desired the waves Parentrides offered, a ferry business had come into being. Trolls and outcasts, who previously were barely able to exist along the river’s edge, had now established profitable businesses taking advantage of the influx of visitors. When we got to the opposite side of the river, we climbed up and over a one-mile sand dune. Surprisingly, as soon as we reached the other side of the sand dune we were met by half-a-dozen adolescent girls who sold cone-shaped paper cups full of psychedelic mushrooms. Just about everybody in Parentrides was high on “shrooms,” especially some really tough and talented Aussie surfers. Most surfers were on odysseys, surf pilgrimages actually, to hit all the beaches on Java’s coasts. The waters boiled in this bay. I wouldn’t go in even knee deep and neither would anybody who grew up there. The locals fished only for minnows close to the shore.

Indonesia is an artificial country, concocted in a speech delivered by an anti-Dutch-Colonialist professor in 1938 to the London School of Economics. “The Archipelago fits together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and should be one country” was the argument that he presented. In actuality, many of the islands have nothing in common culturally, historically or religiously. Sumatra is predominately Christian, Bali is mostly Hindu, and Muslims or animists inhabit the other islands. During the 1960s the political forces sweeping through this part of the world had spawned the “night of the knives” in Malaysia. One Friday night, after the call to prayers, Muslims took to killing every Chinese in sight across the country in a preplanned ambush. Indonesia inflicted the same kind of killing spree on their ethnic Chinese population. Then the military grabbed 200,000 young Chinese political radicals, who were painted with the broad brush of communism, and dumped them on the remote rocky atoll known as Bagus. A human chain of military might swept across the island, giving the Chinese five minutes to pack up whatever they had. The soldiers herded them down to Legian Beach. At the beach there was a large cruise ship half a mile out at sea. The Chinese were told they were returning to mainland China. Once they got to the other side of the boat, they were then thrown into the sea and drowned. By the end of the day, some of the corpses started to wash ashore, but the beach had been lined with machine guns and those who began to resist were mowed down and pushed into the sea by a bulldozer. Bali is a place where animals are chest-deep in grass and where every sort of fruit grows with unimaginable abundance. One can finish a pineapple, stick the leaves in the ground, and it will probably start to grow. Fence posts resembled growing trees when they began to leaf. This great abundance was manifested in these daily offerings. Having been to so many desperately poor places on the planet, I could not enjoy the ritual, thinking it a waste of food. I enjoyed the beach and the waters for a while, but discovered the hard way that there was a lot of live coral in the ocean.

Since no one warned me of this, I had the unhappy experience of having to go to one of the most primitive hospitals in the world and have my ears blown out by a painful jet-stream of water. Rebecca and I left the beach areas and began exploring the highlands of the island. We spent a week in Tampaksiring. The Balinese in the area are known not only for making exotic chess sets with beautifully carved pieces, but as exceptionally skilled, strategic chess players as well. I enjoyed brushing up my moves against such competition. This led to Bali’s final insult. The exotic chess set that I commissioned, with a large advance, was never sent. Instead, I got a kind letter every few weeks bemoaning the “delays” and requesting more money. I soon found out from travelers’ tales over time, that this was a common occurrence and many who left money had never received their promised chess set. met Capt. David in Nepal. We went trekking to what became the base camp of the Ganesh Himal, the third-highest mountain in Nepal at more than 25,000 ft. This area had never been open to trekking. In 1955, a Frenchman named Jes was commissioned by the King of Nepal to map the area. He was the only Western man to have visited the area, and David had obtained Jes’s map when he was the captain of a Gurkha Regiment. David had been kicked out of Sandhurst, the British military academy equivalent of West Point; and in so doing, earned himself a commission as a captain in a Gurkha Division in Hong Kong. The Gurkhas, fierce warriors from the mountains of Nepal, had worked in the service of the Queen of England since the early 1800s. These mercenaries were originally commissioned by the crown to rescue a British colonial outpost in India. “Every Gurkha soldier has been a volunteer, none has ever been a conscript.” This quote is from the Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, U.K. David’s assignment in Hong Kong was to don the white uniform and shine. He accompanied a general and his wife when they attended soirées and meetings with dignitaries or presided over parades and ceremonies. David performed this task well and he enjoyed it.

One day, an embittered, unbalanced ethnic Chinese, possibly an agent provocateur, bolted out of a crowd shouting “England out of China,” and slashed David across the cheek, leaving a visible scar. Politically, the British military handled the incident by transferring him to the Gurkha regiment in Nepal – their homeland. The Gurkhas had been promised a pension since the first deal they cut with the British in 1837, when they came down from the Himalayas and rescued the colonial outpost. It was agreed then that they would always be paid only in silver coin. The British kept their end of the deal and Capt. David found himself working with a couple of dozen young guards who carried chests full of silver for delivery to various Gurkha retirement centers in Nepal. Since these retirement centers were often at 14,000 or 15,000 feet, this was not a job done without some care. When David’s commitment to the military was fulfilled, he remained in Nepal, enjoying the endless-party lifestyle that had become established by a snobby, European trust-fund contingent. There was no interest in spiritual knowledge, historical research or mountaineering by this social set; they lived for drugs, sex and full moon blow-outs. Capt. David wanted to go trekking to get away from it all for a while and get healthy. He painted a convincing verbal picture of mountain scenery and enjoyable rest stops where we could swim or fish for trout. The Upper Ankola Ganesh Himal was to be officially opened on April 1 and, as old Asia hands, we were able to offer a small bribe and get a 10-day jump on that date. Captain David, while delivering those coins to the Gurkha retirement centers, had discovered that a trek could be enhanced by having one porter carry vodka, another chocolate, and a third musical instruments. He suggested another type of trek that he had always wanted to attempt. We would not go with the high-tech, North There was another reason for our eagerness to be out in the mountains early. We knew there was going to be a full-moon eclipse soon and we wanted be as high (altitudinally) as we could before that night. We soon had company. Along the way we were joined by a shaman and his young son at a village up about 8,500 ft. When the full moon lunar eclipse occurred he performed a fascinating and sacred ceremony.

While performing his ceremony, he explained each step to his son, whispering to him the incantations and how to utilize the special objects spread before them. The villagers we passed were truly excited to see us. At the lower altitudes they were weavers and at the upper altitudes they were subsistence farmers with barley terraces spilling thousands of feet down the mountainsides. This barley, plus meat and yak butter tea, got them through the barren winters. Salty and bitter, yak butter tea actually becomes tasty at higher altitudes. A Tamang village was the last outpost before the final climb to the proposed base camp. The people of this village made all of their clothes out of hemp and lived a simple, rugged lifestyle. Tamang means “they came on horses” and yet here they are, subsisting at 16,000 ft. without a horse in sight. They must have eaten those horses, I surmised, after being chased up there by Genghis Khan or some other barbarian conqueror many generations before. A Tamang offered to take us from this highest village to a nearby hot spring. It was fantastic. We named this spring the “Kathleen de Wilbur Hot Spring” at my suggestion, in honor of the woman who had brought rebirth to the Wilbur Hot Springs outside of Calistoga, California. I admired her for undertaking and completing such a major renovation. Naming this uncharted hot spring for her, high in the Ganesh Himal, was an expression of respect. I gave the Tamang man a small Tibetan purse for taking us A Japanese contingent of very orderly climbers must have thought they’d taken a wrong turn when they saw, sprawled on the site of their proposed base camp, an impromptu rhythm band, a ceremonial chillum, a snarling Tibetan mastiff and a slew of slightly tipsy porters.

It was truly the most prized piece in Afghanistan when we all lived there. he last time we saw the Atman was the following year in Sri Lanka. He stayed on land in the middle of a National Wildlife Reserve, outside the important religious town of Kandy. There were only two other monks allowed to live within the reserve. Anapanika, a famous German monk and translator of Buddhist texts, lived in one of the homes. The third resident was a Bikku who lived in a cave that had, for more than two millennia, been the home of one monk after another. The British had created the reserve. The road to the Atman’s place was known as Lady Gordon’s Drive, after the English Viceroy’s wife who enjoyed carriage rides in the area during the British Raj. The reserve bordered one of the largest botanical gardens ever created, by the famed British botanist Sir Joseph Hooker. The vast, formal gardens claim to be home to every known living species of plant. Within ten miles of our ranch in the California foothills, ironically, there was a tree named the Hooker Oak, after this same esteemed botanist. The Atman led us through a series of meditations, practices and Tantric techniques that were arduous yet enlightening. He also read and interpreted to us tales of Milarepa, the legendary poet saint of Buddhism. We also worked on contemplating our own death and understanding the importance of that inevitability. He gave me a great deal of insight and a new point of view about my relationship with my son’s mother. For me, the difficulty with that relationship was that when I was attentive, I was belittled. When I tried to be sensitive, I was provoked. Conversations were difficult, because topics were changed in mid-sentence. “It is simple,” the Atman explained, “unless she remarries, you are going to have to treat her as if she were your own daughter who has left home and returned with a baby.” With that understanding, when I returned to America with this new point of view, it was amazing how quickly the relationship changed for the better. ne summer, most of the Rock and Roll Raj, as the scene now called itself, came to the ranch for a visit.

Sweet-and-Sour Sue was living in our Tibetan tent in the garden. Bad Ad, the Shrimp, English Andy and Capt. David showed up. Charmin Carmen, Dean the Dream, Tent Tom and his wife Latchu lived in Northern California, so they were frequent guests. Visits are an opportunity for growers to exchange information mouth to ear. Bad Ad brought me a few seeds that he found near Gnar, a small village high in the Himalayas. He made the effort to smuggle them in because the plants had noticeably curlicued leaves. Bad Ad did not know if it was an idiosyncrasy or a one-time anomaly. He had grown the variety at his place in Bodnath and the curlicued leaves appeared. I eagerly planted them the following spring and once again, curlicued leaves appeared. However, they were very scrawny and provided little in the way of flowers, even with care and organic soil. After a major party, the Rock and Roll Raj headed south enmasse to Los Angeles. Somebody had the idea that shooting guns in the desert would be fun and the Kathmandu contingent headed out to blast away on the edge of the LA basin. English Andy was unfamiliar with guns and promptly shot himself in the foot. He was rushed to where the group felt he would receive the best medical attention – a hospital in Beverly Hills. After their preliminary examination the emergency room doctors would not treat Andy without a lot of money up front. Also, the docs estimated much more money would be required for what was diagnosed as “extensive rehabilitation” to save the foot. When Andy protested the cost, the LA General Hospital emergency room was suggested. The move probably saved Andy’s foot, because the medical team at LA General sees many a gunshot wound. English Andy was cleaned up and on his way in 24 hours for a few hundred bucks. It was during this week-long party that I revealed to Capt. David many of the ways I had earned money around Asia as, according to Chairman Mao, “a running capitalist dog.” Capt. David was minor royalty, a lord of some sort. With it came a natural bearing and panache, which I explained to him would go a long way, businesswise, in schmoozing customs, bureaucrats and airline agents across Asia.

The death rate in transport was extremely high for such delicate creatures, so I figured out that thick plastic and an injection of oxygen into the water carrying the fish resulted in the death rate being dramatically cut. Before the rest of the live-fishmongers picked up on it, the profits were outstanding. The Singapore government, somewhat to their credit, responded by making it illegal to export many types of fish without a new and expensive license. Another example of how idiotically politics and economics work: Tokyo and Beijing are separated by about 800 miles, or two hours by airplane. I was able to buy Japanese watches cheaper in Bangkok than in Japan, because of the incredibly high Japanese domestic sales tax. I then carried two suitcases full of watches in their original cases to Kathmandu, and sold the watches to a local Nawar businessman. I doubled my money. The Nawar would double his money by selling the watches to a Tibetan. The Tibetan would smuggle the watches into occupied Tibet and double his money by selling them to a corrupt Chinese general, who would double his money by selling the watches in Beijing. Gold, like wrist-watches, was not illegal in Nepal, Thailand, or any country surrounding India. I went out to the Kathmandu airport to oversee a large shipment of Tibetan carpets and, as a sidelight, got to observe Dean the Dream shepherd half a dozen trekkers he’d hired in Hong Kong through Nepali customs. They all, including Dean the Dream, had so much gold strapped to their bodies they could hardly walk. I commented that they looked like zombies. apt. David returned to the Kathmandu area armed with new knowledge and a white suit. He began a successful entrepreneurial life. Unfortunately, the profits could easily be spent in Bangkok, the downfall of many a good man. Though famous for its fleshpots, bar girls and boys, as well as drugs, the Thai government confines these activities to a very small area that’s about two blocks wide and six blocks long.

This small geographical area, known as Patpong, is located in the middle of a below-sea level city that rose from a swamp to become a world capital. Capt. David started flying gems from India. He’d put on the white suit, go to Bangkok and sell them. He’d rage around sin city for a week or two, spending part of the profits, and then fly up to Kathmandu and enjoy a round of the valley’s parties before heading back to New Delhi for another easy gem payday. After wearing the white suit with great success for a year, the debauchery that accompanied that success caught up with him in India. Capt. David was arrested trying to leave New Delhi with a suitcase full of gems and taken to prison. The white suit was stained with brandy, mud, soy sauce, ketchup, cigarette burns and probably various bodily fluids, which likely tipped off a customs inspector. Unfortunately, Capt. David’s arrest photo looked like a movie star version of an English jewel thief. Each day his story grew in the Indian media. The exaggerated version sold lots of newspapers. When Indian television picked up the fact that David had a minor English royal title, the local daily news programs broadcast breaking-news angles of yet another rare jewel that had been stolen from some Maharaja or other in the 1950s and now discovered amongst the decadent playboy’s loot. Capt. David’s two best friends were Bad Ad and English Andy. They brought in Big Red Ted and Dutch Bob to try and figure out a way to get him out of Tihar prison. His family employed a high-powered Indian lawyer. The problem was you could not bribe the warden of Tihar prison. Indira Gandhi’s India had a very watchful eye on the finances of their high officials. Money had been spent to purchase David better conditions in the jail. He was taken out of his cell for a few hours in the afternoon and chained by the ankle to a huge spreading, sprawling banyan tree growing in one of the prison’s yards. The murderer Charles Sobhraj was in the same prison. Sobhraj was allowed to collect money from interviews and potential documentaries and books on his life. He spent some of it building a platform eight feet high in the branches of the same banyan tree that David was shackled to. Sobhraj was shackled as well, but being up in the tree relieved him of the constant concern for rat attacks. Sobhraj hated David’s competing notoriety. He began to defecate on his platform and throw the result down through the branches, where inevitably a bit would hit its mark. Big Red Ted asked me to come in and make a contribution.

Bill Wassman had already been banned for life from India for his earlier, small-time hash arrest. I flew into New Delhi from California and met with the lawyer. With great flamboyance, the attorney explained that he had tried bargaining with some high-level politician to arrange a pardon or a deportation, but David had made some very derogatory, racist comments to his original arresting officers and they really wanted to pound some English, former-colonialist flesh. “Five years,” he concluded. This was the first time I’d been in India when it wasn’t by choice. That is a bad, bad feeling. I was itchy, edgy and could not sleep. I was afraid I might get caught up in some international drug agent intrigue and find myself in jail. It takes a twoweek stay in the labyrinth that is Tihar prison before your home country Embassy representative can see you. At 4:00 A.M., lying on a sticky, sweaty, musty Indian sheet in a no-star hotel, the Mother of Invention whispered, “You must ask!” I went back to see the lawyer. Once again the barrister professed his extraordinary legal skills. His remarkable legal ability could keep David’s jail time to “only five years!” he reiterated. With the full knowledge that I might be eating chapatti and drinking rancid water soon, I popped the question, “what would the warden take if it isn’t money?” Forty-eight hours later, at the same border crossing, Red Ted, being the biggest, had the money for the final payoff Acebandaged around his calves. Andy had a bottle of Courvoisier cognac in hand; and Bad Ad held a bottle of Johnny Walker Red, the special favorite of the powerful Nepalese official who had crossed into India with the gasoline two nights before. Out of the night came the four elephants, driven by the four mahouts. The elephants carried the same powerful, Nepalese, Johnny-Walker-loving politician, plus his cousin/brother, who happened to be a powerful, local, Courvoisier-loving Indian official … and one bedraggled Brit wearing Sobhraj-shit-speckled clothes.

For this holiday, thirty to forty thousand sadhus complete a pilgrimage to Kathmandu to celebrate Shiva’s birthday. The festival takes place in a sacred area along the Bagmati River at the Pashupatinath Temple. With Shiva Ratri only a week away, there were plenty of colorful, bizarre holy men gathered when Ira and Petra drove up. Ira and Petra cut quite a social swath in the ex-pat community. Ira was a photographer who specialized in the weird. He would take snaps of beggars who had purposefully deformed themselves or sadhus who had pierced their scrotum or penis. One sadhu had attached a small wagon to his penis and walked backwards to the festival. As a result, his member looked like a spaghetti noodle and ended below his knees. Petra dressed ala 1940s New York City: a pillbox hat, veil and padded-shoulder camel hair overcoat with velvet trim. Ira dressed real sporty as well. The couple always arrived in a 1950 cream-colored Cadillac they had acquired from some fallen-onhard-times Nepali and restored to pristine running condition. Most of the exiles in the Valley at that time dressed for comfort, depending on the temperature. Ira moved through the crowd snapping shots of various oddities with Petra in tow. Rebecca and I watched them approach a beggar who had a small girl with him. The small girl had a kitchen fork piercing her tongue. Ira snapped a photo of her. As we arrived within earshot and stopped short, awestruck, Petra was discovering that the little girl’s mother had died in childbirth in a village in India – two thousand miles from where she now stood. When she was six years old, her father had a vision that if he made the pilgrimage to Pashupatinath for the Lord Shiva’s birthday celebration, good fortune would prevail for himself and his daughter. Unfortunately, the price his daughter had to pay to attend this event was the improvised trident (a Hindu religious symbol of Shiva) that pierced her tongue. This physical symbol allows begging and usually garners more money. The little girl had walked two thousand miles with the trident in her tongue, while her father begged their way to Kathmandu. It had taken a year, yet they managed to arrive ten days early. The girl’s father finished the story in broken English with much hand emphasis, while his daughter continued to work the crowd for coins. Petra and Ira adopted the child on the spot. With little fanfare, they left in the old Caddie and headed to the doctor to have the fork removed.

The next time we saw this lovely girl, she was riding a mountain bike and had Nepaligirl golden bands from elbow to wrist. Shiva Ratri was nothing less than an incredible experi-ence. The exile crowd erected a couple of roomy Tibetan low. Giant stone stairs spilled down to the river and when the event officially kicked off, thousands of already frantic Kathmandu citizens rushed down for a few seconds of splashing some special water manna on themselves; then they were off through the continuous parade to the various sacred sites of the temple area. Besides these holy men, Jains, Zoroastrians and representatives of smaller religious sects from all over India were there. They dressed in a myriad of styles that represented the official clothing of their particular role or station in the various religions. Rather than have his iron will flouted, the King of Nepal officially declared the use of charas legal for the three-day celebration. The Nepali police took advantage of the King’s decree by joining in the festivities and mixing with the smokers, sadhus and citizens. One such was Ram Ness, who was in charge of burning corpses. This was an important position, but nonetheless filled by the lowest caste in the Hindu system that still strongly prevails in Nepal as well as India. Besides burning corpses, Shiva Ratri was the only other big thing that Ram Ness had going on in his, at best, dreary life. Thousands upon thousands of believers, who never visited Ram Ness’ part of the vast temple complex, streamed past his cave-like dwelling located in front of the burning ghats. His garungs or ‘tough-guys,’ were in charge of moving the corpses about for thorough, efficient cremation. They were members of his caste, hardened by centuries of civilization’s rejection of them and their forebears. Ram Ness rewarded the passing religious revelers, who threw money at him, either by floating naked in a big tub, standing up to fart in their direction or hopping out of the tub and pointedly throwing their paper money back at them and into the cooking fire. The garungs would scowl at the passing throng as Ram Ness berated, spit and scoffed at them. Bad Ad was a Cajun who spoke with a soft, Southern patois.

He was fluent in Tibetan and Nepali and could translate Ram Ness’ coarse screed. “He’s calling them mother-rapers and donkey sodomizers.” At one point, Bad Ad told me, “Now he’s telling some people that they are going to die from rectal cancer.” We wandered over to a group of Charas Babas and Bad Ad snapped some pictures of me. This may have been when he got, shall we say, not the best of ideas. “The favored garung gets to taste a bit of his work. I want a photo-document it. One shot plucking a bit of the corpse; a second shot in his hand and a third going into his mouth.” Bad Ad had been living in the Kathmandu Valley long enough to know both the Nepali and Tibetan languages. He was well steeped in both cultures and ways since he lived on an extremely limited budget himself. So when he said “Ram Ness forbids it,” and that he was going to try and get a photo anyway, I knew he was floating a trial balloon at me to see at what level I would get involved. “I need you to be a diversion,” he said with a smile. Bad Ad said “I’ll just go down to the river’s edge and use my telephoto lens, grab a couple of snaps and move on. This is what I need you to do: A) have a few rupees in your hand, B) stand about ten yards back from the Ram Ness cave, and C) if you see the garungs actually charge me … D) throw a few rupees down on the ground for distraction to give me a head start to escape.” I did as requested. I stood about ten yards away and when the garungs charged, I scattered the rupees. One of them stopped to pick up the money, but the other four or five charged straight on to Bad Ad. One got behind him and put shaved bamboo down his neck. Bad Ad could only do one thing – pull his hooded sweatshirt off! Shaved bamboo is the world’s most intense itching powder. When that hooded sweatshirt went above his head, the sticks and the fists pummeled him backwards.

The stars of the event were the American Mountaineering Team that climbed Mt. Everest and planted the stars and stripes for the anniversary. The slide show was the opening act for the climbers’ 35mm film entitled “Assault on Everest.” The title fit perfectly into the long tradition of putting a military spin on everything American. We went to Burma during this time of manufactured political turmoil. Burma had its share of woes as well. Travelers were allowed only one week in that country and only one visit per year. Burma had stopped foreigners from visiting in 1947, when it gained independence from Britain after WWII. Like Cubans, the Burmese were famous for still driving pre-1950 American cars. In Burma, our interest was in getting up to Pagan. Pagan had 16 square miles of golden temples, each more grand than the next. Some of the temples had gone back to nature, occupied by wildlife, vegetation and dangerous snakes. Others were maintained in pristine condition. For 350 years there had been a frenzy of Buddhist temple building. It was often said that Pagan was actually one of the Wonders of the World and the fact that no British adventurer discovered it was the only reason there were not Eight Wonders. It was energizing. I rented horses and it was a good way to cover a lot of history and marvel at the scenery since there were only a few hundred yards between each edifice. One temple had four 65 ft, gold Buddha statues facing in the cardinal directions. Marco Polo was the original Westerner to venture through. Here is what he said, from the “Travels of Marco Polo:” “The towers are built of fine stone and then one of them has been covered with gold, a good finger in thickness, so that the tower looks as if it were all of solid gold. And the other towers covered with silver in like manner, so it seems to be all of solid silver. They formed one of the finest sites in the world, so exquisitely furnished are they, so splendid and costly. And when they are lighted up by the sun, they shine most brilliantly and are visible from a vast distance.” there in that remote, politically volatile land, so cut off from the rest of the planet.

As we ate our dinner, consisting of noodles and small fried fish from the Irawaddy River, Tony Jr. hollowed out a Burmese cigar and stuffed it full of what I can only call commercial swamp weed. When we finished eating, he lit it up and offered it to us with a flourish, saying, “In Pagan, this is what we call dessert!” Another highlight of the trip was our voyage up the Irawaddy with a native boatman who knew all the tiny currents in the broad, slow river. He moved us along, criss-crossing with pole and paddle from the city of Pagan to the Temple of One Thousand Stairs. When the Buddha, spreading the dharma, had come to the Pagan area, he had never really been on the lowland plain where all the Buddhist temples are built, but rather stood on a cliff high above the river ten miles south of the city. This is where the great temple was built in Buddha’s name. It was designed, auspiciously, with the correct number of stairs to make the pilgrim pay a small price to remember the arduous effort of the Buddha to bring the Dharma to such a remote place. In Burma, the war was waged against the ethnic Karens, a people who lived in the teakwood forests of the North. The name “Burma” came from the ethnic group the “Burman” that controlled the port of a delta area at the Bay of Bengal. The British named the country after the Burman, since they were the only ones they did business with. The Burman liked to take the teak, denuding the landscape of the Karen people. If the Karen got in the way, they were chopped down just like trees. Most British descriptions of the countryside were “its mud or dust.” They preferred the wide streets and civility of Rangoon. A calming influence did prevail in the city, likely due to the elaborate and ornate Shwe Dagon temple complex. The Shwe Dagon stupa has magnificent, pure gold spires that can be seen from commercial jet airliners at 40,000 feet. Rebecca and I spent only one day of the allowed seven in Rangoon on our first trip, but I scoped out a lot of prime, museum quality historical finds.

Stathakis, an FM radio interviewer who wentby that one name alone, was a well-known gene, Oregon. He was popular enough in Eugene to have finished third when he ran for mayor of the town. He invited me to read my poetry at Ken Kesey’s poetry Hoo Ha at Mac Court on the University of Oregon campus. Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso were the featured poets and I was thrilled to be able to mingle with them, as well as Kesey. Accompanying Ginsberg was his long-time partner, Peter Orlovsky, playing the harmonium. Corso, agitated and edgy, Later that evening, I met an aspiring actor, Max Gail. Max had just completed a pilot episode playing a wacky detective for a sitcom “Barney Miller.” Max was a warm man, thoroughly moved to help people and save the planet. Max also expressed concern that if successful, he was going to be branded a TV celebrity and denied his true desire to perform in musical comedy. We were in a hot tub in the expansive back yard of a wealthy patron of the arts who was throwing the Hoo Ha after-party. There was a piano in the living room and to emphasize his career desire, Max left the hot tub, grabbed a towel and went to the piano and adeptly belted out a few show tune standards. We became friends and later did some socializing back in the Bay area. The “Barney Miller” sitcom became an immediate success and Max bought a modest bungalow in Point Dume, a small town north of Malibu. Max invited me down to check it out. Bob Dylan’s Malibu house was under construction when we were in Yalapa; now it was finished and only two blocks away. It was noticeable in the little hamlet for its prominent copper cupola. Jim Franklin’s armadillo mural decorated the bottom of the swimming pool. Max also became friends with Martin Sheen. Sheen had a basketball hoop in the driveway and he hosted neighborhood pickup games. His two sons, Charlie and Emilio, were avid young players and because I was taller and Emilio younger, we would find ourselves in spirited competition with Martin and his older son, Charlie. Max Gail was a serious man. His foremost cause was improving the plight of Native Americans.

Max had a sweat lodge in his yard to help purify their bodies and spirit, as well as his own. Another life-or-death issue for Max that I shared was the No Nukes movement. I had seen photographs of barrels of nuclear waste that, in the 1950s, had been foolishly dumped off the Farallon Islands, just twenty-seven miles from San Francisco. Graham Nash had penned the lyrics to “Barrel of Pain,” a song that dealt specifically with this human time-bomb: Martin Sheen was in the forefront of the No Nukes movement and he invited Max and me to physically assist at the “No Nukes” concert at Madison Square Garden. Spearheaded by Jon Hall, the concert ran for five days and raised nationwide awareness of the pitfalls and the extremely long-term, inherent dangers of improperly used nuclear energy. I experienced one gathering in Max’s sweat lodge conducted by Floyd “Red Crow” Westerman. During the ritual, I was struck by the similarity of it to one of my sessions with the Atman in Asia. Westerman tossed bits of sage, tobacco and other substances on the hot rock fire. The resulting smoke and the aromatic aura of this concoction seemed to create introspective insights and self-evaluations that bubbled through the brain in a similar, transcendent manner. ust when my son was starting first grade, his mother and I worked out the first steps of custody and legalities. Her attorney asked for a private moment with me and my lawyer. “My client says to remind you that your attorney is repre senting the ‘Bandit of Kabul.’ She says that will hasten the pro cess in this matter.” William VIII’s widow, Aggie, was raising William IX in a Northern California beach town. My son and his mother moved there as well. There was a great little school in the district with only a dozen kids in each classroom, lots of green grass and a view of a wild life lagoon. It seemed like a perfect school. Coincidently, Jerry Garcia and Mountain Girl were living in the same town with their two daughters, who were approximately the same age as both boys.

Our friends from Kabul, German Ted, Tory, and their child Guava had not been so lucky while in the States. In our hearts, Tory, a pioneering woman, will always be remembered as she galloped to safety from the Afghan village mob attack. She was fearless and skilled enough to be out there in harm’s way – a feminist’s dream. The traveling community also remembered Tory for her fine, artistic embellishments on the hashish disks. Unfortunately, a patron of her art kept one of the discs for many years and was eventually arrested for growing an indoor pot garden. He offered to give up an “international operation” in return for leniency and named Tory. German Ted, from whom Tory had split in Afghanistan, tried to make amends with her in her time of crisis. He rushed to her aid via Canada. Officials were waiting for him. Unbeknownst to Ted, he was on an Interpol watch list because of the informing rat’s treachery. A month in jail and deportation to Germany for Ted was the result. For Tory, a first-rate mother and a compassionate, artistic soul, a year’s hard time. n 1979, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, made his first visit to America. My friend Big Red Ted had oc-Icasionally served as His Holiness’ translator/bodyguard in Europe and Asia. Ted spoke the “high Lhasa” dialect of the language of Tibet and it was through his contacts that we were able to meet with His Holiness on his first visit to the U.S. The meeting took place at a Methodist church located in rural, bucolic New Jersey. It was a beautiful, sunny day with a perfect little breeze on the textured green garden-like grounds. Most of the Americans who were present had already taken refuge in the Buddhist philosophy.

President Jimmy Carter had recently achieved an incremental gain in the effort to stop the USA’s endless war on third-world countries. It did appear that nuclear non-proliferation made some headway during Carter’s term. Before the ceremony began the gathering was much like any holiday picnic. Energetic kids played on the grounds and there was abundant Tibetan style food such as tsampa, butter tea and momos. Local gossip punctuated the political discussions. We were amazed to see a dozen or so of the most successful of our Tibetan comrades from the carpet trade. They were thrilled to make their first visit to the West and physically support the opportunity it presented to internationalize the plight of their homeland. Seeing the Dalai Lama in America, their hope soared with great, shared joy. The refugees living in the States and the knowledgeable Westerners in attendance also shared a gestalt coming out of the now-familiar, ancient Buddhist prophecy: His Holiness addressed the audience and conducted a magnificent, ancient religious ceremony. There was an extraordinary oneness permeating his message as it was amplified from that stage in New Jersey. It seemed every Tibetan refugee who had been relocated to the United States was there and was beaming as if reborn. Most had endured incredible hardships and had refugee status early in life, so for them this was a momentous day. Ted had promised Bill and me that we would have an opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama. Ted offered Bill this “tease” in order to ensure that Bill did the driving and that I pitched in on a rental car to take us to the ceremony. The Dalai Lama was not yet a media super-star, but Bill and I would probably have traveled by Greyhound bus to the event. Ted introduced us as long-time friends of Tibet and great trekking aficionados. He also explained that I had researched and written a scholarly work on the Tibetan mastiff. It was a most uplifting and cordial exchange. His Holiness gave us a specific mantra and told Ted to translate it into written English. Ted fished around for paper and ultimately settled on a corner of the day’s program, writing Om Ah Rapatsanadhi. The part of this Buddhist prayer that Ted translated on the spot was, “Here I totally, completely, vanquish desire and hatred.” The prayer came from the Manju Bodhisattva.

The grounds were nearly empty when Ted came out to meet us and make the drive back to New York City. The car was full of the most exciting and excited conversations. Ted, demanding a solemn moment, expanded on the Dalai Lama’s meditation he had transcribed for us. Explaining that we had now been charged with a new role in life, Red Ted said, “The Dalai Lama’s reference to the Bodhisattva Manjurshri when he spoke to you two bozos is important! It means: Use the flaming sword of knowledge to strike down the fearsome foe … but leave out the enmity of the mind.” Oh, I am just a vagabond, a drifter on the run And eloquent profanity, it rolls right off my tongue Yes, I have dined in palaces, drunk wine with kings and queens But darlin’ oh darlin’ you’re the best thing I ever seen Won’t you roll ’em easy, so slow and easy?

Our ranch had acres of French biodynamic gardens, forty fruit and nut trees, and all summer long there were thirty or forty swimmers splashing in the creek. Kids and dogs were a daily delight. The rock and roll shows were steady and successful, reggae was firmly entrenched in the scene and people such as the creative, innovative, highly skilled Tom Ness, Bill Bunn and Laurie Bell had left their mark. They were true believers in green, organic gardening. The Appaloosa breed of horse, with its gentle disposition and affectionate nature, evolved into the horse of choice for the ranch. Known for its sure-footed ability, it proved to be perfect for the shale and slightly treacherous terrain of the foothills. Andrew Annenberg captured it all perfectly with his illustrations for our t-shirt. The gardens and the t-shirts had become an institution. The Tibetan carpets sold steadily. Rebecca organized summer camps for all the nieces and nephews and the neighboring children, where they learned old-fashioned crafts, enjoyed swimming in the creek and horseback riding. Kachook loved children, cats and colts. As promised for saving us that horrible, desperate night in Afghanistan, Kachook was spared a life as a chained, mindless beast or fighting dog.

He did not fare so well on a chance encounter with a bear, however, as the big beast rolled Kachook with one swat of its mighty paw and then raked the dog’s underbelly with sharp claws. Kachook was lucky to survive and fully recover. It can roll through your mind for days when, while hunkered down in a noodle shop with the owner, waiting out a torrential rain squall, and the conversation goes … “I am boy in Cambodia and BOOM, leg of cow … my family cow … BOOM … into house and kill mother. Cow leg kills her! Why America drop bomb on Cambodia?” We who lived in Asia knew what a hand-to-mouth and month-to-month existence the people had in the best of times. A family cow, blown up from 36,000 feet above, even if it didn’t kill the noodle shop man’s mother, would have likely caused her and his little sister and old grandmother to starve to death because of the loss of its milk, their main form of protein. Obesity, on the other hand, was a major problem for American kids. The kid and I caught a break, however … mom had taken refuge in Buddhism. It still left a problem and it was not obesity, nor was it trivial. My boy’s mother had decided in her true, women’s lib fashion that competition in young boys only led to war. My young son was, therefore, never going to play Little League baseball, basketball or any such thing. But, hey, he was living in a beach town in California and if you don’t learn how to play in the pickup basketball leagues, and eventually surf – you’re probably going to be eating anti-depressants and boozing it up like the other bored, unfulfilled teenagers of the town. Also, the legal hammer came down heavy – I could only take my son into the three adjoining counties during my visitations. My ranch was inconveniently out of range of the legal ruling. In a touch of irony, I was recruited as the referee for the first annual Earth Ball game where, in a field near the Golden Gate Bridge, a hundred kids pushed a gigantic ball around the Marin Headlands – good exercise but with no real athletic purpose.

This study kept me constantly involved in improving and understanding my plants. Cannabis has been used in Chinese medicine for centuries to induce appetite and combat eye pressure related to glaucoma. I was determined to learn more about the ubiquitous weed. Montreal Michael came to the ranch for a visit and brought a box full of research and clinical studies on cannabis. Tantalizing evidence was coming forward that showed benefits for the nervous system and disorders such as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease as it is commonly known. This knowledge was particularly dear to me since my uncle Ken’s horrible demise from a similar disorder, Huntington’s chorea, which could be passed on genetically. Michael also brought photos of his wife and the ninety-three foot yacht they were living on in Singapore harbor. In his own exacting and unique style he had personally chosen teak trees from the Malaysian jungle and employed local Malay ship builders to create the magnificent vessel from Vancouver blueprints. He and his wife, Lacie, lived on board the yacht and made a living moving cargo through various Asian ports. Unfortunately the seeds he bought to be planted for his research were opium seeds. When he hinted that occasionally his cargo was opium and there was room for an associate, I offered my well-known-to-him moral objection to any substance that enslaves the human spirit. He took offense, repackaged the research and rather abruptly left the ranch. By the end of that summer, Rebecca’s and my own hopes for having a child came to a sad and unfulfilling end. After a good deal of medical procedures and costly attempts at pregnancy, it was a no-go. Rebecca had issues from a burst appendix in her early teens and it had come back to haunt us. Though she could not have a child of her own, her personal pain from that sad realization was tempered by her fulfilling and loving contributions to my son’s well-being. here was always something new in the ever-evolving parental custody situation.

Here was a surprise twist: T My son and his mother were moving onto the premises of a mansion in the Santa Barbara hills, owned by an ardent women’s liberationist who had serious money. There were three or four small houses that were occupied by single women with sons. These boys were going to be given the best vegetarian foods and pre-school education, and prevented from having any part of the macho, knuckle-dragging military culture. The trust-fund money financed a long list of beliefs that included conditioning out of the American male child such things as competition, hunting, and football. These women were determined to save as many as they could. I went down and checked it out and decided it was the nicest, most well-meaning load of first-class nonsense I’d ever seen. I was right, and in less than a couple of years they had left those high-rolling Santa Barbara hills and returned to the “valley of the million-dollar brown shingle bungalow.” I did begin, at this time, a long-term strategy to make sure Little League baseball would be in my son’s future. I explained, whenever I could, that baseball was a game that taught humility; if you were very good, you succeeded three or four times out of ten. Also, I pointed out the choreographed ballet that was necessary for youngsters to safely practice this sport. From the very beginning, the young participants were taught that they could not wildly throw the ball or swing the bat, and that everything from the way the ball was thrown after an out was made, or where the next batter stood to take their practice swings, was designated and designed. Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Brown, Bonnie Raitt, the Eagles, Stevie Wonder, Linda Ronstadt and Donovan were some of the performers. I was given the role of handling stage left, where the performers entered and exited. I’ll never forget the soundwave that rolled over the stage when the curtain was opened and 106,000 people cheered, knocking me back a step or two. I ducked out for a break and smoked a J with a few of the performers and speakers. Jeff Bridges, Max Gail and David Crosby were there. It was particularly nice to see Crosby healthy, with excellent musical chops and in fine voice. I had last seen him a few years before and on that occasion I was greatly concerned for the life path he appeared to have chosen.

Stevie Wonder’s band Wonder Love was the true star of the day, although the Eagles were in fine form, too. Actually, all the performances were phenomenal and uplifting. The speakers between the musical acts were electrifying and dynamic, but none surpassed the succinct and articulate Patti Davis. Davis had written the lyrics to “I Wish You Peace,” which appeared on the Eagles album, One of These Nights Patti Davis, President Reagan’s daughter, was vehemently opposed to all of his inhumane policies and made a brief, brilliant speech in opposition. The short time I spent around her, however, left me with a grudging respect for her parents, because at the minimum they had endowed her with a mind of her own. Plus, I always appreciated her father’s quote about horses: “There’s something about the outside of a horse that’s good for the inside of a man.” On Peace Sunday, I agreed to book a number of the groups to perform at one of my shows in Northern California. I was glad to get to meet the entertainers in person because a dark cloud had come over the music scene, a dark cloud called “free-base.” I was personally saved from this scourge by what I’ve always called the “Tibetan Cure.” I discovered the Tibetan Cure when I returned to Nepal for some trekking. I was informed that my trek sindar, Nymgyl, was a hopeless drunk. Big Red Ted described him as “a sad, disheveled and pitiful Navajo hanging around the outside of a reservation pawn shop begging for booze.” Nymgyl had worked his way up to cook and then Sindar (head of the trek) on many of the major treks Ted and others had put together. coholism. That ritual involved putting powder, sealed by wax the size of coins, on his chest while he reclined. Incense was burned, bells played, chants and prayers were invoked. Then a High Lama with a candle came forth and swoosh, all three of the wax marks on Nymgyl’s chest ignited in flame. The powder in the wax was gunpowder! The Tibetan lamas’ painful addiction cure stayed in the back of my mind from that point on. One night, after a sold-out concert by David Crosby and his back-up band I had promoted, the Tibetan Cure manifested itself again. The star of the show invited me onto his bus.

Before I could say no to “Ride down with us!” the bus was moving. “You’ll be glad you’re going,” he assured me, “cause, I’m going to turn you on to the next thing – THE NEXT BIG THING!” Hey, a little party rolling toward San Francisco with a warm, generous and outstanding artist and some of his beautiful friends would be nice. However, I was shocked to see that the “Next Big Thing” was conjured up by mixing this and that in glass vials. It also included the use of a propane torch to smoke the concoction. We’re in the heart of the emerald triangle,” I gently suggested. He continued to profess its incredible properties as he mixed and cooked. Trying yet again to change the subject, while I figured out what the hell was going on, I queried, “Where are the guys in the band?” (Those guys were absolute virtuosos.) One of the girls in the bus answered, “They got their own ride. They can’t afford this kind of party. You’ve gotta’ have hits … this kind of party is expensive.” I still tried to persuade him that the bounties of the local finest would be most cool and mellow, but my resistance was weakened as one person after another sucked on the glass pipe. Just as my turn approached, the tour bus abruptly swerved and the lovely lass holding the propane torch tripped – the torch flame burned right through my vest and shirt! Big Red Ted, Bill Wassman and I were friends at 19. We met in college. By the end of 1970, Ted was married to and I were madly in love and showed it. Cathy and Patty took an immediate liking to Rebecca. Both wives had failed at their attempts to hook me up with a girl – Patty with a co-worker and Cathy with a cousin – and were glad that their husbands’ best friend was no longer a temptation magnet for the single lifestyle. Bill, ever the “artiste” and deeply in love with Patty, wasn’t demonstrative. He felt he had to display aversion to anything conventional with a forced nonchalance, especially in matters of the heart. The six of us left the United States for political exile.

Dean the Dream – three years in a Spanish prison for possession of one gram. The first six months of his sentence found him in a 6^(′)x6^(′) medieval dungeon. Generalissimo Franco ruled the Spain that gave such harsh sentences for such tiny infractions. Franco’s draconian rule was maintained by putting lawyers in jail, show trials and torture. On display in the Music and the Law Wing at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a magazine article that demonstrates how Nixon’s “arrest and intimidate lawyers” phase was implemented. Written by Joe Eszterhas, who went on to Hollywood fame as writer-director of the film Basic Instinct, the exposé was published by Rolling Stone magazine, and you can thank your lucky human-rights stars that it was. Entitled “Nark”, it was his first magazine assignment after some newspaper reporting, and is suitably embellished with rat illustrations – informants, undercover narks and snitches are rats. The centerpiece of the article is the description of a raid on an office-opening party by the state of California’s highest ranking narcotics chief and Marin county’s top agent (plus sixteen deputies). Their targets were two long-haired lawyers less than a year out of law school. This home/office invasion in Marin is chronicled in detail in the Eszterhas article. We were all at that party. The reason for all this attention being lavished on the two young lawyers, Mark Sussnow and “Handsome” Pat Herron, was the fact that they happened to defend people accused in pot cases. As the record states, a famous informant named “Joe the Salamander” said he “smelled marijuana” at the party and even though the eighteen officers never found any drugs on the premises, they made fifty-two arrests. A judge cut everybody loose by noon the next day. Three legal heroes emerged from this evil, politically motivated raid – Patrick Hallinan, his brother Terence and Tony Serra. Attorney Tony Serra had his life and legal career enshrined in the movie “True Believer,” the moving, nonfiction account of a man known to be innocent by the authorities, yet held in San Quentin prison for nine years. A Korean-American from a poor family, he was falsely imprisoned to cover up the heinous crimes, including murder, committed by an informant for the police. Tony Serra got him out of jail by exposing a government operation designed to keep vile thugs, such as this informant, on the streets.

Patty Hearst had been held blindfolded in a closet for 45 days, where she had been sexually molested by the ringleader of her captors, the Symbionese Liberation Army. It was a political “army” with seven members. In her defense, part of what Terrance Hallinan first offered was “… when the blindfold was removed she felt as if she was on an LSD trip. Everything appeared so distorted and terrible she believed and feared she was losing her sanity.” Hallinan was quickly removed as her attorney for this and other remarks in a very substantial and succinct defense. The hindsight of history and later acceptance of such psychological conditions as the “Stockholm Syndrome,” would prove that he was onto something. The third legal crusader was Patrick Hallinan. After the aforementioned raid, a phony legal case was cooked up against him. We never learned the details or wanted to. None of these three was arrested the night of the raid because, earlier in the evening, Patrick Hallinan had knocked down the Assistant D.A. during an argument over certain devious and illegal tactics which, ironically, would shortly be applied at that very party, that very night. Embarrassment over the fight caused the three lawyers and their wives, along with most other professional types, to leave the party, thus avoiding the bust. The incident did make the morning papers, and in his morning-after column in the San Francisco Chronicle, famous social satirist and gossip columnist Herb Caen managed to add some humor to the “affaire de legal” in the high-rolling Marin hills. Herb Caen, as was his literary gift, gave his morning readers a chuckle: WONDERING MUSE:Wasn’t the MilI Valley potbust that netted Atty.Mark Susnow really aimed at Atty.Patrick Hallinan？ So goes the informed talkHallinan left the party unexpeetedly early after a fight in which he decked S.F.Asst.D.A.Jerry Eisenbergwithwhat onewitness callsthe most fantasticright cross you ever saw” Eisenberg and Hallinanmade upIater after Patrick saidDont we Jews have enough trouble without fighting each other?

In 1963, a band of beatniks arrived in Kathmandu. They were led by a man who had renounced his citizenship and believed it was time to carry Western philosophy to the East. The crazy wisdom of Jack Kerouac’s “Dharma Bums” mixed with the romance-of-the-road view of Robert Louis Stevenson, whose credo was: “It’s the journey, not the destination.” When they arrived, they set up their campground around a compound on the far reaches of the Valley. A runner was dispatched from the Palace. He invited the leader to have an audience with the King. The King thought they were a tribe of sadhus with long hair. After the details of what had happened were pieced to-gether, it seemed time to find freedom somewhere else youth hostel Europass-train to last-class Mediterranean ferry trip. Bill and Ted had motorcycled across Europe and made it to Turkey. I traveled to Europe and left for Morocco to do some fantastic horseback riding near Fez. These traveling adventures were among the early, common bonds of our lasting friendship. Bill preferred the lush and peaceful Spanish island of Ibiza. He felt we could make a living there as its tourism evolved from the “cheapskate-traveler trek” into a destination for the rich and famous. Only problems: Dean the Dream had left the Spanish islands for a Spanish jail; the governance of the island was questionable and would most likely not be hospitable to our freewheeling, adventurous spirit as long as Generalissimo Franco was alive, and it looked like a designated regency might run the place in his name for another decade. “Afghanistan,” I chimed in. “Clean air, clean water, legal everything. There’s even a money market I heard about where you can change any currency in the world for any other.
