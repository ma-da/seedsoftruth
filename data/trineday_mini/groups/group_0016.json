They will therefore be \"repelled\" by gravity. This repulsion, however, will be quite a bit less than the electrostatic attraction, so a compromise position will be established at such a distance that everything will be in equilibrium. In the atomic structure there are therefore the electric field forces holding the electrons onto the nucleus, the magnetic forces fixing them in position, the gravitational forces tending to push them away and resulting in a compromised location, with the tempic field contributing to the dynamic conditions within and contiguous to the structure. All these forces have been developed from the basic concepts already put forward. They are possible of confirmation by experiment if we ask nature the right questions. These same forces extend beyond the atom into molecular chemistry, crystal forms, and amorphous aggregates. These same forces exist within the atomic nuclei together with others, resulting from the interpenetration of the fields and their coherence. Matter, though magnificently complex, is elegantly simple in its basic structure when understood. **Definition of Unusual Terms** *Aggregate* ~ The physical assembly of particles as separate units. *Amorphous* ~ Assembly of matter in which control is largely random. ***Awareness* ~ The relationship between a Being and all else.** *Coherence* ~ The condition when two or more fields of the same kind and direction combine into a single field. *Creator* ~ The primary Cause for the existence of Awareness, Reality and its perception. *Crystal* ~ Assembly of matter in which control is largely sequential. *Fabric* ~ Grouping of three of the basic Parameters according to derivation and contiguous characteristics. *Integration* ~ The summation of bits of the same kind into a whole. *Parameter* ~ One of the twelve basic principles upon which all Reality perceived by Awareness is based. ***Percipitation* ~ Bringing Reality totally within the Perception of Awareness.** *Personal* ~ Pertaining to the identity of a Being. *Plasm* ~ Assembly of matter in which control is largely free will. ***Quadrature* ~ A special operation by which a broadside (at right angles) relationship is established.** *Skew* ~ The geometrical configuration in which certain fields have tangential as well as radial components. *Tempic* ~ The field parameter of Change *Tensor* ~ Pertaining to a configuration of radiated energy which is self-contained. **Section Two** **The Q Concept** If we consider the fraction 2/3, we see that we are comparing the number 2 with the number 3.

If, however, they do not apply to the same reality, then one of two things result: i.e., a conversion must be made or we agree that we cannot deal with the situation. Suppose we are considering 2 apples and 3 pears. They are both fruit and have many features in common. The fraction 2/3 tells us that of the 5 fruit, 2 are of one kind and 3 are of another, and that we have 2/3 as many of one kind as we have of the other, and 3/2 of the converse. If we rewrite the fraction in the following form 2/3|5 this nomenclature will tell us all of the above in one glance; namely, that we have 5 articles, having a factor in common which we are comparing, and that we have 2 of one kind and 3 of the other. Written 3/2|5 tells us precisely the same thing except that the order of comparison is reversed. If we write i2/j3|5 we realize at once that 2 somethings lie along the x axis and 3 somethings lie along the y axis, but that we are considering their numerical values only. If we write i2/j3|5 we realize that we are comparing two vectors in a quite normal manner. In fact, we are so familiar with vectors that the mere presence of the i and j notation tell us the whole story with respect to these two vectors. Therefore, the vertical line and what is to the right of it may properly be omitted. Consider next the problem of zero and infinity. If we define infinity as the largest number in which we have any interest and zero as the smallest number in which we have any interest, and if we maintain exactly the same degree of interest in both, then unity must lie exactly halfway between our zero and infinity. We may tell this story in our nomenclature as follows: 0/∞|1 or ∞/0|1. Consider next the situation with respect to differentials. The quantity dy/dx implies that there exists a relationship between y and x and that there are no aspects not included in this relationship. If, however, there are unrelated aspects, then dy/dx implies that only the related aspects are being considered. To a limited extent we get around this difficulty by \"conversion factors\" or scale constants, but these means do not allow us to cross the gap between one type of reality to a totally different type.

The foregoing, though interesting, is not essential to the handling of ordinary concepts and their mathematics. However, there are certain transcendental concepts which do not lend themselves to a mathematical analysis unless we use such devices to orient them within the framework of the mathematics we have learned to understand. We are all familiar (or think we are) with the term \"NOW\" meaning the present. We speak of the past, present and future and consider \"now\" as the bracket in time with which we are immediately concerned. However, no matter how precisely we define it, we cannot establish exactly what the present or now really is, except that it is vaguely a dividing point between the past and the future. Nevertheless, we know quite well instinctively that we are living in the present, and it is a perfectly real and satisfactory situation. Furthermore, **we are advised that, to a disembodied entity, the present is the complete reality, and the past and future merely arrangements of events in the broadest sense.** **If we write Future - Past = Now, we are saying that \"Now is a very small differential between two very large items\". A more proper expression is: Future - Past/Now|90° where we show that the present is actually in quadrature with the Future-Past, and hence need not be a small differential at all, but can assume the proportions which we instinctively know it to possess.** If **we use the symbol Q for this quadrature concept **we can write the above as: F - P| Q N This tells us the whole story regarding this relationship and leaves us satisfied that it is all in the proper perspective. **We know that spin itself, the divergence of spin and the curl of spin are all mutually at right angles.** Therefore, any inter-comparison between the three fields presented by these quantities should properly be written with the Q concept included: De/dm|Q dm/dt|Q dt/de|Q Incidentally, our observation of these three fields is always in quadrature. This is quite apparent with respect to time as set forth above, but a little consideration is necessary to appreciate that it also applies to the other two basic fields as well.

This concept is even more necessary when learning to appreciate the higher dimension. Without it we cannot deal mathematically with the relationship between fields and, say, free will. Here it should be emphasized that the Q concept extends beyond mere quadrature, or kind. It actually embraces the relationships existing among whole families of aspects of reality. Consider the twelve dimensions of Deity, oriented in four fabrics of three each. Ordinarily one would not consider any dimensional relationship to exist, say, between the electric field and probability, but these are truly related through the Q concept. In fact,** the Q concept is the only relationship which does in fact exist between the various dimensions.** Again, **we have defined a field as any region which has a unique characteristic. If we extend our concept of a region to include the abstract as well as the spatial idea, then all twelve of the dimensions become fields.** Admitting this, the Q concept must exist between the various dimensions incorporated in the analysis. Let us look at an example: This is a valid equation only if both sides, and everything on each side, refer to the same aspect of reality or a Unity relationship exists between all of the components. Note the resemblance of this equation to certain electromagnetic wave equations, which are in fact particular cases of this general case. Employing the Q concept, this equation becomes: **Section Three** **Principles & Technology of Other Races** [Assembled from disclosures made by space people in various communications made to W. B Smith, and others with whom contact has been established. Data is arranged in logical rather than chronological order. ] **Part 1** **Fundamentals** **1.1 ~ The Structure of Meaning** Meaning is something which we generally take for granted. It is something with which we live day by day and which we usually have no occasion to define. In fact, a strict definition might be exceedingly difficult to evolve. To try to attach a meaning to meaning is very much like trying to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps. We could say that meaning is a way of conveying understanding, or that understanding results from the success of meaning. Understanding itself is something that begs definition. **Our knowledge of the physical world is acquired in two ways: by physical experience, and by conveyance of meaning by others. In either case it can have two results. The knowledge can simply be stored to be regurgitated on demand, or it can be understood.** There is a vast difference between these two aspects. In the first case, the action is much like a phonograph or the memory box in an electronic brain.

In either case it can have two results. The knowledge can simply be stored to be regurgitated on demand, or it can be understood.** There is a vast difference between these two aspects. In the first case, the action is much like a phonograph or the memory box in an electronic brain. The stored data is usable only in the precise form in which it was deposited, any change whatsoever being tantamount to error. In the second case, however, since the data is understood, it can be used in any form whatsoever and in any combination with other data which is understood. Obviously, understanding is enormously more useful than mere memory storage. Where memory bits can be used only one by one, or in combinations which have been established in memory, understanding permits use in all sorts of permutations and combinations: \"The greatest wealth which can be acquired by man, is a complete understanding\" (A-lan). An example may be used to illustrate these points. If a blind person who has never enjoyed the use of his eyes were handed a lemon and told that it was yellow, he could feel its shape, texture, hardness and smell or taste it. Thereafter, if handed a similar object he would be fairly capable of telling someone else that it was a lemon and that it was yellow. However, he probably would have no understanding of yellow. Three things are necessary to understanding, that is for data to have meaning. First, the data must actually reach the recipient accurately, and this is not nearly as easy as it looks. It must reach him either through his physical senses, or through direct mind contact, both of which are subject to distortions. Second, the recipient must be coded to receive the information. That is, each bit of information must be significant to him; it must have its own meaning in its own right. Third, the recipient must be able to process the data, which is the fitting of it together until it becomes an integrated whole, which is meaningful and self-consistent. To these three major steps may be added a fourth, which is essentially the cross-checking of meaning with others who have been exposed to the same data. There exist many aids to understanding, such as formal logic, mathematics, computers, and methods of thinking which in themselves are close to intuition. In what follows, use will be made of any and all aids to understanding. However, it cannot be stressed too strongly that in nature there are certain fundamentals upon which all else is predicated, and an understanding of the more complex cannot be attained until the fundamentals are completely understood.

This does not mean merely committing to memory certain formulas that appear to work. **When properly understood, this universe in which we find ourselves is beautifully simple. It is not at all the mathematical monstrosity with which we are accustomed to deal in our conventional science.** True, the basic principles are foreign to our scholastic training, but they are strictly in accordance with what we know instinctively to be true. We are actually born with a better understanding of our universe than we boast of after a college graduation. In formal geometry we base our reasoning on certain axioms, which we hold to be self-evident truths. The fact that we can build an integrated, meaningful, and self-consistent whole on these axioms gives us confidence in them. What would our attitude be if we found that the farther we advanced in geometry the more corrections we had to apply to make things come out right? We most certainly should question the validity of our precious axioms, or our methods, or both. In our conventional science we have assumed certain things to be self-evident, and we have built a very complicated structure on them. We actually are finding, however, that we have to apply more and more corrections to make our philosophy work. In fact, we now apply so many corrections that we have formed the habit and consider that to do so is perfectly natural and in the orderly course of events. We are so far along this road that it is difficult even to look back, let alone to return to our axioms for a reappraisal and maybe a fresh start. In what follows a complete new start is attempted. No apology will be made for this approach, and no explanations will be given beyond those believed to be necessary for an understanding of the subject. As a matter of fact, a useful preliminary ceremony would be a good brain washing. It should be remembered that no one can really teach; they can only help others to learn. **1.2 ~ The Rectilinear Concept** As a first consideration let us consider what space appears to be to us. We have no doubts about its volumetric nature, although we have no senses by which we can observe this condition. We conclude that space is volumetric by the nature of things which we find in it.

We have no doubts about its volumetric nature, although we have no senses by which we can observe this condition. We conclude that space is volumetric by the nature of things which we find in it. What would it be like if everything were removed from space? Would we even have space? Can we conceive of a space structure completely devoid of matter or energy in any form; real empty space? What would such space be like? If we were disembodied entities located in such a space, how could we identify our position or describe where or how we were? What sort of yardstick could we use? These and many more similar questions must be faced squarely by those seeking understanding. When one has satisfied himself by actually doing it - that he can conceive of space with absolutely nothing in it, and is not too terrified of his creation, he is then in a position to take the next step, namely to find his way about in it. An arbitrary decision can be made to refer all concepts to where the investigator conceives himself to be, thereby establishing a point. He can next conceive of an adjacent point, thereby establishing a line. By turning in various directions he can establish the concepts of surfaces and volumes. But no matter what he does after that, the investigator cannot add more concepts to the space itself. He therefore concludes that what he instinctively felt soon after he first conceived the empty space, that it was volumetric, and nothing more, is correct. The foregoing is actually an exercise in mental gymnastics, but as physical exercise is necessary for body-building, so are these exercises necessary for the building of understanding. It is absolutely necessary to satisfy oneself on these points before going on to the next concept. The next step is to conceive of a way of getting about in this empty space, and to realize that one has done so when the operation is complete. The concept of an adjacent position, or point, is a good approach, and here again the operation becomes one of mental gymnastics, and a lot of manipulation and practice is necessary to get the feel of the situation. As one gains in understanding of the properties of space, the various geometries become evident, and it becomes increasingly obvious that a wide variety can be made to work, if certain basic parameters are admitted. However, since our concern is primarily with our space and our universe, we will want to select the geometry that best fits our experience.

Ordinary Euclidean or rectilinear geometry is quite familiar and comprehensible to us, and we can understand easily how it can be applied to space as we conceive it. We can understand a sideways, forwards-backwards, up-down concept, or expressed mathematically, and x, y and z axis. Also, we experience no great difficulty in conceiving of these three axes as converging at right angles to a single point and extending outward there from to enormous distances. **We can even introduce the idea of infinity in any direction as being somewhat beyond the farthest distance in which we have any interest.** In our rectilinear concept we can conceive of such a thing as a straight line, although we might be hard put to define it, since the concept is in itself axiomatic. However, if we understand what a straight line actually is in our concept and we are sure that others with whom we communicate also have the same understanding, we can use it as a real datum point in our appreciation of our universe. This point is of particular significance in what is to follow, as it is one of the few solid anchors we have on which to fasten our understanding. Let us never lose sight of this concept of a straight line, as entirely distinct from the behavior of matter or energy. Our rectilinear concept at once validates our Euclidean geometry. Furthermore, it removes any limitations which might be imposed on it by either great or small distances. It provides us with a clear-cut framework within which we can think our way about in space. We should satisfy ourselves that this concept actually is a necessary and sufficient condition for this purpose, although we remember that its selection was arbitrary and that other geometries probably would work just as well. However, since we have made our decision to use the rectilinear concept, we must be prepared to stick to our decision unless and until proved wrong. As a matter of fact, any geometry can be used, and will work within the limiting parameters of its definitions. It is only when extended beyond these limits that corrections become necessary. But even with the corrections, the geometry itself does not become invalid, only the things we expect it to do. **1.3 ~ Relativity of Measurement** In our concept of space, one of our first needs is for methods of measurement. We want to fix distances and directions, and we want to be sure that what we measure stays measured at the value we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:40:bb28e7b89334", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9624, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "limiting parameters of its definitions.

But even with the corrections, the geometry itself does not become invalid, only the things we expect it to do. **1.3 ~ Relativity of Measurement** In our concept of space, one of our first needs is for methods of measurement. We want to fix distances and directions, and we want to be sure that what we measure stays measured at the value we measure. We can agree upon some arbitrary distance between two points of which we can conceive, and make our measurements in terms of this distance as a unit, or standard, if you please. But can we be sure that the two points which form our standard stay put? And would it actually make any difference if they didn't? Is there any characteristic of our space which would tell us if our standard changed? As a matter of fact, if there were, such a property itself would make an excellent standard. We are forced to the conclusion that, (a) **absolute distances in space as determined by properties of space cannot exist, all measurements being relative to some arbitrary standard,** and (b) so long as ALL the measurements in which we are interested are made relative to the same arbitrary standard, it doesn't matter if they do change, as we have no way of knowing anyway. To get ahead of ourselves a bit, we might discuss the use of the so-called constant quantity, the velocity of light, as a standard of distance. This implies two assumptions: (a) that some quantity, time, is fixed somehow so that a measurement can be made relative to it, and (b) that we can be sure that light will behave in a ladylike manner with respect to our rectilinear geometry. At first this may seem to be an attractive way out, but a little consideration will show that it merely trades one difficult problem for two more which are inherently just as difficult. These maters will form the subject of a later section where it will be shown that the problem is even more complex than appears above. Fortunately, there is a solution which is at once simple and satisfying, but a good deal of preliminary conditioning must be endured before this concept can be understood. **1.4 ~ Basic Reality** Having conceived of completely empty space and satisfied ourselves regarding the geometry of it and the limitations of measurement which are inherent in it, we may quite properly ask ourselves, how real it is it? Does our space, the space which surrounds us, actually have these characteristics? We know that our space contains lots of things we consider as quite real, and we may ask of what are they made, and what is their basic reality?

We know that our space contains lots of things we consider as quite real, and we may ask of what are they made, and what is their basic reality? To conceive of an abstract quality and assign to it concrete properties and then call it a real substance is most unsatisfactory in the face of our notions regarding everyday matter. We would much prefer to have something more tangible as a starting point. Consequently,** even though reality actually is a concept just as intangible as our rectilinear concept, it might assist understanding if some primordial quantity could be introduced as a medium of expression. ** **The early postulation of ether and the still earlier Greek Ylm might fulfill this requirement. **Both were considered to be all-pervading strictly continuous substances out of which matter was fabricated, and to have whatever properties were necessary for the formation of matter, without regard to how conflicting these properties might be. There is no fundamental objection to the use of such a medium of expression, since we will find that all references to it actually cancel out anyway. However, if it will serve as a crutch to help us in our first faltering steps, by all mean let's use it. **In our considerations of Ylm or ether we have something that is structureless, imponderable, and without boundaries, and in every sense intangible.** Our concept of space provides a place in which we can conceive of the ether as being located, but by what manipulation can we convert this imponderable substance into ponderable matter? Instinctively we know that we must make use of space as we have it, and that which we find therein, if we are to designate reality as distinct from the continuous background of ether. If we cannot designate some portion of the ether as being unique and distinguishable from all the rest, then we cannot say that we have established any degree of reality. What is required then is for us to conceive of something which may be done, some manipulation which when completed will designate without uncertainty a certain region as being unique above all others, and therefore real. Ordinary spatial measurement we know to be inadequate since they are all relative to the arbitrary standard with which they were measured. Obviously what is needed is something which in itself is absolute: something that will display the same value no matter where or how it is inspected, something against which a measurement may be made with assurance that when made it will not change. Furthermore, to assume the arbitrary injection of such a standard merely begs the question, since we transfer", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:42:312cbe34b20b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9626, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "measurement we know to be inadequate since they are all relative to the arbitrary standard with which they were measured.

Furthermore, to assume the arbitrary injection of such a standard merely begs the question, since we transfer the question of reality from the substance to the yardstick that measured it, without yet establishing the reality of the yardstick. No, we must find that for which we seek in our concept of space itself. **1.5 ~ The Concept of Spin** **There is one, and only one, concept that is absolute in its own right in rectilinear space, and that is the concept of spin. **The word should be understood in the sense of a manipulation, or process, performed within the concept of space as we have conceived it, or performed on the ether within it. Either approach is valid. Imagine two points in rectilinear space, with a straight line joining them. Imagine that another line which started out coincident with the first is swung around one of the points until it is again coincident with its initial position. Something has been done, once, and the concept of it having been done is established. No matter how big or small our region may become relative to some yardstick, the rotation once around remains the same. So also are absolute, multiple and factional rotations. **It is at once apparent that this concept of spin, extended through a place rotating about a line, and extending to infinity can be made to encompass our entire concept of rectilinear space.** We can fill all space with a single spin, or any portion thereof, or we can fill it with many spins. Furthermore, we can conceive of the many spins being oriented in many ways, and having many manners of distribution. But the important thing to understand is that a region which is spinning is distinguishable from regions which are not, and that the actual spin is independent of any arbitrary standard of measurement. At this point it must be noted that nothing is said about the rate of spin; only that spin takes place. Earlier we toyed with a concept of time which we held in abeyance because the concept added nothing to our concept of space and only posed more problems than it solves. We do not need to introduce time so long as we recognize the intervals of spin; that is, the relative angles of displacement at each comparative measurement. Understanding this point is vital to an understanding of spin. It will be shown later that **time is a consequence of spin, and not something by which spin may be measured.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:43:890cfc6293d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9627, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "we held in abeyance because the concept added nothing to our concept of space and only posed more problems than it solves.

It will be shown later that **time is a consequence of spin, and not something by which spin may be measured.** Having established the absolute nature of spin, we may next question its reality. By reality, we understand the ability to distinguish the reality from all else, to be able to say what it is and what it is not, to say where it is and where it is not, to make it interact with other reality. In other words, reality is something which we can place in a definite mental compartment with reasonable assurance that it will remain there. We want to be able to think about reality as a unit, and not have it mixed up with or overshadowed by unreality, or unresolved background. If a concept meets these requirements reasonably well, we are reasonably happy with it and prepared to consider it as real. If we are to understand the reality of spin we must satisfy ourselves that it actually does meet these criteria. Much of what follows is developed with this end in view, and in recognition of the fact that it may be difficult to accept the status of reality for something which seems to be merely a mental manipulation. Even though the concept of spin may not be too acceptable at first as a basic reality, when its many properties are explored and found to coincide with observed properties of matter, and when from these properties may be predicted the laws which we know matter to follow, the status of spin most certainly will be enhanced and with increased understanding will come greater confidence in the beautiful simplicity of the rectilinear concept of space within which spin manifests as the basic reality. In fact, we will find that we need no further foundations upon which to build our complete understanding of the material universe with all its glittering apparent complexity. **Part 2** **The Structure of Spin** **2.1 ~ The Spin Mechanism** **The concept of spin is fundamental in nature and is the only concept in nature which is absolute in its own right.** The idea of spin has been associated integrally with the idea of units, multiples and fractions of complete revolutions, and these units are completely independent of any yardstick with which they may be measured. We can conceive of enormously large and enormously small numbers. These are applicable directly to spin and have exactly the same significance with respect to any particular spin to which they may be applied. Within any interval of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:44:5c3f59d41393", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9628, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "nature which is absolute in its own right.** The idea of spin has been associated integrally with the idea of units, multiples and fractions of complete revolutions, and these units are completely independent of any yardstick with which they may be measured. We can conceive of enormously large and enormously small numbers. These are applicable directly to spin and have exactly the same significance with respect to any particular spin to which they may be applied. Within any interval of attention, spin may make many revolutions, one revolution only, or even a minute fraction of a revolution, without losing in any way its absolute nature. In fact, within any interval of attention, it need not actually turn at all, but merely display a tendency to turn, or be ready to turn. Or again, using our familiar concept of time (which incidentally we shall have to modify severely), we could say that one revolution completed in eternity would still be valid. In other words, **there are no intrinsic limits imposed on spin. We can think about it exactly the same way as we can think about any pure number, for that is precisely what it is: the basic number of our material universe.** In our concept of rectilinear space we conceived of a single spin being present, centered about a point and extending out indefinitely far, perhaps to infinity. We satisfied ourselves that it could involve all of our space, and probably would unless we chose to prescribe arbitrary boundaries, which could be relative to some arbitrary yardstick at best. So now we can do two things: study the structure of a single spin, and then the interaction of a plurality of spins, because we know by our experience with this physical universe that spins do interact. At this point it might be well to make a blatant statement and leave the derivation of it until much later, in order to facilitate understanding of what this discussion of spin is leading up to. **Since spin is the only concept which we have in this universe which is absolute, it is fairly obvious that it must be the primordial building material of matter and energy, and a unit of spin must be the basic unit of these manifestations. All that we have in this material universe, whether matter or energy, is made up of spin, various units of which are fitted together in manners becoming to each and every form of matter or energy with which we are familiar, and many of which we do not even yet suspect.** **2.2 ~ The Units** Consider first a single spin alone in space. Let us inspect it closely to see what we have. If our interval of inspection is sufficiently large, we still observe it to make one complete revolution. We can assign to that interval one unit. We may subdivide the unit to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:45:9dd0119c8dfd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9629, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "in manners becoming to each and every form of matter or energy with which we are familiar, and many of which we do not even yet suspect.** **2.2 ~ The Units** Consider first a single spin alone in space. Let us inspect it closely to see what we have. If our interval of inspection is sufficiently large, we still observe it to make one complete revolution. We can assign to that interval one unit. We may subdivide the unit to any extent we please, or we may observe it for a larger interval while it makes many revolutions. We have thus defined a unit for our interval. **It is fairly obvious that since linear distances in rectilinear space are purely relative, and spin is absolute, the interval of a unit of spin, or any fraction or any multiple of it must be precisely the same regardless of the relative distance from the center of spin that the observation was made. This point is of vital importance in the understanding of the origin of time.** Furthermore, uniform subdivisions of an interval of spin must all be identical. This is almost axiomatic, since if it were not so, how could we tell anyway? In our conceptions of space and spin, we must understand that we are not limited in any way to numbers in the vicinity of unity. We wish to establish relative values of unity to construct useable scales, but there is no necessity whatsoever to confine our thinking to the middle register of numbers. In fact, we will find that nature runs the gamut of numbers from the infinitesimally small to the enormously large, for all practical purposes from a real zero to a real infinity. Therefore we can construct our practical scales where convenient. **2.3 ~ Distribution of Spin** So far, in our conception of spin, we have considered it to be distributed uniformly throughout our rectilinear space. We have tacitly assumed that angular displacement within any interval would be constant. However, under this concept it is apparent that the farther one goes away from the center of spin, the greater will be the actual spin displacement, and the reality of the spin will obviously be located anywhere other than at the center of spin, where we would suppose it to be, and where it has to be if it is to be consistent with our experience with matter. While we can conceive of many possible distributions of spin, only one is consistent with our universe as we find it. We cannot say whether or not other real universes can co-exist with ours having spin distribution different from that of our universe, but it is most unlikely that means would exist to detect them if they did. **Spin in our universe is almost certainly evenly distributed, in that the spin displacement is the same regardless of the relative distance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:46:b6524f616d00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9630, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "While we can conceive of many possible distributions of spin, only one is consistent with our universe as we find it.

If it were not so, there would exist voids in our universe into which our matter and energy could not penetrate, and we know of no such voids, although it is quite conceivable that they could exist. Certainly within the range of our observations on the behavior of matter and energy, the concept of even distribution of spin displacement appears to be valid. **It is very important to understand what is meant by uniform displacement of spin, as this peculiarity of structure is responsible for all the characteristics of matter and energy with which we are familiar.** Imagine a line in space being rotated around a point and away from another line through the same point. If both lines are straight there will be an increasing angle between them, the magnitude of which will be indicative of the spin. But with uniform displacement of spin in any interval, there is just as much displacement of the line near to the point about which the turning takes place as more remote from it. This is a consequence of the relativity of linear measurements, and although related to the geometry of the spin, this must not be confused with it. The obvious conclusion is that the interval near the center contains more units than the interval farther out. A natural question at this point is, just what is this interval about which we have been talking? It should be noted that the word time has deliberately been avoided, and for a very good reason. It is first necessary to establish the interval in terms of spin only, so that derivatives of the interval can have an absolute status. The interval itself can next be cut up into convenient and meaningful units, which are also absolute in nature. If we wish, we can call these subdivisions by the name time, but if we do we must realize that this time is not quite the same as the process which our clocks measure. It is truly the amount of spin contained in an interval of attention, and nothing more. **2.4 ~ Spin Velocity** In the consideration of the distribution of spin and spin displacement, reference was made to an arbitrary interval of attention.

It is truly the amount of spin contained in an interval of attention, and nothing more. **2.4 ~ Spin Velocity** In the consideration of the distribution of spin and spin displacement, reference was made to an arbitrary interval of attention. The amount of spin in this interval signifies the extent of happening, or amount of reality present. But since the interval is arbitrary while the spin is absolute, the unit of interval of necessity must be defined in terms of spin. I = Interval i= Subdivisions of Interval n = Number of subdivisions S = Spin D = Spin displacement From geometry D = S / rI rI = S / D which is constant for all values of r. But n i = I, from which r n i = constant, from which it is apparent that n must be proportional to I / r if the values of i are to be all the same. By suitable choice of units, which is permissible since our interval is quite arbitrary, we can have n = I / r whence D = S / i. The quantity D, which is spin per unit of interval, is spin velocity as referred to a unit of time, if we wish to think of the subdivisions of the interval as time. This quantity, spin velocity or spin displacement, is a fundamental concept in nature, and although we may use many and varied units for n and i, the quantity remains fixed when once defined. **Spin velocity will be shown later to bear a close resemblance to the universal constant c, or the velocity of light, but it would be erroneous at this stage to say that this is the derivation of c, since there are other factors that also enter into its derivation. The real fundamental constant is of course spin velocity, and this is constant for matter and energy as we know them.** **2.5 ~ The Tempic Field** A field is a region that has a unique characteristic. This definition is purposefully broad and includes all kinds of fields. It even includes fields of grain and battlefields. A broad definition is necessary since so far, all we have defined in the universe is a three dimensional space (region) and spin (characteristic). But we know that our space contains an enormous variety of things, all made of spin, and somehow we must explain them all. We will have to study all the characteristics of spin in our region of interest in order to do this. Therefore, we will tackle the job piecemeal and study each field separately, that is each spin characteristic manifesting in the region.

Therefore, we will tackle the job piecemeal and study each field separately, that is each spin characteristic manifesting in the region. In the consideration of the distribution of spin and in the derivation of the spin velocity, it was pointed out that units of subdivision of an interval could be defined in terms of spin, and that the number of such units was always proportional to the amount or quantity of spin present at that point. Consider a region about a center of spin, extending as far as we please in all directions. The distribution of spin is such that more lies close to the center than farther away. Also, the units within the interval of attention follow the same distribution. This is then a unique characteristic in our region of interest qualifying it as a field, and** in view of the fact that we may associate units of interval subdivision with our ideas of time, it would be proper to give this field a name having some kind of time significance. We will call it the tempic field.** **The intensity of the tempic field is obviously the number of units of interval subdivision associated with the spin that is present at that point. The distribution of the field of course follows exactly the distribution of the spin that defines it. The more intense the tempic field, the larger number of units necessary to express it.** Because of its very nature, and being located as it is in a rectilinear space, spin must be both scalar and vector. That is, there will be a quantity of reality that does not involve direction, and various characteristics that involve direction as well as magnitude. By definition of the units by which spin is measured these units must always be positive; therefore it is apparent that they cannot have direction, and must be completely scalar in nature, but always additive. However, because of the geometry of space and the distribution of spin, many of its characteristics will be vectorial. **The tempic field actually is the direct manifestation of spin, and like the reality of the spin quantity itself, is a scalar quantity. Its distribution throughout the space can, however, have directional properties and hence be vectorial. We could say that the tempic field is synonymous with the quantity of spin, although it would not be quite correct to say that the tempic field and spin were the same thing.** It would be well to remember that the entire concept of interval, subdivisions of interval, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:49:c302fbe1c249", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9633, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "direct manifestation of spin, and like the reality of the spin quantity itself, is a scalar quantity.

Our universe being what it is, a basic rectilinear or three-dimensional matrix, with the only absolute quantity of spin with which to populate it, means that regardless of what we might choose to call the various manifestations of spin, they are none the less real and are the building blocks of our matter and energy. In order to determine just where reality lies we might perform an interesting mathematical operation. Consider a system of spherical coordinates centered on our spin center, with q as the vertical angle and ø as the horizontal angle. Let r equal the radius and dv the element of volume. dv = r cos q d ø r d q dr But since the tempic field intensity is proportional to I / r, the quantity of spin in the element dv is dq = k dv / r3 dq = k cos q d q d ø dr / r Integrating q = 4pi k loge r2 / r1 For unit radius k = 1 / 4pi , also note log 1 = 0 Hence for unit radius, one half the total spin lies inside a sphere of radius1, and half lies outside. Also, the total quantity is 4pi times the quantity per unit volume. These figures will be seen to have significance later when the various other spin fields are considered. **Part 3** **The Spin Fields** **3.1 ~ The Significance of the Tempic Field** We have just satisfied ourselves that **spin may be described or measured in terms of subdivisions of an interval, and that these units may properly be considered as a field. We have called this field tempic field, rather than a time field, because time for us has a connotation that is not strictly in accord with the characteristics of this field.** As a matter of fact, our clocks do not measure either time or tempic field; they measure entropy changes. If it were not for the fact that so much of the matter in our universe is behaving in a most ladylike manner, our clocks would indeed be quite erratic. It will be shown later that time may be altered through natural processes or manipulated by intelligent control.

If it were not for the fact that so much of the matter in our universe is behaving in a most ladylike manner, our clocks would indeed be quite erratic. It will be shown later that time may be altered through natural processes or manipulated by intelligent control. Suppose again that we were disembodied entities, but this time located in space near where a certain quantity of spin existed. If our psychological time sense were reasonably good and we set about to explore the region, we would find that it took us longer to explore a given relative distance near to the spin center than a distance farther away. Also, we would probably notice that if we moved at right angles to the line joining our position with the spin center, it would take us just as long to develop a given angle regardless of how far from the spin center we might be. This is the true concept of time, reduced to its most basic form. As disembodied entities, we are able to prowl around the spin center and investigate its many aspects without disturbing it. In order to understand it, we must appreciate it as it is, not through a third or fourth hand effect as may be shown on some crude indicating instrument. When we understand the structure of matter, we may devise confirmatory experiments using whatever instrumentation we please, but until that understanding is attained, the proper tool is the uninhibited mind. In our explorations of the region surrounding the spin center, we would always find some spin. It would always be present. It would never become negative or zero, although it might be quite small. But we would find that the tempic field intensity is such that it could easily fool us in regard to the amount of space which we had explored, particularly if we had used an arbitrary yardstick to measure it. Again, if we used an arbitrary yardstick to measure the space, we would find that the spin density would be inversely proportional to the distance from the spin center, provided that our arbitrary yardstick didn't change. We would, however, find that the time taken to explore an equal volume close to the center was more than that taken to explore the same volume farther away. We might jump to the conclusion that time was fixed, and that the space was stretched or warped close to the spin center. This is precisely what happened when the Theory of Relativity was formulated. This theory is quite valid, provided it is used only in a region where the tempic field bears a simple relation to the relative linear scale; otherwise it can become frightfully complicated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:51:58437c768101", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9635, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "center was more than that taken to explore the same volume farther away.

This theory is quite valid, provided it is used only in a region where the tempic field bears a simple relation to the relative linear scale; otherwise it can become frightfully complicated as all who have struggled through it can testify. **The Theory of Relativity, therefore, is really a special case where Time is held constant and everything else is allowed to vary if need be.** Is it not ever so much simpler to recognize the field nature of time and have a rectilinear space which is straight forward and easy to understand, than to insist on a constant time with its attendant necessity for continually introducing and trying to justify such weird concepts as space warps, contractions, etc? The fact remains furthermore, that whether we like it or not, the tempic field exists and no amount of skepticism will make it go away. **3.2 ~ Simultaneity** In developing the properties of spin, the term \"interval\" was used extensively. It was not defined except by implication. In fact, it would be most difficult to define it except in terms of spin itself. We could say, with respect to a single spin center, that an interval was a multiple or fraction (or unity) of a complete revolution, but this definition would not be valid when more than one spin center was under consideration, except in special circumstances. It is suggested that understanding is more readily attained if the term is always considered in this subjective sense, as \"interval of attention\", and merely brackets the extent of our consideration for the matter. This may seem to be laboring a point, but a full appreciation of the term is essential for an understanding of simultaneity. **Since the tempic field and therefore time at any point is the result of the spin condition manifesting at that point, the concept of simultaneity in its usual sense becomes somewhat ambiguous and requires redefining. There is no great difficulty when a single spin center is considered, or within a region where the tempic field is constant, but the matter is not quite so simple in other cases.** Consider first the case of a single spin center. Here simultaneity would be established by one or more straight lines converging on the spin center. In the practical case, some means of direct observation or communication along such lines is implied. If this is not possible, then it is at once apparent that simultaneity cannot be established directly and may only be deduced. Subjectively, however, we can visualize the spin angle swept out within any given interval of attention and declare that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:52:2295cd347b32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9636, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "the case of a single spin center.

If this is not possible, then it is at once apparent that simultaneity cannot be established directly and may only be deduced. Subjectively, however, we can visualize the spin angle swept out within any given interval of attention and declare that simultaneity existed throughout that particular spin during that interval. It must be carefully noted that this simultaneity is quite separate from the amount of time that might have been included in the interval in the various parts of the spin, although measurable by any of the times. Consider next a region that is relatively small enough that the tempic field is uniform throughout. Here it is fairly obvious that simultaneity exists throughout the region. Also, that within any interval of attention the amount of time existing is the same for the entire region. The surface of the earth very closely approximates this condition. In anticipation of cases to be discussed at greater length later, let us turn our attention to something of a general case, where the tempic field is neither uniform nor follows a simple pattern of distribution. Subjectively we can declare that simultaneity exists throughout the region within any given interval of attention, but how are we to establish this fact? Obviously, throughout the region different parts will have different amounts of time within the interval, but unless we are able to observe all points separately, or have means of communication between these points, we will not know when to start counting the time at the start of the interval, nor when to stop counting it at the end. **Although simultaneity is a concept which in itself is not difficult, because of the characteristics of spin that make up our universe, simultaneity cannot be established unless the interval of attention starts with everything in which we are interested located at a single point in space and finishes at another single point in space. This is probably the most fundamental concept in connection with the tempic field, and merely states that with respect to time one cannot have a cake and eat it too.** Suppose two observers started out from a point where the tempic field was t1 and one went immediately to a region where the field was t2 and the other went to a region where the field was t3. Suppose that there were three clocks that responded proportionately to the tempic fields, one carried out by each of the observers and the third remaining at the starting point. Suppose that, after a certain interval, both observers returned to the starting point and compared notes. They would find that the elapsed time as measured by the clocks", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:53:a2b4eca2e5bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9637, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "one went immediately to a region where the field was t2 and the other went to a region where the field was t3.

Suppose that, after a certain interval, both observers returned to the starting point and compared notes. They would find that the elapsed time as measured by the clocks was closely proportional to the fields within which they had been operating, any discrepancies being due to the transition periods between the various regions. Probably the two observers would disagree violently with each other and with the home clock as to how long they had been away, but with simultaneity established by common points of start and finish of the interval, they would be forced to admit that the time change was real. Otherwise, the time would appear to be absolute and simultaneity would be sacrificed. **3.3 ~ The Divergence of Spin** It was shown previously that the only reality that we have in our universe is spin. This reality is of course both scalar and vector. **The total quantity of spin is scalar and represents the total quantity of reality. The distribution of this reality gives rise to another scalar quantity, namely spin density, and also to several vector quantities, including gradient, divergence and curl.** There are also other tensor quantities as well. Spin density was shown to have the characteristics of a field, the properties of which were identified with a time aspect and the field seen to be that which gives rise to our phenomena of time, and therefore was called a tempic field. It may readily be appreciated that since spin is centered about a point and has a distribution other than uniform, it must have a divergence. This divergence is identical with the result of the mathematical operation of the scalar product of the differential operator del, or unit differential vector with the spin unit itself. The mathematical development will be dealt with later when we come to the integration of these basic concepts with conventional science. With this subsequent analysis it will be shown why the electric field has the properties that it displays, and how they got there. Because the divergence of spin is the electric field. Here again we have a fundamental principle derived and stated. **3.4 ~ The Curl of Spin** Having seen that the divergence of spin results from the mathematical operation of the scalar product of del and spin, we may next look at the vector product of these two quantities. This produces the curl of spin. Again the detailed mathematical developments will be deferred until we study the properties of the magnetic field, because **the curl of spin is the magnetic field**.

This produces the curl of spin. Again the detailed mathematical developments will be deferred until we study the properties of the magnetic field, because **the curl of spin is the magnetic field**. This may come as something of a shock, particularly in the light of certain of our preconceived ideas regarding the structure of magnetic fields. However, skepticism has never yet made a fact go away, and the magnetic field is still the curl of a spin. Incidentally, at this point we may inject a comment that was directed at our science and in particular of our knowledge of magnetism: \"Scientists of Earth know an amazing number of things about magnetism which are not so!\". In the light of the understanding of the true nature of magnetism, this statement is most appropriate. The two things that are possibly closest to our daily lives of the entire physical science are magnetism and gravitation, and these are the things about which we have the wildest misconceptions. One of our queer ideas about magnetic fields is that they are made up of lines of force that loop around and close on themselves. Undoubtedly we got this idea from playing with iron filings and a magnet. What we didn't see, however, was what happened inside the magnet. In fact, the field does not close on itself and inside the magnet it has exactly the same sense of direction as outside. These and many more features of the magnetic field will be demonstrated later. **3.5 ~ The Gradient of Spin** Having considered the mathematical operation of the unit vector del on the vector aspect of spin to obtain the divergence and curl, and having seen the significance of these operations, let us next look at the effect or consequence of the operation of del on the scalar aspect of spin. It is at once apparent that this will yield a gradient of spin, and to this we must attach meaning. **We have seen the scalar aspect of spin to be the parent quantity from which our time is derived. The gradient of this quantity is therefore the rate of change over time over the incremental distance considered and in the direction decreed by the unit vector del.** In writing this out we have G = dt / dx + dt / dy + dt / dx = dt / ds where t is the tempic field and s the distance in the direction of del. Inverting this equation, we have 1 / G = ds / dt which we recognize immediately to be a velocity. Of course we will at once ask the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:55:5cf352d2ccd8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9639, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "the incremental distance considered and in the direction decreed by the unit vector del.** In writing this out we have G = dt / dx + dt / dy + dt / dx = dt / ds where t is the tempic field and s the distance in the direction of del. Inverting this equation, we have 1 / G = ds / dt which we recognize immediately to be a velocity. Of course we will at once ask the question, if this gradient is the reciprocal of a velocity, what is going where? The answer is that one spin center in the universe would be unstable and at once expand to infinity, but within the structure of our matter, the arrangement is such that these gradients precisely cancel each other out and stable matter results. This property then gives us the clue for the manner in which our matter is built up, and in effect is responsible for the ponderable nature of matter. **It is interesting to note the relationship defining momentum, mass times velocity, which is, of course, mass divided by the spin gradient. Or, we can define mass as the product of the ponderability of matter and the spin gradient that produced it.** Much more will be said about these and other relationships later. **Part 4** **Multiplicity of Spin Centers** **4.1 ~ General Considerations** We have had a superficial look at the behaviors of a single spin center and a peek at a multiplicity of spin centers. We know that **our matter is made up of enormous numbers of spin centers, some of which are quite close together,** so let us now see what happens when there are a great many to consider. In the first place, all the spin centers could be lined up; that is, their spin vectors could all be pointing in the same direction. In this case we would say that such matter is \"polarized\", and we would expect different properties than from unpolarized matter in which the spin vectors were randomly oriented. It may be readily appreciated that at any point the effect of the summation of each of the fields due to each individual spin will depend on (a) the relative distance from the reference point to each spin center, and (b) the relative orientation of the spin centers with respect to one another. This consideration is apart from any \"background\" field that may be present. Since spin is both scalar and vector, it follows that the scalar components will simply add up, while the laws of vector addition will be followed by the vector components, with one important additional consideration. The scalar addition must be performed before the mathematical operations with del are performed to yield the field conditions. This consideration is merely stated at this stage as being important. Its significance will be apparent later, but it has to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:56:646864d47154", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9640, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "field that may be present.

The scalar addition must be performed before the mathematical operations with del are performed to yield the field conditions. This consideration is merely stated at this stage as being important. Its significance will be apparent later, but it has to do with the fact that spin, which is what is being operated upon, is in itself the only absolute quantity with respect to which the operation may be performed. **Another important consideration is to realize that spin centers are exactly what their name implies; they are centers about which the units of reality function. They are not particles.** Therefore, the standard equations of vector analysis such as LaPlace's and Poisson's equations may not always be valid. These equations are derived on the assumption that the entire virtue of a particle is contained within the point center, and its only influence is apparent outside of the point. This is of course not the case, as the entire virtue of a spin center actually lies completely outside the point center, and may correctly be said to be everywhere except within the point. **4.2 ~ Summation of Scalar Spin** Consider first an aggregate or cluster of a large [?] by a finite number of spin centers. At any point the total spin will be the scalar sum of all the individual spins at that point. The total resultant spin density will give the tempic field intensity at that point. If the reference is very far from the cluster, then the resultant tempic field intensity will appear to originate (approximately) from a single large spin center coincident with the geometry of the cluster. It will be found to vary intensely as the distance from this virtual center. As the cluster is approached by the reference point, the tempic field intensity increases according to the inverse distance law until quite near, when it levels off to become nearly constant as the cluster is penetrated. The significant point here is that **the presence of additional spin centers modifies the simple inverse distance law of spin distribution around a single spin center.** The exact description in any particular case can of course be worked out mathematically, but at this stage there is little point in doing so, as it is only part of the story and does not necessarily represent any actual condition of spin distribution. In practical cases, there is always a \"background\" of tempic field to be considered along with the purely local consideration. In addition, there may be tempic fields due to \"dynamic\" relationships between the other fields present in the region. **4.3 ~ Summation of Gradient of Spin** We have seen that the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:57:9ca2ce38180d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9641, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "at this stage there is little point in doing so, as it is only part of the story and does not necessarily represent any actual condition of spin distribution.

In addition, there may be tempic fields due to \"dynamic\" relationships between the other fields present in the region. **4.3 ~ Summation of Gradient of Spin** We have seen that the gradient of spin has the characteristic of one over a velocity; also that the ponderability of matter multiplied by the spin gradient gives mass. **It is not too difficult to conceive of configurations of spin centers that will produce extensive regions of reduced spin gradient. ** **In these regions the apparent spin velocities become high, but since the physical distances involved remain unchanged, and spin velocity is constant, the effect is a decrease in the tempic field. In other words, holes are formed in the background of the tempic field, i.e., there is to all intents and purposes negative spin introduced. Surrounding these holes there will be represented all the characteristics of new, but negative, spin centers with their attendant fields superimposed on the fields of the original spin centers that produced the holes.** In a matrix of a large number of spin centers all oriented in the same direction, it is easy to see that there will be very nearly the same number of holes formed in the spaces between them. In the microscopic sense, the gradients balance and the entire mass is stable. In the case of a large number of randomly oriented spin centers, only a few will produce real holes, with the remainder producing \"virtual\" holes. These virtual holes are none the less real, even though they lie in effect \"outside\" the spin centers responsible for their existence. If we look at a pair of spin centers that are oriented in the same direction, we find a hole developing between them, and a \"shell\" of increased spin developing around them. On the other hand, if they are oriented in the opposite direction, a region of increased spin develops between them and a shell of reduced spin develops around them. Here we must be careful to maintain a clear concept of what is going on. The scalar aspect of spin is its absolute reality and is either present or absent. It has no fixed direction or polarity. It adds up arithmetically to produce the total amount of reality present. The distribution of spin, however, is a function of relative position and its derivative, the gradient of spin, also has direction in that it is a scalar quantity measured in a certain direction. In the foregoing, the basic spin units remain unaltered by the presence or absence of other spin units, but the field structure associated with them", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:58:def17e9309f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9642, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "present or absent.

In the foregoing, the basic spin units remain unaltered by the presence or absence of other spin units, but the field structure associated with them is altered by the presence of other spin centers. **Where holes develop, there is no change in the absolute quantity of spin present, only a redistribution; a conversion of some spin from positive to negative, super-imposed on the background of positive spin.** We may ask what the difference is between a real and a virtual hole. A real hole develops in \"polarized\" matter where the gradient of spin is reduced in the space between the spin centers and increased in the region surrounding the spin centers. Consequently, since the ponderability of matter is proportional to the reciprocal of the spin gradient, such polarized matter loses ponderability while still retaining reality (mass) with respect to all outside consideration. A virtual hole develops in unpolarized matter and may have almost any distribution from a real hole to a completely virtual hole as in the case of opposite spin orientation. The one feature in common is that of increasing the ponderability of matter with respect to outside considerations. **Where there are available large numbers of randomly oriented spin centers, patterns of real and virtual holes can develop, which when taken together with patterns resulting from other field considerations give rise to the structure of matter as we know it.** **Part 5** **[ This part was not written ]** **5.1 ~ Definition of Force** **5.2 ~ Changing Reality** **5.3 ~ Work & Energy** **Notes: Summary of the 12 Parameters/Dimensions/Degrees of Awareness** Length Area Volume Change/density/gradient (tempic field [time], how Reality is distributed in space) Divergence (electric field, the stable condition in which Awareness finds Reality) Curl/deviation (magnetic field, the dynamic aspect of Reality as perceived by Awareness) Orientation (random) Decision/free will Sequence/order/specific arrangement (re-establishes symmetry) Form (boundary of Reality) Multiplicity (allows individualization in form, a coagulation of substance out of basic Reality.)

Incredible discoveries about the nature of electricity were becoming commonplace. Within 20 years, there would be automobiles, airplanes, movies, recorded music, telephones, radio, and practical cameras. For the first time in history, common people were encouraged to envision a utopian future filled with abundant modern transportation and communication, as well as jobs, housing and food for everyone. So what happened? Where did the new energy breakthroughs go? Was this excitement about free electricity all just wishful thinking that science eventually disproved? **Current State of Technology. **The answer is no. Spectacular new energy technologies were developed right along with other breakthroughs. Since then, **[multiple methods](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergyinventionsnewsarticles) for producing vast amounts of energy at extremely low cost have been developed**. None of these technologies have made it to the open consumer market, however. Why this is true will be discussed shortly. First, here is a short list of new energy technologies. The common feature connecting all of these discoveries is that they use a small amount of one form of energy to control or release a large amount of a different kind of energy.

This natural energy can perform the same wonders as ordinary electricity at less than 1% of the cost. It does not behave exactly like electricity, however, which has contributed to the scientific community's misunderstanding of it. The Methernitha Community in Switzerland currently has 5 or 6 [working models](https://www.WantToKnow.info/methernitatestatika) of fuelless, self-running devices that tap this energy.

Dr. Tom Bearden has two working models of a [permanent magnet powered electrical transformer](https://www.WantToKnow.info/beardenmeg). It uses a 6-watt electrical input to control the path of a magnetic field coming out of a permanent magnet. By channeling the magnetic field, first to one output coil and then a second repeatedly and rapidly, the device can produce a 96-watt electrical output with no moving parts. [Multiple inventors](http://web.archive.org/web/20071114200005/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/1287/adams/adamsall.htm) have working mechanisms that produce torque from permanent magnets alone.

But this short list is sufficient to make the point: new energy technology is here. It offers the world pollution-free energy abundance for everyone, everywhere. It is now possible to stop the production of \"greenhouse gases\" and shut down the nuclear power plants. Transportation and production costs for just about everything can drop dramatically. Yet all these wonderful benefits that can make life on this planet so much easier and better for everyone have been postponed for decades. Why? Whose purposes are served by this postponement? **Four Invisible Forces. There are four forces that have worked together to create this situation. The wealthiest families and their central banking institutions are the [first force](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051115secretsocietiesbilderberg)**. Their motivations are greed and the need to control almost everything except themselves. Their plan is to eventually control all of the resources of the world, and thereby control everyone's life through the availability of all goods and services. An independent source of wealth (new energy device) in the hands of every person in the world ruins their plans for world domination. They don't want any competition. The weapons they have used to enforce this include intimidation, \"expert\" debunkers, buying and shelving of technology, and murder of inventors. They have also promoted the scientific theory that states free energy is impossible (laws of thermodynamics). **The second force is national governments**. The problem here is related to the maintenance of national security. There is a constant jockeying for position and influence in world affairs, and the strongest party wins. In economics, it's the golden rule: \"The one with the gold makes the rules.\" Unlimited energy on this planet will lead to an inevitable reshuffling of the balance of power. Everybody will want it, and at the same time, want to prevent everyone else from getting it. So, national governments' motivations are self-preservation. Their weapons include preventing the issuance of patents based on national security grounds, harassment of inventors with criminal charges, tax audits, threats, phone taps, arson, theft, and a host of other intimidations which make the business of building and marketing a new energy machine practically impossible. **The third force consists of deluded inventors and con men**. On the periphery of the extraordinary scientific breakthroughs that constitute real new energy technologies, lies a shadow world of unexplained anomalies, marginal inventions and unscrupulous promoters.

The first two forces have constantly used the media to promote the worst examples of this group, to distract the public's attention, and to discredit real breakthroughs by associating them with the frauds. So, the third force is delusion and dishonesty. The motivations are self-aggrandizement, greed, want of power over others, and a false sense of self-importance. The weapons used are lying, cheating, self-delusion and arrogance combined with bad science. **The fourth force** operating to postpone the public availability of new energy technology **is all of the rest of us**. It may be easy to see how narrow and selfish the motivations of the other forces are, but actually, these motivations are still very much alive in each of us as well. Like the wealthiest families, don't we each secretly harbor illusions of false superiority and want to control others instead of ourselves? Also, wouldn't you sell out if the price were high enough? Or like the governments, don't we each want to ensure our own survival? Or like the deluded inventor, don't we trade a comfortable illusion once in a while for an uncomfortable fact? Or don't we still fear the unknown, even if it promises a great reward? **All four forces are just different aspects of the same process.** **There is really only one force preventing the availability of new energy technology, and that is unspiritually motivated behavior.** New energy technology is an outward manifestation of divine abundance. It is the engine of the economy of an enlightened society, where people voluntarily behave in a respectful and civil manner toward each other. Unspiritualized humans cannot be trusted with new energy. They will only do what they have always done, which is to take merciless advantage of each other, or kill each other and themselves in the process. **The Opportunity. **What is new is that you and I can communicate with each other now better than at anytime in the past. The Internet offers us, the fourth force, an opportunity to overcome the combined efforts of the other forces preventing new energy technology from spreading. What is starting to happen is that inventors are [publishing their work](http://www.peswiki.com/index.php/Congress:Top_100_Technologies_--_RD), instead of patenting it and keeping it secret.

The other three forces will not help us put a fuelless power plant in our homes. New energy technology will change everything about the way we live, work and relate to each other. It obsoletes greed and fear for survival. But like all exercises of spiritual faith, **we must first manifest generosity and trust in our own lives**. New energy technology is here. It has been here for decades. Communications technology and the Internet have torn the veil of secrecy off of this remarkable fact. People all over the world are starting to build new energy devices. The bankers and governments don't want this to happen, but can't stop it. Tremendous economic instabilities and wars will be used to distract people's attention from the new energy movement. There will be essentially no major media coverage of this aspect of what is going on. Western society is in many ways spiraling toward self-destruction due to the accumulated effects of greed and corruption. New energy technologies cannot stop this trend. If, however, you have a new energy device, you may be better positioned to support the transition that is underway. The question is, who will ultimately control the emerging world government, the first force, or the fourth force? **Those who choose the latter may live to see the dawn of the world of new energy.

In the highly sophisticated world of quantum physics, however, we find that **many of the traditional laws of physics no longer apply**. For instance, scientists have discovered that there is no such thing as a pure vacuum. Within what was thought to be a pure vacuum, they have found that miniscule subatomic particle-antiparticle pairs frequently appear out of nowhere, only to disappear a very short time later. **Even in the near-perfect vacuum of outer space, energy is spontaneously being created and destroyed all the time. **[Zero-point energy](http://www.altenergy.org/newenergy/zeropoint/zeropoint.html) is the energy that exists in or arises out of zero, out of nothingness, out of the vacuum.

First, the eye-opening documentary ***Heavy Watergate, The War Against Cold Fusion, * provides a thorough, professional examination of the incredible hidden potentials of cold fusion**, also known as low energy nuclear reactions ([LENR](http://www.lenr-canr.org/)). With riveting video testimony of top scientists from around the world and footage of their amazing experiments, you will learn not only about the science and vast potential of cold fusion, but also about the powerful financial forces which systematically work to stop cheap energy from being developed. This excellent documentary leaves little doubt that these paradigm shifting discoveries can be used to solve the energy crisis on our planet - if we are willing to spread the word and make a difference. **To view this inspiring new energy documentary (45 minutes): [www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/cold_fusion](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/cold_fusion)** A fascinating CBS *60 Minutes* video documentary provides further confirmation of this exciting information.

At its best, #MeToo exposed patterns of sexual abuse that had long been covered up, particularly in the entertainment industry. Yet despite its important impact, the #MeToo movement stopped short of confronting the most egregious forms of sexual abuse at the highest levels of power. At [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/),we are dedicated to shining a light into the darkest corners of the world, bringing us together in service to the greater good and positive transformation on this planet.

We have a dedicated [news category archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/db-public/artwtk?aq=&cat=71) on Jeffrey Epstein's child sex trafficking ring, where hundreds of underage girls were trafficked to the rich and powerful for decades. When undeniable evidence of Epstein's child sex trafficking ring was brought to light in court in 2008, the whole system shielded him and his associates from the gravity of his crimes. **The fight for transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein child sex trafficking case is intensifying** as Attorney General Pam Bondi recently revealed her office has [received a \"truckload\" of new evidence](https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jeffrey-epstein-files-delivered-pam-bondi/), promising to release the full files to the public. Despite previous claims that all files had been handed over, Bondi now alleges that thousands of pages have been withheld by the FBI and the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. [While some documents were released recently](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-releases-first-phase-declassified-epstein-files), it largely consisted of flight logs and a heavily redacted contact book. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, tasked with overseeing the declassification of Epstein files, slammed the recent Epstein document release as a distraction that obscured key evidence, [revealing](https://wjla.com/news/nation-world/anna-paulina-luna-outraged-after-epstein-documents-handed-to-conservative-influencers) that her declassification task force was neither provided nor allowed to review the files. She also [stated](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5174685-luna-bondi-epstein-client-list/) that while she and her panel have demanded the full Epstein client list and all related documents, they do not have classification authority. This leaves the decision to release key files solely in the hands of the attorney general. This consolidation of authority in the attorney general's office raises serious questions, especially in light of the other powerful government officials who over the years protected Epstein, a convicted child sex offender. **Below, we present the best of our research connecting Epstein's sex trafficking network to a long history of sexual blackmail operations involving the highest levels of power.** With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info) **[Epstein Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg: How Blackmail Subverts Democracy](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/epstein-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg)** May 17, 2024 Amber Yang for the [WantToKnow.info Substack](https://peerservice.substack.com/) Starting from the late 70s, wealthy lobbyist and socialite Craig Spence [ran a sexual blackmail operation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/890629washingtontimesfranklin) in D.C. involving underage boys where \"call boys\" would go on \"midnight tours\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:epstein-how-blackmail-subverts-democracy.txt:0:a90f48b13254", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9653, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "epstein-how-blackmail-subverts-democracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "epstein-how-blackmail-subverts-democracy", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Epstein's sex trafficking network to a long history of sexual blackmail operations involving the highest levels of power.** With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info) **[Epstein Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg: How Blackmail Subverts Democracy](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/epstein-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg)** May 17, 2024 Amber Yang for the [WantToKnow.info Substack](https://peerservice.substack.com/) Starting from the late 70s, wealthy lobbyist and socialite Craig Spence [ran a sexual blackmail operation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/890629washingtontimesfranklin) in D.C. involving underage boys where \"call boys\" would go on \"midnight tours\" of the White House. According to obtained credit card records, clients included key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, US military officers, businessmen, lawyers, bankers, congressional aides, and media stars. Many of these parties also took place at Spence's house, which was bugged and had secret two-way mirrors used to spy on guests. [According to Spence's body guards and various associates](https://www.futile.work/uploads/1/5/0/1/15012114/power-broker-served-drugs.pdf), Spence provided cocaine and secretly filmed people in compromising sexual encounters with the intent of extortion and blackmail. When the ring was exposed, [Spence died under mysterious circumstances](https://www.futile.work/uploads/1/5/0/1/15012114/spence-stayed-true-to-form.pdf). Similar to [Epstein's death](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-internal-prison-files-suggest-epstein-suicide-coverup), Spence's death was quickly ruled as a suicide. Shortly before his death, Spence told associates and reporters that [he worked for the CIA](https://www.futile.work/uploads/1/5/0/1/15012114/spence-stayed-true-to-form.pdf), and that the call-boy operation was being investigated by federal authorities as a possible CIA front. **Spence admitted that the CIA was using the service to compromise federal intelligence officials and foreign diplomats. He told them that \"his life was over\" now that the sex ring was exposed, and that \"Casey's boys are out to get me,\" referring to then-CIA director William Casey.** According to Boston detectives handling the investigation, next to Spence's deceased body was a newspaper clipping detailing efforts to initiate legislation that would give protection to CIA agents called upon to testify before the government. *What you have to understand, [Senator John DeCamp], is that sometimes there are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do anything about them, not matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face. You have done your part. You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing. It has hurt you terribly.

His book *[The Franklin Cover-Up](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/franklin-cover-up.pdf)* investigates the 1988 shutdown of Omaha's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, where $40 million was discovered missing under the management of multi-millionaire businessman and [former chair](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/2023-10/40-819-198416-K-LawrenceKingJr-002-2023.pdf) of the Nebraska Black Republican Council [Lawrence E. \"Larry\" King](https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/user-clip-lawrence-king-sings-the-national-anthem/4781767). This financial scandal became part of a much larger conspiracy that involved a nationwide child abuse ring, pornography, drug trafficking, and credible allegations of ritual murder. The Franklin scandal was a series of official investigations involving the Nebraska State Legislature, state and federal grand juries, disturbing court testimonies, and sealed records. It was discovered that many of the children involved [came from the foster care system](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/us/nebraska-inquiry-is-given-file-on-sex-abuse-of-foster-children.html), and were flown across US and sexually abused by officials and elites at the highest levels of power. In his book, DeCamp discovered a network of CIA sexual blackmail operations, some of which connected the Franklin Scandal to Spence's blackmail ring through credit card records. **[More than a dozen people](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:The_Franklin_Cover-up#Suspicious_Deaths_Tied_to_the_Franklin_Cover-Up) investigating the Franklin case died under mysterious circumstances**. State and federal grand juries concluded that the allegations were unfounded, labeling them a \"carefully crafted hoax.\" Alleged victims who came forward with their stories of abuse were not only dismissed but sentenced to 9-15 years in prison for perjury. If the allegations were baseless, why did a civil court find Larry King liable and award Paul Bonacci [$1 million in damages](https://archive.org/details/97302292-paul-bonacci-court-transcripts-from-larry-king-lawsuit/page/n1/mode/2up?view=theater) due to the sustained abuse and psychological trauma he endured involving organized child abuse, sex trafficking, and satanic rituals? Below, DeCamp recalls his interaction with Judge Enbody, a Nebraska Supreme Court appointee for these hearings. Decamp later learned that Judge Embody had just been appointed to the Court of Appeals, a very substantial advancement in his career that likely ensured the case was handled in a way that protected certain individuals. \"*I do not understand it, Your Honor,\" I kept repeating. \"As God is my witness, I do not think that there is a judge or other person involved in this case who does not know that horrible injustice has been done. **Your Honor, a person has to be deaf, dumb, blind, and totally dishonest, not to know that some of this state's and nation's top businessmen and public officials have engaged in the worst crimes possible, which are now being covered up.

[According to Epstein's close associates](https://www.salon.com/2019/07/09/i-was-a-friend-of-jeffrey-epstein-heres-what-i-know/), Epstein managed money for clients with mega-fortunes and claimed to be a \"high-level bounty hunter\" for governments and wealthy clients around the world. For decades, dozens of girls as young as middle school age were lured, groomed, and paid in cash for sex with Epstein and his clients. These girls were instructed to recruit other vulnerable girls, many of them at-risk and/or homeless. *Epstein's ties to the rich and the powerful seems to have allowed him to continue to rape and sex traffic teenagers. Transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion. [A] teenager ... told detectives that she was 17 years old when she was approached by a friend who said she could make $200 by providing a massage at Epstein's home. Epstein told her that he would pay her if she brought other \"girls\" to his home. **\"And he told her, 'The younger, the better,'\"** [Palm Beach Police Det.

Most shockingly, his sentence would shut down an ongoing FBI probe** into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes. The person who signed off on this \"sweetheart deal\" for Epstein was Miami's top federal prosecutor, Alexander Acosta. It was revealed that he was told \"**[Epstein belonged to intelligence, and to leave it alone](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-jeffrey-epstein-ran-sex-blackmail-operation-intelligence-agencies-new-evidence-suggests).**\" Years later, Acosta would become the US Secretary of Labor from 2017-2019, whose purview included combating human trafficking. After Epstein's conviction in 2008, Epstein [continued his sex trafficking operations](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-sexual-abuse-women-vip-connections-f5451078) until his arrest in 2019. Major news outlets, including ABC News, [suppressed key evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/05/ive-had-this-story-three-years-abc-news-anchor-slams-her-networks-handling-epstein-scoop/) in the Epstein case, with journalist Amy Robach admitting her network \"quashed the story\" after pressure from the British royal family and powerful figures like Alan Dershowitz. Epstein used legal threats, intimidation, and even a [$30,000 donation](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/22/753390385/a-dead-cat-a-lawyers-call-and-a-5-figure-donation-how-media-fell-short-on-epstei) to a *New York Times* reporter's nonprofit to influence coverage. **What could possibly be behind such powerful government protection of a convicted sex offender?** After he became a convicted sex offender, why was Epstein [meeting with high-level officials](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-jeffrey-epstein-ran-sex-blackmail-operation-intelligence-agencies-new-evidence-suggests) including CIA director William Burns and former White House counsel under President Barack Obama? Could it be that Epstein was running a sexual blackmail operation similar to Spence's? According to [court papers](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--sex-slave-scandal-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein), \"Epstein wired his mansion with [hidden cameras](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-says-his-house-had-cameras-monitoring-private-moments), secretly recording orgies involving his prominent friends and underage girls.

Most of us want to believe that our government is run on democratic values. Yet so often, these values take a backseat to the hidden agendas of special interests seeming to be above the law. When evidence of crime is used for blackmail purposes, the victims of these crimes-including sexually abused children-are irrelevant to the blackmailers. **By failing to report these crimes and instead using them as leverage for blackmail, blackmailers make a mockery of justice.** We believe in a better version of humanity, and good government is a critical part of that.

Dr. Estabrooks discusses how he \"programmed\" American spies with hypnosis and how he helped businessmen and students with his skills. Dr. Estabrooks is a Rhodes Scholar. He took his Doctorate at Harvard ('26), and has authored many articles and books on clinical hypnosis and human behavior. *This excerpt details Dr. Estabrooks work with military intelligence during and after WWII.* **One of the most fascinating but dangerous applications of hypnosis is its use in military intelligence. This is a field with which I am familiar through formulating guidelines for the techniques used by the United States in two world wars.** Communication in war is always a headache. Codes can be broken. A professional spy may or may not stay bought. Your own man may have unquestionable loyalty, but his judgment is always open to question. The \"hypnotic courier,\" on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we'll call George Smith. Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I had removed from him, by post-hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized. First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report of the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave to his wife and friends. Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him -- orally -- a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel -- let's say his name was Brown -- of military intelligence. **Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is \"locking.\" I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: \"Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use a signal phrase 'the moon is clear.' **Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.\" When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory or what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up a division report. On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:estabrooks_hypnosis.txt:0:397e3c0cc351", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9664, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "estabrooks_hypnosis.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "estabrooks_hypnosis", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.\" When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory or what happened in trance.

Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown's answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind. **The system is virtually foolproof.** As exemplified by this case, the information was \"locked\" in Smith's unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so could not spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even iv they might know the signal phrase. Not all applications of hypnotism to military intelligence are a tidy as that. Perhaps you have read *The Three Faces of Eve*. The book was based on a case reported in 1905 by Dr. Morton Prince of Massachusetts general Hospital and Harvard. He startled everyone in the field by announcing that he had cured a woman named Beauchamp of a split personality problem. Using post-hypnotic suggestion to submerge an incompatible, childlike facet of the patient, he'd been able to make two other sides of Mrs. Beauchamp compatible, and lump them together in a single cohesive personality. Clinical hypnotists throughout the world jumped on the multiple personality bandwagon as a fascinating frontier. **By the 1920's, not only had they learned to apply post-hypnotic suggestion to deal with this weird problem, but also had learned how to split certain complex individuals into multiple personalities like Jeckyl-Hydes.** The potential for military intelligence has been nightmarish. During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine Intelligence, I spilt his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a \"normal\" working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member. The joker was Jones B, the second personality, formerly apparent in the conscious Marine. Under hypnosis, this Jones had been carefully coached by suggestion. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, was a loyal American, and was \"imprinted\" to say nothing during conscious phases. **All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.** It worked beautifully for months with this subject, but the technique", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:estabrooks_hypnosis.txt:1:1701a4265af0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9665, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "estabrooks_hypnosis.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "estabrooks_hypnosis", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in the conscious Marine.

While there was no way for an enemy to expose Jones' dual personality, they suspected it and played the same trick on us later. The use of \"waking hypnosis\" in counter intelligence during World War II occasionally became so involved that it taxed even my credulity. Among the most complicated ploys used was the practice of sending perfectly normal, wide awake agent into enemy camp, after he'd been carefully coached in waking hypnosis to \"act\" the part of a potential hypnotism subject. Trained in auto-suggestion, or self-hypnosis, such a subject can pass every test used to spot a hypnotized person. Using it, he can control the rate of his heartbeat, anesthetize himself to a degree against pain of electric shock or torture. In the case of an officer we'll call Cox, this carefully prepared counterspy was given a title to indicate he had access to top priority information. He was planted in an international cafe in a border country where it was certain there would be enemy agents. He talked too much, drank a lot, made friends with local girls, and pretended a childish interest in hypnotism. The hope was that he would blunder into a situation where enemy agents would kidnap him and try to hypnotize him, in order to extract information from him. Cox worked so well that they fell for the trick. He never allowed himself to be hypnotized during seances. While pretending to be a hypnotized subject of the foe, he was gathering and feeding back information. Eventually, Cox did get caught, when he was followed to an information \"drop.\" And this international group plays rough. The enemy offered him a \"ride\" at gunpoint. There were four men in the vehicle. Cox watched for a chance, and found it when the car skirted a ravine. He leaped for the wheel, twisted it, and over the edge they went. Two of his guards were killed in the crash. In the ensuing scramble, he got hold of another man's gun, liquidated the remaining two, then hobbled across the border with nothing worse than a broken leg. G.H.

One of the world's foremost proponents of new energy was killed on May 14, 2004. Dr. Eugene Mallove was the founder and editor of the magazine *Infinite Energy* to which I have enjoyed subscribing. The magazine provides a wealth of excellent, scholarly discussions of new energy theories and devices. We recommend it on our Resource List at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#newenergy). Dr. Mallove also worked at MIT where he uncovered serious manipulation of data on the cold fusion experiments there in 1989. This led him to resign his position at MIT over 10 years ago and begin researching the truth behind cold fusion and other new energy discoveries, and eventually led to his publishing the first issue of *Infinite Energy *in 1995. In regards to this, he was one of the witnesses for Disclosure Project. Below is his quote which we list on our UFO cover-up summary at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mallove): ** MIT Chief Science Writer, Dr. Eugene Mallove** I was the Chief Science Writer at the MIT news office when the cold fusion story out of Utah broke on March 23, 1989. It turns out the cold fusion effect was real. In fact, what Pons and Fleischmann found was only the tip of an iceberg. There are huge quantities of technical literature published by proponents, and a much smaller amount by the people who found so-called negative results....One day while at MIT, I inadvertently was looking through some piles of paper by physicists doing their repeat of the Pons-Fleischmann experiment. To my utter astonishment, I can remember sitting at my desk and actually seeing two sheets of paper, one dated July 10 and another July 13. The July 10 control experiment showed in the raw data excess heat. But then, on July 13, it was shifted completely. It was altered. Clear fraud-no question. I asked for a review at MIT. I got nowhere. Yet today, MIT data is held up. There has been an extraordinary abrogation of legal responsibility at the Patent Office and the Department of Energy on the matter of cold fusion. There is serious criminal activity going on that ultimately must be rooted out if the cold fusion and new energy revolution are to go forward.** pp. 544-546.

It is considered by the police to be a homicide and an investigation is underway. Gene is survived by his wife Joanne, son Ethan and daughter Kim. No funeral arrangements are known at this time. Gene Mallove, who, in his 1991 book \"Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth behind the Cold Fusion Furor,\" was the first to courageously and boldly express the truth behind cold fusion, long before any science journalist even dared to ask questions that challenged the prevailing view. For 15 years, Gene maintained the cold fusion \"torch\" at great personal sacrifice, which initially drew many to learn the truth behind cold fusion. Gene's generosity and commitment to a better world will be forever appreciated.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) after the panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, officially known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, complained that the FAA had been less than forthcoming in turning over documents and issued a subpoena to the agency for more information. The FAA said it was cooperating fully with the 9/11 panel. **The agency said it took disciplinary action against the employee who destroyed the tape but declined to elaborate on what kind of action they took.** [Earlier, an FAA official incorrectly stated that the agency took action against two employees in the case.] \"We believe the audiotape in question appears to be consistent with written statements and other materials provided to FBI investigators and would not have added in any significant way to the information contained in what has already been provided to investigators and members of the 9/11 commission,\" said FAA spokesman Greg Martin. Hours after the hijacked planes flew into the World Trade Center Towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, an FAA manager at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center gathered six controllers who communicated or tracked two of the hijacked planes and recorded in a one-hour interview their personal accounts of what occurred, the report stated. The manager, who is not named in the report, said that his intentions were to provide quick information to federal officials investigating the attack before the air traffic controllers involved took sick leave for the stress of their experiences, as is common practice. According to the report, a second manager at the New York center promised a union official representing the controllers that he would \"get rid of\" the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:faadestroyed911tape.txt:0:1b89100f8f10", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9670, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "faadestroyed911tape.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "faadestroyed911tape", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "one-hour interview their personal accounts of what occurred, the report stated.

According to the report, a second manager at the New York center promised a union official representing the controllers that he would \"get rid of\" the tape after controllers used it to provide written statements to federal officials about the events of the day. Instead, the second manager said he destroyed the tape between December 2001 and January 2002 by crushing the tape with his hand, cutting it into small pieces and depositing the pieces into trash cans around the building, the report said. **The tape's existence was never made known to federal officials investigating the attack, nor to FAA officials in Washington.** Staff members of the 9/11 panel found out about the tape during interviews with some controllers who participated in the recording. One controller said she asked to listen to the tape in order to prepare her written account of her experience, but one of the managers denied her request. The New York managers acknowledged that they received an e-mail from FAA officials instructing them to retain all materials related to the Sept. 11 attacks. \"If a question arises whether or not you should retain the data, RETAIN IT,\" the report quoted the e-mail as saying. But the managers decided not to include the tape in a November 2001 \"Formal Accident Package\" report the office prepared because one manager said he did not want to break his word to the union official and he did not think the tape should ever have been made. The inspector general concluded today that the managers' actions resulted in the loss of potential evidence that would allow the 9/11 commission to compare controllers' recollection of the events immediately after the attacks with the written statements prepared three weeks later. \"The destruction of evidence in the Government's possession, in this case an audiotape -- particularly during times of national crisis -- has the effect of fostering an appearance that information is being withheld from the public.\" © 2004 The Washington Post Company **Note: The original article is [available here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/05/07/controllers-911-tape-destroyed-report-says/750cf564-6504-44df-b014-18c8dfcc1948/).

Mark Dayton, D-Minn., charged Friday that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) have covered up \"catastrophic failures\" that left the nation vulnerable during the Sept. 11 hijackings. \"For almost three years now, NORAD officials and FAA officials have been able to hide their critical failures that left this country defenseless during two of the worst hours in our history,\" Dayton declared during a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. (several paragraphs omitted) **Dayton: 'NORAD lied'** During the hearing, Dayton told leaders of the Sept. 11 commission, that, based on the commission's report, a NORAD chronology made public a week after the attacks was grossly misleading. The chronology said the FAA notified the military's emergency air command of three of the hijackings while those jetliners were still airborne. Dayton cited commission findings that the FAA failed to inform NORAD about three of the planes until after they had crashed. And, he said, a squadron of NORAD fighter planes that was scrambled was sent east over the Atlantic Ocean and was 150 miles from Washington, D.C., when the third plane struck the Pentagon -- \"farther than they were before they took off.\" Dayton said NORAD officials \"lied to the American people, they lied to Congress and they lied to your 9/11 commission to create a false impression of competence, communication and protection of the American people.\" He told Kean and Hamilton that if the commission's report is correct, President Bush \"should fire whoever at FAA, at NORAD ... betrayed their public trust by not telling us the truth.\" Asked about Dayton's allegation, a spokesman for Colorado Springs-based NORAD said, \"We stand on our testimony to the commission\" and declined to discuss the 2001 chronology. Erin Utzinger, a spokeswoman for Dayton, said the senator \"assumes the FAA knew of NORAD's coverup.\" FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said the agency \"has never and would never intentionally misrepresent or alter information. We worked very closely with the 9/11 commission and provided them with everything that was available to us.\" Dayton told reporters that he skipped festivities at the Democratic National Committee Tuesday night and sat in his hotel room until 2:30 a.m. reading the commission report. After piecing together the section about the FAA and NORAD, he said, he could not fall asleep. **Dayton outraged** \"I'm a strong defender of government,\" he said. \"When", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:faanoradaccused.txt:0:97f1dff9a819", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9673, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "faanoradaccused.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "faanoradaccused", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "would never intentionally misrepresent or alter information.

After piecing together the section about the FAA and NORAD, he said, he could not fall asleep. **Dayton outraged** \"I'm a strong defender of government,\" he said. \"When government fails, it really outrages me. It just destroys peoples' trust and faith.\" Using the chronology, Dayton argued that if the FAA had promptly sent a systemwide message about the hijackings, the pilot of the fourth plane seized, United Airlines Flight 93, might have been able to secure the cockpit doors and land the plane. Passengers, including Minnesota native Tom Burnett, Jr., \"could very well be alive,\" he said. \"This is unbelievable negligence,\" Dayton said. \"It doesn't matter if we spend $550 billion annually on our national defense, if we reorganize our intelligence or if we restructure congressional oversight if people don't pick up the phone to call one another.\" He also noted that NORAD could not find the hijacked jetliners because terrorists turned off their transponders and NORAD lacked adequate radar to locate them without that beamed signal. Dayton said NORAD also falsely claimed that during the hijackings, it had F-16 Combat Air Patrol planes in place at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and an AWAC command ship in the air to protect the nation's capital. Dayton, a former Minnesota state auditor, called the FAA's and NORAD's failures \"the most gross incompetence and dereliction of responsibility and negligence that I've ever, under those extreme circumstances, witnessed in the public sector.\" ** For a revealing timeline by the Senator, go to: **[http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/4904189.html](http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/4904189.html) In order to see this document, you will have to sign up as a member (no cost).

Mark Dayton reconstructed the Sept. 11 commission report and NORAD's accounts this way:** The FAA did not notify NORAD of the first hijacking of American Airlines Flight 11 for 23 minutes, just nine minutes before the plane slammed into the World Trade Center. NORAD's 2001 chronology said it was notified six minutes before impact. The FAA didn't notify NORAD of the second hijacking until the same minute it hit the second Trade Center tower. NORAD said it was notified nine minutes before impact. It took the FAA air traffic controller 15 minutes to notify the regional FAA center about the third hijacking, and the regional center another 15 minutes to inform FAA headquarters. Yet, even though two planes had hit the Trade Center, the FAA did not let NORAD know about that hijacking until after the plane hit the Pentagon.

Thirteen minutes later, a Command Center official told headquarters, \"Uh, do we want to, uh, think about scrambling aircraft?\" Headquarters replied: Oh, God, I don't know.\" The plane crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03 a.m., before NORAD was notified. -- To subscribe to or unsubscribe from the WantToKnow.info list (one email every few days): [https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe) --", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:faanoradaccused.txt:2:c05bc34a6a94", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9675, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "falseflag.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "falseflag", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "False Flag False Flag Summary of False Flag Operations and False Flag Terrorism **Definition of False Flag** **\"False flag terrorism\" occurs when elements within a government stage a secret operation whereby government forces pretend to be a targeted enemy while attacking their own forces or people. **The attack is then falsely blamed on the enemy in order to justify going to war against that enemy. Or as [Wikipedia defines it](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031171113/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag): False flag operations are [covert operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation) conducted by governments, corporations, or other organizations, which are designed to deceive the public in such a way that the operations appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from the military concept of flying false colors; that is, flying the flag of a country other than one's own. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations, and have been used in peace-time; for example, during Italy's [strategy of tension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension). The term comes from the old days of wooden ships, when one ship would hang the flag of its enemy before attacking another ship in its own navy. Because the enemy's flag was hung instead of the flag of the real country of the attacking ship, it was called a \"false flag\" attack. **9/11 Note:** For those wanting to explore the possibility of 9/11 as a false flag operation, [click here](#911). **Historical False Flag Attacks** There are many examples of false flag attacks throughout history. For example, it is widely known that the Nazis, [in Operation Himmler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler), faked attacks on their own people and resources which they blamed on the Poles, to justify the invasion of Poland. **And it has now been persuasively argued - as shown, for example, in [this History Channel video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Sj5NqV6rQ) - that Nazis set fire to their own parliament, the Reichstag, and blamed that fire on others. **The Reichstag fire was the watershed event which justified Hitler's seizure of power and suspension of liberties. And in the early 1950s, agents of an Israeli terrorist cell operating in Egypt [planted bombs in several buildings](http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-1/text/beinin.html), including U.S. diplomatic facilities, then left behind \"evidence\" implicating the Arabs as the culprits (one of the bombs detonated prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers). Israel's Defense Minister was brought down by the scandal, along with the entire Israeli government. [Click here](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/lavon.html) for verification. **The Russian KGB apparently conducted [a wave of bombings](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1456763/Secret-at-the-heart-of-Putin%27s-rise-to-power.html) in Russia in order to justify war against Chechnya and put Vladimir Putin into power** (see also [this essay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Apartment_Bombings) and [this report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/documents/false_flag_russia_bombings.pdf)). And the Turkish government has been caught [bombing its own](https://www.WantToKnow.info/documents/false_flag_turkey.htm) and blaming it on a rebel group to justify a crackdown on that group. Muslim governments also play this game. For example, the well-respected former Indonesian president claimed that their government [had a role in the Bali bombings](http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Possible-police-role-in-2002-Bali-attack/2005/10/12/1128796591857.html).

This sounds nuts, right? You've never heard of this \"false flag terrorism,\" where a government attacks its own people then blames others in order to justify its goals, right? And you are skeptical of the statements discussed above? Please take a look at these historical quotes: \"If tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.\" - U.S. President [James Madison](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/jamesmadis169357.html) \"Why of course the people don't want war ... But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship ... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.\" - [Hermann Goering](http://www.famousquotes.com/search.php?search=%22denounce+the+pacifists), Nazi leader. **What about the U.S.?** Is it logical to assume that, even if other countries have carried out false flag operations (especially horrible regimes such as, say, the Nazis or Stalin), the U.S. has never done so? Well, as documented by the *New York Times*, [Iranians working for the C.I.A.](http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html) in the 1950's posed as Communists and staged bombings in Iran in order to turn the country against its democratically-elected president (see also [this essay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ajax)). And, as confirmed by a former Italian Prime Minister, an Italian judge, and the [former head of Italian counterintelligence](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,462976,00.html), NATO [carried out terror bombings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension) in Italy with the help of the Pentagon and CIA and blamed communists in order to rally people's support for their governments in Europe in their fight against communism.

Did you know that years after 9/11 the FBI first stated that [it did not have sufficient evidence](http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47109,00.html) to prosecute Bin Laden for 9/11?

It is also interesting that the only Congress members mailed anthrax letters [were key Democrats](http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/11/21/anthrax/index_np.html), and that the attacks occurred one week before passage of the freedom-curtailing PATRIOT Act, which seems to have scared them and the rest of Congress into passing that act without even reading it. And though it may be a coincidence, White House staff [began taking the anti-anthrax medicine](http://www.judicialwatch.org/2953.shtml) before the Anthrax attacks occurred. Even General William Odom, [former director](http://hammernews.com/odomspeech.htm) of the National Security Agency, said \"By any measure the US has long used terrorism. In '78-79 the Senate was trying to pass a law against international terrorism, yet in every version they produced, the lawyers said the US would be in violation\" (the audio is [here](http://hammernews.com/odom.ram)). **Why Does This Matter?** Please read what the following highly respected people are saying: **Former prominent Republican U.S. Congressman and CIA official Bob Barr stated that the U.S. is close to [becoming a totalitarian society](http://prisonplanet.com/articles/december2005/111205totalitariandanger.htm) and that elements in government are using fear to try to bring this about. ** Republican U.S. Congressman Ron Paul stated that the government \"[is determined to have martial law](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/october2005/121005slamsbush.htm).\" He also said a contrived \"[Gulf of Tonkin-type incident](http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2007/cr011107.htm) may occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran.\" **Former National Security Adviser Brzezinski told the Senate that a terrorist act might be carried out in the U.S. and [falsely blamed on Iran](https://www.WantToKnow.info/documents/false_flag_blame_iran.htm) to justify yet another war.** The former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration, [Paul Craig Roberts](http://www.vdare.com/roberts/bio.htm), who is called the \"Father of Reaganomics\" and is a former editor and columnist for the *Wall Street Journal*, *BusinessWeek*, and Scripps Howard News Service, [has said](http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts07162007.html): \"Ask yourself: Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging 'terrorist' attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda?\" Retired 27-year CIA analyst Ray McGovern, who prepared and presented Presidential Daily Briefs and served as a high-level analyst for several presidents, stated that if there was [another major attack](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/october2005/191005McGovern.htm) in the U.S., it would lead to martial law.

General Tommy Franks stated that if another terrorist attack occurs in the United States \"[the Constitution will likely be discarded](http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/11/20/185048.shtml) in favor of a military form of government.\" Former UN Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter stated before the Iraq war started that there were no weapons of mass destruction.

We were told to believe that January 6 was a violent insurrection aimed at overthrowing legitimate government and [staging a coup](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/11/capitol-riot-self-coup-trump-fiona-hill-457549). The events of that day received extensive media coverage, with a group called the Proud Boys held largely responsible for organizing the rebellion. But it was barely reported that the leader of the Proud Boys, [Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-proud-boys-leader-was-prolific-informant-the-fbi-report-says). In fact, the FBI had as many as [eight informants](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-reportedly-had-eight-informants-153404947.html) within the Proud Boys during the Capitol storming. Yet as *New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6-trial-bertino.html), \"despite the vast amount of evidence the government collected in the case - including more than 500,000 encrypted text messages - investigators never found a smoking gun that conclusively showed the Proud Boys plotted to help President Donald J. Trump remain in office.\" The FBI found \"[scant evidence](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-fbi-finds-scant-evidence-us-capitol-attack-was-coordinated-sources-2021-08-20/)\" that there was an organized plot to overturn the presidential election result. In fact, a senior law enforcement official emphasized that the majority of those arrested acted independently, driven more by personal grievances against the political establishment than by any coordinated effort to undermine the electoral process. *There is little that unites me with those who occupied the Capitol building on Jan. 6. But that does not mean I support the judicial lynching against many of those who participated in the Jan. 6 events, a lynching that is mandating years in pretrial detention and prison for misdemeanors. Once rights become privileges, none of us are safe. The vast majority of those caught up in the incursion of the Capitol did not commit serious crimes, engage in violence or know what they would do in Washington other than protest the election results. We are exacerbating the growing tribalism and political antagonisms that will increasingly express themselves through violence. We are complicit, once again, of using the courts to carry out vendettas. **We are corroding democratic institutions. We are hardening the ideology and rage of the far-right.*** - Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges Chris Hedges, [Lynching the Deplorables](https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/lynching-the-deplorables) While the Oklahoma City bombing led to far greater loss of life than the events on January 6, both incidents share a troubling similarity: the involvement of the FBI with the perpetrators.

Prosecuting innocent teenagers like this not only pads the FBI's arrest and prosecution statistics but also helps justify its budget by misrepresenting the threat of terrorism. National security expert Sahar Aziz reflects on the nature of the FBI's tactics, saying, \"If there were genuine terrorist threats in America, the FBI wouldn't be diverting its resources to ensnaring a mentally ill minor.\" **A Call to Rise Above Fear and Polarization-Regardless of Who's Elected** *I want there to be a place in the world where people can engage in one another's differences in a way that is redemptive, full of hope and possibility. **Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination.** The ability to acknowledge blind spots can emerge only as we expand our capacity to care about the oppression and exploitation of others. A love ethic makes this expansion possible.* - poet and social justice activist bell hooks Far-right, white supremacist extremism is a legitimate threat, and we need to find ways to heal the cycle of violence and hate in our communities. For example, Black musician Daryl Davis [befriended hundreds of KKK and white supremacists with love and acceptance](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-im-black-musician-who-has-befriended-encouraged-over-200-ku-klux-klan-members-give-up-their-robes), leading these individuals to disavow their allegiances and thus unravel generations of hate. The work of Smith college professor Loretta Ross provides a [constructive alternative to the dehumanizing cancel culture](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-what-if-instead-calling-people-out-we-called-them-) widespread in our society. As a social justice activist, she lived through [COINTELPRO](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ia/cointelpro-fbi), a secret FBI program that sought to destroy lives, ruin reputations, and disrupt socially progressive organizations that challenged establishment interests. Over the years, she's built unexpected yet transformative relationships with KKK members and incarcerated men convicted of serious crimes against women. In response to the growing polarization in our society, she once said **\"if you're more wedded to destabilizing than unifying, part of me is gonna think you're naive, and the other part of me is gonna think you're a plant. And neither one of those is going to look good on you.\"** She lives by a motto that was shared with her by her mentor Reverend C. T.

Vivian: **\"When you ask people to give up hate, you have to be there for them when they do.\"** **Perhaps a greater threat to society is the misrepresentation of extremism to make people afraid and easier to manipulate. Who benefits from creating mass fear in the public about right-wing extremism?** Politicians and government agencies consolidating their power, the national security and surveillance state profitably expanding its reach, and corporate media capitalizing on strong emotions. After all, the fear of Communism benefitted Adolf Hitler, and [made people more willing](https://www.yesmagazine.org/issue/science/2017/02/16/how-norway-avoided-becoming-a-fascist-state) to conform to harsh militant rule and turn a blind eye to genocide. The fear of terrorism following 9/11 benefitted war profiteers, despite a failed 20-year war that costed [$8 trillion](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar) and [killed 4.5 million people](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-time-reassess-war-terror). Here's the good news. [Humanity is more peaceful than ever before](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/voices/why-are-we-blind-human-progress-and-development-harvards-steven-pinker-has-explanation) compared to past centuries. More and more people find less and less value in the two-party system, which is driving a shift towards alternative viewpoints that transcend the tribalistic partisan polarization flooding our media systems and poisoning our conversations. In fact, a [recent poll](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat) revealed that a record 49% of Americans see themselves as politically independent - the same percentage as the two major parties put together. **Regardless of who's elected in office, the biggest challenges we face will persist, far outweighing the threat of far-right terrorism.** If we really wanted to protect the American people, we could save millions of lives by dismantling the [corporate cartels controlling our food and healthcare systems](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/historic-senate-panel-exposes-how). We could also hold our intelligence agencies accountable for their longstanding history of funding and supporting repressive far-right regimes all over the world. Perhaps most importantly, we could begin addressing the predatory corporate practices and government policies responsible for the extreme levels of financial inequality holding our entire society back. Labels like \"election deniers,\" \"far-right white supremacists,\" and \"conspiracy theorists\" reduce us to ideological constructs, sabotaging authentic communication by stripping away context and nuance. The end result is that we've become more counter aggressive, defensive, and fearful of each other. No matter who we vote for, each of us has the responsibility to work with our fears in the face of complex issues that lack clear answers. Destabilization, chaos, and polarization may provoke deeper questions that could help us turn to one another-across our echo chambers and political differences. It seems as though any societal shift begins with a [consciousness shift](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/healing-the-culture-warsone-conscious) in how we think and relate to ourselves, others, and the world.

Our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was fine to play with pans. When we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent 'clackers' on our wheels. As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the passenger seat was a treat. We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle - tasted the same. We ate dripping sandwiches, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no one actually died from this. We would spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into stinging nettles a few times, we learned to solve the problem. We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was able to reach us all day and no-one minded. We did not have Playstations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, no Internet chat rooms. We had friends, we went outside and found them. We played elastics and street rounders, and sometimes that ball really hurt. We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits. They were accidents. We learnt not to do the same thing again. We had fights, punched each other hard and got black and blue - we learned to get over it. We walked to friend's homes. We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate live stuff, and although we were told it would happen, we did not have very many eyes out, nor did the live stuff live inside us forever. We rode bikes in packs of 7 and wore our coats by only the hood. Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine that! This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:fearrunsrampant.txt:0:bb0aef110cbd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9688, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "fearrunsrampant.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "fearrunsrampant", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "coats by only the hood.

In a small black circle on the left side of these notes, you will also see the words \"Federal Reserve.\" It is the Federal Reserve which issues all bank notes in the United States. To see just how much control the Federal Reserve has over the issuance of U.S. currency, see their webpage at [this link](http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section16.htm). Yet who owns the Federal Reserve? Though the [Board of Governors](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri.htm) of the Federal Reserve is categorized as an independent government agency, \"The Fed\" is not owned by the government. The Supreme Court stated that \"instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest.\" You can verify this by reading the court case at [this link](http://openjurist.org/406/f3d/532/scott-v-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-city) (case 406 F.3d 532) and going to Part II, paragraph 9. This case further states that \"each Federal Reserve Bank is owned by the commercial banks within its district.\" It's quite revealing that though the official website of the Federal Reserve contains a [detailed description of the Federal Reserve](http://federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_1.pdf) that is over 20 pages in length, ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks is never even mentioned. Could it be that this information is conveniently withheld to keep the public from understanding who owns the banks which issue all U.S. dollars? **Though Federal Reserve Board members are appointed by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate, the Federal Reserve is a privately owned institution controlled mainly by large private banks.** Once board members are appointed, the U.S. government has no control over", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:financialbankingcoverup.txt:0:ff63fa070ee7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9692, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "financialbankingcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "financialbankingcoverup", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "20 pages in length, ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks is never even mentioned.

Yet a study of [the history and functions](https://web.archive.org/web/20120414062039/https://www.monetary.org/is-the-federal-reserve-system-a-governmental-or-a-privately-controlled-organization/2008/02/) of the Federal Reserve reveals that powerful bankers such as J.P. Morgan have had inordinate power and control over the formation and management of the monetary policy of the United States through their power over the Fed. **Congress has virtually no influence over this incredibly powerful institution.** Neither does the Fed have reserves to back all of the credit it issues. None of the money in circulation is backed by anything of real value such as gold or silver. The backing of U.S. currency by a [gold standard was removed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) under President Nixon in 1971. In fact, the Fed, like all banks, at any one time has only 3 to 10% of all credit issued held in reserve as bank notes. So the Federal Reserve is neither truly federal, nor a full reserve. It is not owned or directly controlled by the United States government. The fact that the words \"United States Federal Reserve System\" are printed on every U.S. bank note thus raises serious questions. **The foundation for the Federal Reserve system was crafted in the utmost secrecy in 1910 at the [Jekyll Island resort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island#Planning_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) by several powerful men with very close ties to the [Rockefellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefellers), the [J.P. Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P.Morgan) family, and the [Rothschilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschilds)** - the richest and most powerful families in the world at that time. A version of the legislation crafted eventually passed in 1913 over the objections of many who feared that turning over control of the nation's money supply to a consortium of private bankers would inevitably only produce more riches for the ultra rich at the expense of the general public. Virtually everyone agrees that the Fed is highly secretive. [Wikipedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023024539/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve#Criticisms) lists other criticisms of the Federal Reserve in the below three paragraphs: \"A large and varied group of criticisms have been directed against the Federal Reserve System.

[[13]](http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/97/970910greenspan.html). Ben Bernanke, [former] Chairman of the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve, stated: 'I would like to say to Milton [Friedman] and Anna [J. Schwartz]: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.'** [[22]](http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm) [[23]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/28/AR2005102802426_2.html)\" **The Fractional Reserve System: Creating Money Out of Thin Air ** Another aspect of banking about which most people know little to nothing is the fractional reserve system. [Fractional-reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking) refers to the standard banking practice of issuing more money than the bank holds as reserves. Banks in modern economies typically lend their customers *many times* the sum of the cash reserves that they hold. **Did you know that for every dollar in your checking or savings account, the bank can legally lend out $10 or more?** Here's a description of fraction reserve banking's origins from a standard university macroeconomics text [[1](#1)]: \"When the ancients began to use gold in making transactions, it became apparent that it was both unsafe and inconvenient for consumers and merchants to carry gold and have it weighed and assessed for purity every time a transaction was negotiated. It therefore became commonplace to deposit one's gold with goldsmiths whose vaults or strongrooms could be used for a fee. Upon receiving a gold deposit, the goldsmith issued a receipt to the depositor. Soon goods were traded for the goldsmiths' receipts and the receipts became the first kind of paper money. \"At this point the goldsmiths - embryonic bankers - used a 100% reserve system; their circulating paper money receipts were fully backed by gold. But, given the public's acceptance of the goldsmiths' receipts as paper money, the goldsmiths became aware that the gold they stored was rarely redeemed. Then some adroit banker hit on the idea that paper money could be issued *in excess of* the amount of gold held. Goldsmiths [then began to issue]", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:financialbankingcoverup.txt:2:1fd3d30d7a60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9694, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "financialbankingcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "financialbankingcoverup", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "first kind of paper money. \"At this point the goldsmiths - embryonic bankers - used a 100% reserve system; their circulating paper money receipts were fully backed by gold. But, given the public's acceptance of the goldsmiths' receipts as paper money, the goldsmiths became aware that the gold they stored was rarely redeemed. Then some adroit banker hit on the idea that paper money could be issued *in excess of* the amount of gold held. Goldsmiths [then began to issue] additional 'receipts' ... into circulation by making interest-earning loans in the form of gold receipts. This was the beginning of the *fractional reserve system* of banking.\" **The college text from which the above quote is taken does not question the propriety of goldsmiths creating these new \"receipts\" or money without any gold backing, without any authority, and indeed without any real reason to do so other than to enrich themselves. In fact, the text even praises the questionable behavior of the one who began this hidden form of corruption as \"adroit.\"** The unsuspecting public had no idea that goldsmiths were issuing paper receipts accepted as money which were backed by no gold deposits at all for ten times or more the amount of gold that had been entrusted to them. The goldsmiths were secretly creating money out of thin air. They thus made themselves fantastically wealthy without anyone noticing what was going on. To better hide this deceit and divert people's attention, the goldsmiths stopped their old practice of charging for storing gold and instead began to pay customers a small interest on their gold deposits to keep them happy. Thus it was that modern day bankers were born. Amazingly, the system has changed little today. Macroeconomics professors, college texts, and all involved with banking almost never question the ethics or morality of this fractional reserve system. No one even questions in any meaningful way the ethics and corruption involved in creating money out of thin air. In fact, the fractional reserve system was formalized into law centuries ago and continues to be both legal and the accepted common practice around the world today. Have you ever wondered how banks afford those massive buildings downtown if they charge only 10% or so on loans and pay 5% or less interest on deposits? If bankers were not allowed to create money out of thin air, they would be making only a few percent a year on every loan issued, far from enough to build the towering skyscrapers owned by banks in practically every major city. But **by creating credit (money) using the fractional reserve system, bankers can legally claim credit to 10 times or more the amount of any loan. **Now you can understand the foundation upon which global banking empires are built.

We do, however, feel that suppressing and otherwise hiding this key information is a massive deception which does not serve the public and only serves to allow the bankers to easily become excessively powerful and corrupt. **We recommend these revealing documentaries on money and the banking cover-up:** [https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/monopoly_men](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/monopoly_men) - Monopoly Men (45 min.)

Next day a plane crashed in Moscow. CNN told about a fireball that was reported from Bakersfield California, to Medford Oregon. They said it occurred about 6 or 6:15 in the morning on Saturday, September 10 (1994) and was so bright that the light shining through windows woke up some people. They showed a house in San Rafael with a hole in the roof from a piece of something falling from the sky. An Ariane rocket was launched from French Guyana and was lost, a day before. Several earthquakes have occurred in California, including one that CNN showed on a map, southwest of Lake Tahoe. About 15 minutes later, CNN began telling about the Space Shuttle firing lasers at Earth and showed a view of Earth, with Lake Tahoe in the upper right corner of the screen. If you put the two together, then you see that the Columbia Space Shuttle is firing laser beams at Earth \"for environmental purposes,\" precisely where the earthquakes are occurring. The President went to Camp David , then when the President returned (?), a plane crashed into the White House. Later he gave a speech in a room of the White House, then just after he left a fire broke out in the room. Rosh Hashanah is recently passed (September 6-7, 1994), and Yom Kippur is coming up (September 15, 1994). The President has ordered 8,300 Navy, 1,800 Marine and 4,000 Army personnel along with 15 or 20 warships to [prepare to] invade Haiti.

SECRET WARS BETWEEN POWERS THAT BE If what you are about to read does not scare the pants off you, then you must not be wearing any. Pay attention and this information may save your life. The purpose of this article is to inform you briefly about some of the secret wars that are going on between the Powers-That-Be that are struggling for control of the world. In 1978, I was head of a Mensa special interest group called the Doomsday Club News and Intelligence Report. I wrote a newsletter for the Club. In the May, 1978, issue I said: \"WAR is an ever-present danger, much closer than most people realize. Now Russia is testing 'killer satellites' and laser and particle beam weapons, while the U.S. is undertaking a major program to develop counterbeam weapons - a real Star Wars battle is taking shape. War in space is now possible and the likelihood of it grows. A program is now under way to determine the feasibility of using the Space Shuttle for defense purposes.\" What I did not know at that time, was the fact that the space war had already started. This manuscript will provide more details. In the same newsletter, I mentioned that Richard Helms of the CIA had been fired by President Carter, and recommended that the reader contact the Security & Intelligence Fund (at address included) for more information. I listed the staff members a s James Angleton, Elbridge Durbrow, Brig Gen. Robert Richardson, Former Secy. of Navy and Treasury Robert Anderson, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral G. W. Anderson, and other names that become important later in this story. SHIFTING DEFENSE STRATEGIES On page 10, I said: \"The U.S. is shifting its defense to sub-launched ballistics missiles and air-launched cruise missiles, as silo-based ICBMs become vulnerable to a pre-emptive first strike by the Soviet Union.\" The B-52, F-14, F-15, and F-16 will be equipped with cruise missiles over the next five years, in the Pacific Region. This posture indicates admission that nothing standing still in the U.S. can be protected - only aircraft and submarines have a chance of surviving a first strike. \"Independent congressional studies already have been completed that show that by 1980 the Russians could conduct a first strike against the Minuteman force with a strong probability of being able to destroy the majority of U.S. ICBMs, and that by as early as 1981 the U.S. will no longer have a sufficient deterrent to preclude a Soviet first strike.\" I continued with a quote from Aviation Week & Space Technology, (p. 14, Apr. 3, 1978), about the numbers of missiles that we and Russia had.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:1:817b627454e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9701, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "been completed that show that by 1980 the Russians could conduct a first strike against the Minuteman force with a strong probability of being able to destroy the majority of U.S. ICBMs, and that by as early as 1981 the U.S. will no longer have a sufficient deterrent to preclude a Soviet first strike.\" I continued with a quote from Aviation Week & Space Technology, (p. 14, Apr. 3, 1978), about the numbers of missiles that we and Russia had. Later on the page I mentioned about Defense Secretary Harold Brown proposing a sharp increase in civil defense spending, including funding a study to plan faster evacuation of cities during threat of a nuclear attack. What was going on? Why was the U.S. shifting its defense strategy, and suddenly emphasizing the importance of civil defense? In my July issue of the DCN&IR newsletter, I quoted General George S. Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said: \"What the Soviets are doing is unsettling, principally because none of us know why.\" I said: \"General Alexander Haig, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , warned Washington in March of the fundamental change in the Warsaw Pact Air Arm to \"an offensive character.\" I continued by saying that I felt that Russia was preparing to defend itself from the threat of a rearmed Germany. I mentioned that most of the U.S. nuclear force was on German soil. On page 7 I said that \" Japan , for the first time since World War II, has ordered its armed forces to prepare defense plans to protect itself from foreign attack.\" On page 10, I quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn as saying, \"No weapons, no matter how powerful, can help the West until it overcomes its loss of willpower. To defend oneself, one must be ready to die.\" PARTICLE BEAM TECHNOLOGY RIDICULED Th cover headline article of my October 1978 issue was NUCLEAR WEAPONS - SOON OBSOLETE! The following is what that article said: General George Keegan - grad of Harvard, flew 56 combat missions in WWII, earned Distinguished Service Cross in Vietnam , Executive VP of U.S. Strategic Institute, Chief of U.S. Air Force Intelligence. About two years ago he retired from the Air Force, because he saw some critical dangers to the U.S. that he was not allowed to reveal to the public. He tried to warn the Powers in the White House but they laughed at him. So about 19 months ago he made the first public references to secret Russian research on *charged-particle beam weapons.* Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine followed up on his information and determined that he was essentially correct. However, President Carter and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, both badly briefed by the CIA, ridiculed Keegan. U.S. scientists at Lawrence Livermore Lab (bicycle riding distance from me) undertook Project See-Saw to determine if the U.S. could build particle beam", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:2:8998db789414", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9702, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "they laughed at him.

However, President Carter and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, both badly briefed by the CIA, ridiculed Keegan. U.S. scientists at Lawrence Livermore Lab (bicycle riding distance from me) undertook Project See-Saw to determine if the U.S. could build particle beam weapons. The decision was that it was presently impossible to build such a weapon and since we are so far ahead of the Soviets technologically, it was ridiculous to think they were building one. Keegan revealed his findings on Soviet particle beam developments to CIA head William Colby in 1975. Colby convened the Nuclear Intelligence Panel which determined that, since the US could not build such a weapon, it was impossible that the Soviets were doing it. Colby never passed the information from the Air Force intelligence on to the President or Secretary of Defense. Keegan retired and started making the information public, through the American Security Council (of which I am a member of the National Advisory Board) and other groups. His story was greeted with high-level official sneering, the most acrimonious sneers coming from the self-styled \"nuclear engineer\" President Jimmy Carter and Defense Secretary Harold Brown (formerly from Lawrence Livermore Lab). \"But despite the official denials, the Soviets continued their work, carrying at least eight electron-beam experiments into space on board Cosmos, Soyuz and Salyut spacecraft...\" (AW & ST) and conducting tests at Semipalatinsk and Sarova. \"At the same time, younger U.S. physicists, uninhibited by the ego problems of their elders, also were making progress on the key techniques required for beam weapons development. Now the tide has turned. A full-scale U.S. effort to tackle the technology required to determine the feasibility of beam weapons development is being organized at the highest level in the Pentagon. Even the most stubborn skeptics now acknowledge that leaving this field uncontested to the Soviets is a risk the U.S. cannot afford to take. Because of the extreme public embarrassment this series [of articles] will bring to... President Jimmy Carter, and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who saw his contemporaries try and fail in Project See-Saw, there is still an attempt to shroud the program in official secrecy\" (Aviation Week & Space Technology, Oct. 2, 1978). The article states, \"Experts on Capitol Hill, who have surveyed all the evidence including secret data not available to us, have concluded that Gen. Keegan's assessment was essentially correct...\" Edward Teller has informed key senators that Gen. Keegan's analysis was right on the core of the matter.\" The Soviets have already successfully tested particle beam weapons (as has France !). \" U.S. particle beam weapons experts who have access to U.S. intelligence information and personal contacts with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:3:7388e8b6467e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9703, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Oct. 2, 1978).

It formerly was mostly a Navy program at the Naval Post-graduate facility in Monterey CA, but is now being combined with the Army SIPAPU project (space beams, as opposed to beams carried on Navy vessels) and others - it seems that now everybody who is anybody is getting involved (Lawrence Livermore Lab, Sandia Corp., Defense Nuclear Agency, CIA, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, University of Texas , Austin Research Associates, etc.). If you remember, Russia beat us into space with Sputnik, then we went into a crash program to get ahead of them. Vannevar Bush once said that it was impossible to build a ballistics missile capable of going 3000 miles, but within 10 years Russia had them and we were just beginning a crash program to catch up. Now we are once again in a race for strategic superiority, but this time Russia may field their system in 2 years while it appears that we require at least 5 years - but then things can change quickly. A problem we now have is the top leadership - the President and Secretary of Defense - may hold back progress because they do not like to admit their mistake. In the past, there were several intelligence services, all in competition with each other trying to be the most accurate and when one service goofed, the other pointed it out. Now, Carter has unified the intelligence services under Stansfield Turner and all intelligence reports must be through Turner before they get to the Defense Secretary or President from men such as Gen. Keegan, Gen. Singlaub, etc. It also creates the chance that the President can be considerably misinformed or uninformed. This, in the long run, could be an even greater danger to the U.S. than the particle beam weapon! PARTICLE BEAM CAPABILITIES So what is a particle beam weapon? It is similar to a laser, but it is not a laser. Lasers shoot a beam of electromagnetic radiation (light), while particle beam weapons shoot a beam of sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons, ions, etc.). What this means is that NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAY SOON BECOME OBSOLETE. Whoever puts satellites with particle beam weapons into orbit first", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:4:c5b067b43425", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9704, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "run, could be an even greater danger to the U.S. than the particle beam weapon!

Lasers shoot a beam of electromagnetic radiation (light), while particle beam weapons shoot a beam of sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons, ions, etc.). What this means is that NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAY SOON BECOME OBSOLETE. Whoever puts satellites with particle beam weapons into orbit first (property controlled by complex sensors and computers) can control the world. ANY GUIDED MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT CAN THEN BE ZAPPED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND AFTER LAUNCH. Under those conditions, we will still have nuclear bombs, but it would be impossible to deliver them against an enemy who is protected by particle beams. An editorial in AW & ST said, \"For beam weapons offer the promise of reducing strategic nuclear weapons to a negligible factor in the future. If successfully deployed, beam weapons can end the long reign of nuclear terror introduced by the ballistic missile and its thermonuclear warhead. If the Soviets achieve this capability first, it will give them enormous crucial leverage in imposing their political will on the rest of the world. If the U.S. achieves it first, there will be no need for flimsy SALT agreements, and in a dead heat, the citizens of this planet can look forward to a shifting of international tensions from the strategic nuclear area to more conventional and less devastating weapons.\" If you want to know what particle beam weapons are like, just watch \"Star Wars\" or Battlestar Galactica.\" This is the end of the quote from my 1978 newsletter. And now, as Paul Harvey would say, for the rest of the story! Russia launched the Intercosmos 17 octagon space vehicle on September 26, 1977. The *Encyclopedia Brittanica* says its purpose was for \"international scientific research in charged particles and micrometeorites.\" What, a charged particle satellite? Already in space? What did we just read above? \"If the Soviets achieve this capability FIRST, it will give them enormous crucial leverage in imposing their political will on the rest of the world.\" WAR IN SPACE The Battle of the Harvest Moon began on September 17, 1977. Russia began destroying our spy satellites using \"killer satellites.\" On September 27, Russia destroyed our SECRET MOON BASE. On September 29, 1977, Russia launched the Salyut 6 manned space station into orbit. First, let's explore a little background. The book *War In Space* by James Canan, 1982, Harper & Row, p. 153 says: \"High-energy weapons, their perils and their promise, began penetrating the congressional consciousness in the late seventies, and it was Major General George J. Keegan USAF - 'crazy George' to his critic, 'brilliant George' to his admirers - who started it all.

The book *War In Space* by James Canan, 1982, Harper & Row, p. 153 says: \"High-energy weapons, their perils and their promise, began penetrating the congressional consciousness in the late seventies, and it was Major General George J. Keegan USAF - 'crazy George' to his critic, 'brilliant George' to his admirers - who started it all. Keegan undoubtedly harbored one of the very highest IQs ever to grace the military establishment, which is, stereotypes to the contrary, saying quite a lot. Keegan was in Air Force intelligence for many years, and in charge of it, starting in 1972, for five... By the mid-seventies, Keegan's Air Force intelligence empire, as his critics dubbed it, had a population of about 50,000 and was spending nearly $3 billion a year. Keegan had access to HUMINT sources inside Russia and elsewhere, to all the albums of the photorecce satellites and all the tapes of the ELINT satellites.\" P. 155: \"In 1972, a young civilian scientist in the employ of Air Force intelligence had come to Keegan with 'evidence of a Soviet effort to develop one of the greatest strategic weapons of all time - a beam weapon of great, high energy that would be used to destroy ballistic missiles in flight for the ultimate defense of the Soviet Union.' Having spent three years studying nuclear physics at the graduate level, Keegan took it upon himself to team up with that young scientist in the examination of evidence gleaned from unclassified Soviet scientific papers. He concluded that the young man was onto something, and he put his troops to work. With Keegan in direct control, an Air Force intelligence team sifted and collated reports from inside Russia and from satellite photographs and communications intercepts concerning a sprawling complex of buildings, pipes, and what-not at Semipalatinsk in south-central Soviet Asia. What the Soviets had built there - starting with their underground positioning of two huge spheres in the early 1970s - was a facility for the testing of charged-particle beams... a sizable segment of the U.S. scientific community jumped all over Keegan, accusing him of trafficking in paranoia.\" P. 157: \"In 1974, two years after General Keegan began sounding off in top-secret circles about the Russian work at Semipalatinsk , particle beams came back into vogue at the Pentagon. A Defense Department document described what happened: the Navy initiated its \"Chair Heritage' program involving electron beam development [for] 'application to defense of ships against all forms of attack by aircraft and missiles... The Army also began a separate program to demonstrate the production of high-current ion beams.' The first Army program, called 'SIPAPU' (an American Indian word for sacred fire) is controlled by the Ballistic Missile Defense Command at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, and centered at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:6:822873997314", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9706, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Defense Department document described what happened: the Navy initiated its \"Chair Heritage' program involving electron beam development [for] 'application to defense of ships against all forms of attack by aircraft and missiles...

Chair Heritage, transferred to DARPA control in 1980, is being conducted by the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Livermore...\" I trust that some of my readers will take note of that word \"Sipapu.\" SECRET PROJECTS Until mid-1979, I worked for Control Data Corporation in Sunnyvale , California, in the \"skunk works\" division. One of the projects on which I worked was Chair Heritage. For confirmation for researchers, I will provide the following information: My boss was Phil Myers. Program Managers were JM Moore (TIGS, IOS projects), Jack Crawford, JL Smith, CR Shuler, LH Woodward, WA Osborne, and others. Some of the projects were code named STC, RFREDA, BRONCO, MARE ISLAND , A4, LATFAC, DALFAC, RKYDSO, etc. It would do you no good to know what these names stood for - TIGS stood for Terminal Integrated Graphics, IOS was Integrated Operating Systems, DALFAC was Dallas Facility, etc. Just suffice to say that we had the world's most powerful computers (Star 100 which was a Cray computer, etc.) and we were involved in the U.S. 's most secret projects. Our customers included the weather facility at Monterey CA, (weather satellites do more than observe the weather), Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), NASA, and, oh yes, THE IRS. One of my friends spent all his free time away from the job studying anti-gravity, so it was not too hard to guess what his job concerned. General Keegan and Carter's Secretary of Defense Harold Brown did not see eye to eye - could the fact that Brown's father was a Russian Jew (I forget his real name) have had anything to do with it? As a military officer, Keegan was forbidden to say anything to the public, so in January 1977 Keegan resigned and set up the civilian American Security Council and began traveling over the country giving speeches to try to awaken everybody. He failed. Keegan died in March, 1993. His obituary in the *New York Times* said, \"He asserted that the Soviet Union was building a civil-defense system that would ensure a reasonable rate of survival from nuclear exchange. He also believed that the Russians were close to deploying futuristic charged particle-beam weapons.\" The book *Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security* by William E. Burrows, Random House, a history of spy satellites, has more information on Keegan.

Burrows, Random House, a history of spy satellites, has more information on Keegan. SKYLAB MISSIONS Have you ever REALLY wondered why the U.S. never went to the moon again? Do you remember *Skylab?* The official story is *Skylab* was launched May 14, 1973. It was to be America 's manned space station. On 5/25/73 a Saturn rocket carried the first crew (Conrad, Kerwin & Weitz) to *Skylab,* a mission that lasted nearly a month. The second crew (Alan Bean, Owen Garriott, and Jack Lousma) was launched 7/28/73, a mission that lasted nearly two months. Both missions were plagued by failures, leaks and other problems. The third manned *Skylab* mission began November 14 with Gerald Carr, William Pogue and Edward Gibson. It was said that the mission was delayed six days because of cracks in the Saturn rocket's tail fins. Russia had launched a space station on April 3, but on April 14 it blew up, what was described as a \"catastrophic malfunction.\" \"BAD LUCK\" AT NASA After the amazing successes of the Apollo missions, for some reason NASA started having all kinds of bad luck. \"In the U.S. the success of the first flight of the Space Shuttle orbiter was clouded by two catastrophic failures of previously reliable rocket launch vehicles. After preliminary taxi test on the runway and flights mated to its Boeing 747 jet carrier plane, the Shuttle orbiter Enterprise was pronounced ready for release from its mother plane. On August 12, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, astronauts Fred W. Haise, Jr., and C. Gordon Fullerton guided the Enterprise to a 'superslick' landing on the floor of Rogers Dry Lake 5 minutes and 23 seconds after being released from the 747. A second flight, with astronauts Joe H. Engle and Richard H. Truly, on September 13 was equally successful. Haise and Fullerton put the Enterprise through yet another landing ten days later. An ill omen appeared at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in mid-May, when a small, strap-on solid-propellant booster rocket fell from its bracket on the first stage of a Delta vehicle and damaged it. The booster was being prepared to launch the Orbital Test Satellite for ESA. The satellite was destroyed on September 13 when its Delta launch vehicle exploded one minute after lift-off, apparently because one of its solid-propellant strap-on rockets detonated. Only 16 days later, a Centaur booster with an Intellsat 4A communications satellite on board also went up in flames only one minute after launch\" (*Encyclopedia Brittanica Book of the Year,* 1978, p.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:8:f84b34ebb11c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9708, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "stage of a Delta vehicle and damaged it.

Only 16 days later, a Centaur booster with an Intellsat 4A communications satellite on board also went up in flames only one minute after launch\" (*Encyclopedia Brittanica Book of the Year,* 1978, p. 638. Friends, it's time you learned the real story. In October, 1977, a newly operational Russian Cosmos Interceptor shot down *Skylab. Skylab,* along with its crew of five American astronauts secretly aboard, died in a giant fireball over the United States. NASA immediately initiated a prolonged cover-up of what had happened. How do I know? Suffice it to say, I have a very high-up source of information. END OF PART 1. PART 2: NASA wanted everyone to forget about that mysterious headline-making fireball, so they pretended that *Skylab* was still in orbit but sinking unexpectedly. NASA used stories about the Space Shuttle as part of their *Skylab* cover-up. They pretended that perhaps the Shuttle would come along in time to save *Skylab.* This was simply a double lie by NASA. First, *Skylab* could never be saved because it had already been destroyed. Secondly, the United States was in no position at that time to launch the Shuttle or anything else of a military nature into space. Russia was deploying her secret new Space Triad of advanced manned space weapons. Russian Cosmos Interceptors had starting sweeping the skies clear of American Spy Satellites, and Russian hovering electrogravitic weapons platforms, the Cosmospheres, were making headlines by creating enormous air booms along the coasts of America , and still do so. All of these things took place just as America's Space Shuttle Program was getting off the ground. AMERICAN BOLSHEVIKS - MASTERS OF DECEPTION The result was a complete reorganization of the Shuttle Program. The old plans to bathe it in continuous publicity were tossed. The \"Bolsheviks\" in our government, who had replaced the Rockefeller cartel in many areas of power, cast a net of secrecy over all the new military plans. We were never told about the capabilities of the training Shuttle *Enterprise,* and we were never told about the many things which were going on at White Sands in the military Shuttle Program. By keeping these things secret, the Bolsheviks placed themselves in a powerful position to deceive us and the deceit has continued non-stop. We were never told about the modified NASA 747 which carried a complete replica of the crew quarters and cargo bay of a Shuttle - and still does. We were unaware that that airplane, originally intended for training, was to become a Bolshevik tool of deception against us.

We were unaware that that airplane, originally intended for training, was to become a Bolshevik tool of deception against us. When we saw video tapes of astronauts in the simulated Shuttle cockpit, we naturally thought it was the real thing. Seeing a notebook float in mid-air for a few seconds next to the astronauts, we were supposed to think they were weightless because they were in orbit. We were given no clue that those moments of weightlessness had taken place months earlier in a mock-up. Further, what would you do if you were an astronaut faced with the fact that Russia has just turned the corner and can destroy your nation with one blast? Do you not think that a good patriot would go along with the game? However, that brings us to a serious problem - perhaps the pictures fooled a lot of Americans and the world - they did not fool the new rulers of Russia. They had learned the previous fall what the flight of the * Columbia * was really all about and, when the *Columbia* was launched on April 12, the Russians were ready and waiting! LAUNCH OF THE COLUMBIA INTO ODD ORBIT The real mission plan was for a short mission. The astronauts were supposed to get into orbit and deploy the military satellite from the *Columbia's* cargo bay very quickly; then they were to return to Earth - not aboard the Shuttle but in a very special re-entry capsule. Two days later they were supposed to land the disguised Shuttle *Enterprise* at Edwards Air Force Base as the final act in the falsified drama staged for our benefit. For the first time in three years the Pentagon was hoping to get a Spy Satellite into orbit that could not be shot down immediately by Russia. This attempt was destined to continue by our nerdniks into disaster after disaster. You must know what happened in the front end to have any idea what continues. If you can think back to American space launches of the past, some may have noticed something very unusual about the launch of the *Columbia.* In the past, manned space launches from Cape Canaveral were always made toward the southeast, toward the equator, but not so with the *Columbia.* It was launched to the northeast, away from the equator. The reason for this was the secret space reconnaissance mission of the *Columbia.* In its public news releases, NASA told everyone that *Columbia* was launching into a 44-degree orbit - that is, it would never go farther north or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:10:b93e3468820e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9710, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "unusual about the launch of the *Columbia.* In the past, manned space launches from Cape Canaveral were always made toward the southeast, toward the equator, but not so with the *Columbia.* It was launched to the northeast, away from the equator. The reason for this was the secret space reconnaissance mission of the *Columbia.* In its public news releases, NASA told everyone that *Columbia* was launching into a 44-degree orbit - that is, it would never go farther north or south than 44 degrees above and below the equator. But the actual orbit chosen for the *Columbia* was a 69-degree orbit. A 69-degree orbit was chosen because it would take the * Columbia , and the Spy Satellite inside it, all the way north to the Arctic Circle and beyond. That is the kind of orbit that is necessary if a spy satellite is to fly reconnaissance over Russia. The northeast launch of the *Columbia* was done in order to enable the Spy Satellite to start gathering data over Russia only minutes after the *Columbia* reached orbit. Time was of the essence in any attempt to spy on Russia. Every American spy satellite launched at Russia during the prior three years had been blinded or shot down before gathering much data. The secret flight plan for the * Columbia * was completely different from what NASA claimed in public. The plan called for *Columbia* to be launched on an initial northeast course in the general direction of Bermuda, then roughly 2-1/2 minutes after launch, *Columbia* was to begin an unorthodox course change - a wide sweeping turn into the north. This unprecedented curving launch was intended as an evasive sneak past any Russian Cosmospheres that might be waiting overhead. Still accelerating on its curving course, the *Columbia* was supposed to pass about 100 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Roughly 200 miles east of Washington, D.C., the Shuttle's main engines were to cut off. After coasting in silence for a few seconds, the fuel tank was scheduled to cut loose as the *Columbia passed 100 miles east of New Jersey. For the next two minutes the Shuttle and its fuel tank were to be coasting onward past the east tip of Long Island , over Boston , and onward toward Maine. During that time the Shuttle was supposed to maneuver away from the fuel tank, using small maneuvering jets. Finally, just as the *Columbia* passed over New Brunswick, Canada, the flight plan called for the orbital maneuvering engines to be fired. Somewhere over the Labrador Sea, flying upside-down, the *Columbia* was scheduled to reach Earth orbit. As soon as it did so, the flight plan called for astronauts Young and Crippen to go to work fast.

COLUMBIA'S SPY MISSION In less than ten minutes time they were supposed to open up the cargo bay doors and turn on the sensors of the Spy Satellite resting inside. As they did these things, the *Columbia* was to be racing over the south tip of Greenland, out over the middle of the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland, above the Arctic Circle, and then dipping back southward toward northern Norway, Finland, and Russia. According to the flight plan, the * Columbia * was scheduled to cross the Russian border just south of the strategic Kola Peninsula. This would be only some less than 23 minutes after lift-off. At that instant initial reconnaissance over Russia was to be under way. The Spy Satellite inside the cargo bay, even though not yet deployed, would have had a perfect view downward through the open doors of the upside-down shuttle. The *Columbia* was intended to fly over a course across Russia that began just west of the strategic White Sea in extreme Northwestern Russia. From there the planned course of the *Columbia* was to take it southeastward over some 2500 miles of strategic Russian territory. During the first minute alone, the satellite was expected to see parts of the highly sensitive Kola Peninsula , the White Sea , including the super secret submarine yards near Kazan, one of the bases of Russia 's flying ABM system. This system uses charged particle beams carried by supersonic TU-144 Transports. Toward the end of the first pass over Russia the Spy Satellite was expected to gather data on two more of Russia's four Cosmodromes - those of Baiokonur and Tyuratam. In between, numerous other war targets were also to come under scrutiny. The spy satellite in the * Columbia 's* cargo bay was expected to see all that during its very first pass over Russian territory. It would all take only 8-1/2 minutes. Then the * Columbia * would have crossed the border with Afghanistan , heading toward India. Barely 10 minutes later, the Spy Satellite was to be radioing its data down to the American receivers at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Now, that WAS the plan. The military planners were confident that their Spy Satellite would get at least this planned first look at Russia.

By 7:31 * Columbia * was expected to be leaving Russian skies, and by 7:45 that same Sunday morning the military planners expected to have their first reconnaissance data from Russia. RUSSIANS FOIL PLAN The plan sounded plausible but the 'planners' were falling victim to the very intelligence gap which they themselves created in America years before. Russian Intelligence agents were able to learn the general outlines of the * Columbia * mission plan some six months prior to launch. It is worse today, for there are more KGB agents in the CIA than there are \"loyal\" Americans. Fully a month before the public roll-out of the *Columbia * at the Cape in November of 1980, the Russian Space Command was studying the problem. There was no question about one thing: The * Columbia 's* mission could not be allowed to succeed. Given even a shred of up-to-date reconnaissance data, the Bolsheviks in America were determined to set off a nuclear war. Even so, there was a question about the best way to spoil the mission. Several possibilities were considered, including sabotage or simply blasting the * Columbia * out of the sky. All were rejected because they shared one weakness. Each alternative would halt one Shuttle mission, but it would not stop the Shuttle Program as a whole, and Russia 's goal was to completely shut down the Space Shuttle Program. At last they hit upon the solution. What was needed was a Space Age version of the famous U-2 incident of two decades prior. In the waning days of the Eisenhower Administration, Russia had publicly accused the United States of invading its air space with spy flights. That was before the era of Spy Satellites, and invading other countries' air space was a serious charge in the eyes of the world. American spokesmen tried to diffuse the growing furor while carefully avoiding a definitive denial of the charges; but the Russians kept it up. Finally President Eisenhower became so exasperated that he flatly denied, in public, that America was flying spy planes over Russia. That was exactly what the Russians were waiting for. The Russians promptly did what American Intelligence specialists thought they could not do - they shot down a high-flying U-2 on a flight over Russia.

The Russians promptly did what American Intelligence specialists thought they could not do - they shot down a high-flying U-2 on a flight over Russia. The name of the CIA pilot, the late Francis Gary Powers, filled the headlines world-wide overnight. The Russians had made a liar of the President of the United States. A summit had been scheduled between President Eisenhower and Nikita Kruschev, but the Russians icily called it off. In studying the * Columbia * situation, the Russians decided to make the focus of similar nature. After all, all they would need would be to land that Shuttle intact. Russia protested continuously about the military nature of the Shuttle Program, and perceived they would be able to shock the world with the truth of it by simply proving it. They would put the crashed Shuttle on public display together with its nuclear-powered, laser-firing Spy Satellite. The Kremlin liked the plan, and agreed to it. To further emphasize the parallels with the 1960 U-2 incident, Russia had recently proposed a summit with the United States. The plan was to withdraw the summit proposal in protest after shooting down the * Columbia. * The Russian Space Command went to work several months earlier to get ready. They were faced with a big order: to bring down the * Columbia * on Russian Territory without totally destroying it. As recently as only a year prior it would have been totally impossible to even consider such a thing. However, the Russians now had a new space tool to do the job. It was the third version of the Russian levitating weapons platform, the Cosmosphere. They were and are called \"Super Heavies\" by the Russian Space Command. \"SUPER HEAVIES\" MAKE READY The Russian Super Heavy Cosmospheres were still considered experimental in nature but had vast improvements integrated since the early 1980s. Even so, by '80/81 the Russians had already built seven of them. In terms of volume, they are bigger than the Goodyear Blimp, they are even bigger than the biggest dirigibles (\"zeppelins\") of the '30s. They could carry a payload of more than 50 tons, far more than the Space Shuttle; and they were equipped with powerful electromagnetic propulsion which could take the Cosmosphere all the way to orbital speed. In short, the jumbo Cosmosphere was actually Russia 's Space Shuttle. It was fully operational. In order to carry out their attack on the Space Shuttle * Columbia ,* Russia 's entire fleet of seven jumbo Cosmospheres were made ready. Five were outfitted with special grappling equipment to enable them to seize a very large object in space.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:14:00885960e882", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9714, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "the Space Shuttle; and they were equipped with powerful electromagnetic propulsion which could take the Cosmosphere all the way to orbital speed.

Five were outfitted with special grappling equipment to enable them to seize a very large object in space. The other two were outfitted with neutron particle beam weapons. These weapons were the same type as were used in the \" Battle of the Harvest Moon\" in September 1977. * COLUMBIA * BLASTS OFF At 7:00 A.M. Sunday morning, April 12, 1981, the rocket engines of the Space Shuttle * Columbia * roared to life. Moments later the giant solid boosters were fired, and the * Columbia * took off. As it climbed, it rolled around and started leaning into the flight path toward space. As we watched on television, it rapidly dwindled off into the northeast. The solid boosters separated and peeled away to each side. Moments later the * Columbia * vanished from the TV screen. The television scene then shifted to the alleged Mission Control in Houston - all of this had been set up well in advance. Yes, I know you will find this hard to believe! The NASA computer-controlled map started tracking the alleged course of the *Columbia.* According to the map, * Columbia * was heading out over the Atlantic toward Bermuda ; but at that moment, free of the solid boosters, * Columbia * was already starting its long sweeping curve to the north. One hundred fifty miles east of Charleston South Carolina, Russia's fleet of 7 jumbo Cosmospheres were hovering high over the ocean as the Space Shuttle approached on its elaborate curving path, upside-down with the huge fuel tank on top. COSMOSPHERES INTERCEPT SHUTTLE The two Cosmospheres armed with neutron beams closed in on the * Columbia * from below and a bit to the rear, where they could not be seen by Young or Crippen. The other five jumbo Cosmopheres with their grappling equipment, flew in formation above and well behind the fuel tank to be out of the line of fire. The Cosmopheres pace the Shuttle until it reached a predetermined altitude and speed. Then the armed Cosmospheres opened up with their neutron beams. Firing at point-blank range, each Cosmosphere fired just two bursts from its beam weapon, \"WHOOMP! WHOOMP!\" The first salvo flooded the cockpit area and an area near the engines in the rear. Young and Crippen died instantly, the neutron radiation having totally disrupted all activity of their nervous systems, brains, eyes, and hearts. At the same time the Shuttle's engines shut down.

A fraction of a second later, the second salvo flooded neutron radiation into the nose and an area beneath the cargo bay. These shots were calculated to derange and shut down the * Columbia 's* flight computers - that is, all the computers except one. The Russians wanted the backup computer to take over and do its job - that is, make an emergency automatic re-entry and crash landing in Russia. They anticipated that it would do so because the backup computer is heavily shielded against radiation. The shielding is a material more efficient than lead. It is GOLD! The Russians fully expected that \"Gold Computer,\" as it is known in certain circles, would take over after the engines shut down. Within some 10 seconds after the engines shut down, the fuel tank, still a third full, was automatically cast loose. The Gold Computer was now flying the Shuttle. The five jumbo Cosmospheres with grappling equipment, fastened onto the fuel tank. Then using their powerful electromagnetic propulsion, they veered away with the tank. From its northeasterly course, the tank was swerved around over the North Atlantic in a great arc until it was heading southeast instead. The Cosmospheres then accelerated to orbital speed and cast the fuel tank loose. Three years prior to this the First Cosmospheres had sen a message by way of enormous air booms along America 's East Coast. Do you remember hearing the discussion on the news about the mysterious \"sonic booms\" that were being heard along the coast? Now Russia 's newest Cosmospheres were using the Shuttle fuel tank to send a chilling new message to America 's Bolshevik war planners. Meanwhile the armed Cosmospheres followed the *Columbia * itself. Having had its engines shut down prematurely, the * Columbia * was well below orbital speed. It was following a ballistic path, just like an ICBM, into the heart of Russia. It looked as though the Russian plan was going to work to perfection - but then the unexpected happened. A NO-WIN SITUATION One of * Columbia 's* deranged computers apparently began to function. The brief shut-down had thrown it out of synchronization with the Gold Computer, so the two computers apparently did not communicate with one another. As the * Columbia * passed over the border of Russia , it was flying right-side-up instead of upside-down under control of the Gold Computer.

But the other computer opened up the cargo bay doors right on schedule. As the Shuttle began to re-enter over Russia , hot air flooded the cargo bay. Heat sensors in the Spy Satellite detected the heat build-up, which was programmed into the Satellite's computer as a sign of \"attack damage.\" Finally, the temperature built up to a critical point, activating a self-destruct circuit in the Satellite. The Spy Satellite exploded, blowing the * Columbia * to bits. The Russians had hoped for a crash landing in recognizable form. Instead, the * Columbia * ended up in wreckage strewn along a line some 85 miles long in central Russia southeast of the City of Kazan and the citizens had to be told a research satellite had fallen out of orbit. As it turned out, neither the American Bolsheviks nor the Russians got what they wanted. But there were destined to be more attempts, each just as foolish as the one before it. END OF PART 2. PART 3: On November 24, 1980, America 's Manned Space Program suddenly started showing signs of life after near death. It was the day when the Space Shuttle * Columbia * was rolled out into public view at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was the first public appearance by the Shuttle in almost two years. The Shuttle arrived at Cape Canaveral two years prior, in March of 1979. From then until November of 1980 the Shuttle * Columbia * remained in hiding in a very large metal cocoon called the \"Orbiter Processing Facility,\" but on November 24 suddenly the cocoon opened up and out popped the Space Shuttle. It was not a very long trip set for that day - about 300 yards to the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, where it disappeared once again as if by magic. For the first time in nearly six years the United States was committing itself in public to manned missions into space. The roll-out of the * Columbia * took almost everyone by surprise. America 's Space Shuttle Program was a full three years behind schedule. Since late in 1977 we heard about nothing but problems, delays, and more problems with the Space Shuttle. In fact, just five days before, Dr. George Low, former director of the *Apollo* Moon Program, summarized it all in total disgust when he said, \"Today I wonder whether we could start another *Apollo,* much less accomplish it.\" The *Apollo* moon landing program was another", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:17:932e6236704b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9717, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "took almost everyone by surprise.

For now, the centerfold of *Spotlight* newspaper for September 5, 1994, will give you some hint of the lies involved. POST-LUNAR \"QUARANTINE\" FARCE Another recent source of information on this subject was an article called \"The Great Lunar Quarantine\" in *Air & Space* magazine for February/March 1994. If you remember, when the moon-landing astronauts came back they had to be quarantined for three weeks. Thinking minds questioned the reasons for this. On page 39, the article states: \"The problem was that [the quarantine] was all show,\" says Gerald Wasserburg, John D. MacArthur professor of geology and geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, who is still fuming 25 years later. \"It really didn't prevent contamination. The people from Fort Detrick [the Army's biological warfare facility], who really knew how to contain pathogens, though it was ludicrous. It was all part of a fraud, but it couldn't be stopped because it was coming from such a high political level. Do you suppose there was some other reason for the debriefing, er, quarantining? SPACE SHUTTLE COUNTDOWN TO NUCLEAR WAR After three years on hold, the countdown was under way. There was a total air of urgency about it. Corners were being cut, safety precautions were being overstepped, unheard of risks were being taken; and when reporters asked why these things were being done, they received only double talk instead of answers. The Space Shuttle was the most complex American spacecraft built to that point. There were more things to go wrong than ever before, and the entire future of America 's Manned Space Program depended on the shuttle. In fact, we were told that within a few years the Shuttle would be launching practically all American satellites. As far as we were told, America had put all its eggs in one basket. The old NASA would have proceeded step by step with the greatest of care. Every manned spacecraft had made its first trip or two into space without astronauts to insure no loss of life in case of problems. INVISIBLE FACTIONS AT WAR In 1981 things were done in a very strange manner indeed. The facts were, our American Bolsheviks were getting ready for nuclear war, and a wartime rush mentality dominated.

INVISIBLE FACTIONS AT WAR In 1981 things were done in a very strange manner indeed. The facts were, our American Bolsheviks were getting ready for nuclear war, and a wartime rush mentality dominated. They wanted to take out the Russians before they got any stronger. It was a case of certain Russian and American forces at war with other Russian and American forces! The very first Shuttle was to be manned and was to go all the way into high orbit. There was no regard for the safety of the astronauts; however, we did not know that they had been training in the *Enterprise.* Remember the *Enterprise ?* Whatever happened to it, do you know? I was telling people at that time that something fishy was going on. For all intents and purposes, the new rocket engines of the Space Shuttle were radically untested, as far as anyone was aware. There were three main engines called SSMEs by NASA. Those engines had never flown into space prior to that time; in fact, they had never so much as been fired all together until just eight days prior to the flight. On that day, the three engines were fired for only 20 seconds on the pad at the Cape. NASA did not run the risk of running them longer even though those engines were supposed to be reusable, launch after launch. Instead, based on a mere twenty-second test, NASA would have two astronauts risk their lives on the engines and, in the actual launch into space, the engines would have to operate full-bore for a minimum of nine minutes. NASA knowingly gambled that the three fresh engines on * Columbia * would last long enough to get into orbit. The engines were only one example of NASA's unexplained haste because if * Columbia * didn't reach orbit, the next question was: Could it return? NASA didn't have the foggiest notion. The recent launching of the Hubble telescope smacks of the same subterfuge for the \"duplicate\" scope which was launched was truly another attempt to fool the Russians and again the attempt was total disaster as only an evil empire can create. HUMPTY-DUMPTY TILES In 1980 the new Thermo Protection Systems was radically new. All of the previous spacecraft had \"heat shields\" which carried away heat by burning away during re-entry, therefore they could be used only once.

How could it be OK? The heat would have burned a hole where the tile was missing. I remember they said they could not fly the * Enterprise * because they \"forgot\" to put heat shields on it, then the * Enterprise * just sort of faded from the picture. Then the * Columbia * flew with heat shields dropping off of it? Remember? Did you notice? Did you smell a rat? I did! For at least two years before the original launch we had been hearing tales about problems with tiles. It began when the Shuttle * Columbia * arrived at Cape Canaveral in March of 1979 on the back of a jumbo jet. Many tiles had been lost or damaged during the flight and the *Columbia * looked like it had smallpox - and that was just from riding piggyback in the atmosphere. GROUNDED BY THE BEAR The tile controversy made a perfect cover story to explain away the 3-year grounding of the Space Shuttle. The real reason was that America had been locked out of military space missions since late 1977. In August of 1977 the first pre-flight tests of the Space Shuttle took place. A Shuttle was carried aloft aboard a jumbo jet and cut loose and guided to a landing by the astronauts. It seemed that the age of the space shuttle was about to dawn. RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS IN SPACE Russia 's space program seemed completely silent. What we didn't know was that Russia had been deploying her secret particle beam weapons in space, and on September 17, 1977, Russia started smashing our spy satellites in what was called the Battle of the Harvest Moon. They launched their *Salyut-6* Space Station into orbit on September 29, 1977, and thus began a steady stream of Russian cosmonauts back and forth into space. They even took cosmonauts from at least seven other countries including Cuba and Vietnam into space with them, while we just wrung our hands. RUSSIAN BOLSHEVIKS FLOCK TO AMERICA The Bolsheviks had been kicked out of power in Russia , and the American Bolsheviks had been waiting long and watching for a moment of weakness among their enemies - the secret new rulers of Russia.

RUSSIAN BOLSHEVIKS FLOCK TO AMERICA The Bolsheviks had been kicked out of power in Russia , and the American Bolsheviks had been waiting long and watching for a moment of weakness among their enemies - the secret new rulers of Russia. The Bolsheviks wanted desperately to regain their former positions of power in Russia ; but for years, Russia 's new rulers had been expelling the Bolsheviks, who then flocked mostly to the United States. The Bolsheviks had originally been put into power in Russia by the Rockefeller Cartel in November 1917. They were called Communists but were merely sadistic dictators and later had been kicked out of the Kremlin. By the last half of 1980, they began to regain power in Russia so the decision was made to go ahead with the space shuttle mission. A top secret American spy satellite had been developed by the National Reconnaissance Office, a secret project that Control Date worked on (I did the paperwork for the people who programmed the satellite computer). OVERT FIRST-STRIKE BY U.S. - ALMOST Russia destroyed an American spy satellite on September 20, 1977, and a week later put our secret Moon Base out of action. Seven months later, Russia finished destroying all our spy and early warning satellites. Since then, we have tried several times to deploy spy satellites to get targeting information to launch a nuclear war, a war we have come very close to starting several times. All we found out was the Russia had moved the targets around and we dared not launch (although some wanted to anyway). BOLSHEVIKS PLAN NUCLEAR FIRST STRIKE AGAINST RUSSIA Yes, there was a full-blown plan for the U.S. to launch a first-strike nuclear war against Russia. The nuclear first strike against Russia relied heavily on missiles, including America 's secret Minuteman TX mobile missile (not the MX that the media talked about), but it could not succeed without up-to-date information on the targets in Russia. The American Bolsheviks were doing all they could to get us into a nuclear war, while they had survival shelters for themselves (but not the rest of us!). Russia had and has extensive survival shelters, working civil defense plans, and great storage facilities full of wheat, corn, oats and other supplies we gave to them (we \"sold\" the supplies to them, knowing they would not pay us back). U.S. CITIZENRY TOTALLY EXPENDABLE In the book *Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security* General George Keegan tells of the Russian civil defense shelters. He found that every factory in Russia had a shelter. The city of Moscow had 75 underground command post/shelters, each one the size of the Pentagon. Yes, that's what he said.

Every military city in Russia and most other cities had them. Keegan said that it would take five hundred billion dollars to build just one. I typed that right, billion with a \"B,\" read it again. He said they were *plush,* they even had railroad trains going into them. They have shelters along the road from the airport into downtown Moscow. Russia is fully committed if necessary to fighting a nuclear war and surviving. The United States , however, has no civil defense system at all - except for a very exclusive system for the Elite. Our program was officially called MAD, \"Mutually Assured Destruction.\" However, we would have been the only ones destroyed. If you had 20 minutes warning that hydrogen bombs were about to be dropped all across America , WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I know what many of you will say. \"I don't worry about it, whatever is God's will, will be.\" That type of brainwashing has gotten us into this mess. God's will, is for us to have free will. If you want to step in front of a railroad train, God will let you. He will not stop you! And if you do nothing about the mess you/we are in, God will let you die! If the Russians want to attack this country, or if we want to attack them, God will allow it - He allows free will to all sides! The American Bolsheviks were doing all they could to get set for nuclear war, so they were desperate for new, up-to-date reconnaissance data from Russia. Russia knew this, that is why they finished perfecting a survival plan. We, however, were totally expendable, then and now. We filled their silos with survival supplies and emptied ours. The elite Bolsheviks had, by this time, developed a satellite which they believed could survive in orbit for a while if they launched it in secret and took devious routes of flight. END OF PART 3.

END OF PART 3. PART 4: Remember *Sputnik?* I first saw it one day as I was out in the field choppin' cotten (it pains me to realize that some of my readers will not even know what choppin' cotten is). *Sputnik I* was a 184 pound ball launched by an SS-6 ICBM by Russia at 9:36 P.M. on October 4, 1957. It was highly polished to make it easier to see, and carried a radio transmitting at a frequency that made it easy for ham radio operators to track. Our government made fun of the rocket, contemptuously calling by the code name Sapwood. The MIT humor magazine *Voodoo* had a cartoon of a cutaway *Sputnik* with a bearded Russian inside saying, \"Beep...beep...beep.\" A month later Russia launched the Sputnik 2, which weighed 1,119 pounds which was in the warhead range. Although we still made fun of Russia (the Senate majority leader said we were going to launch a better satellite, with chrome trim and windshield wipers), President Eisenhower took special note of the missile. Russia had leap-frogged our expensive bomber system and was becoming able to deliver warheads with their ICBMs. Between 1956 and 1960 Ike sent over 20 U-2 flights over Russia to try to learn Russia 's missile capabilities. Every U-2 flight was monitored by radar by Russia. Our Air Force reported that Russia would have a thousand ICBMs by 1961. Two years after *Sputnik* we launched our *Discoverer* satellite, which had a camera and did a lot more than beep. We had a program called Pied Piper which did become SAMOS (Satellite and Missile Observation System). The first SAMOS launch was October 11, 1960, which failed, and SAMOS 2 was launched into orbit on January 31, 1961. The final SAMOS 30 was November 27, 1963, although officially the final *Discoverer* was 38 launched on February 27, 1962. At this point the program was changed and some of the satellites were back-named. The new program was KeyHole, and the satellites were called KH-1s (*Discoverers* were renamed KH-4s). One of the most secret branches of the government was/is the National Reconnaissance Office, established officially on August 25, 1960. I believe that one reason for its establishment had to do with flying saucers, but that is another story. NRO developed the KH-11 (By a man named Kennan) spy (photo [and other]-reconnaissance) satellite in 1972. One of the projects I worked on at Control Data involved the KH-11. The KH-11 was used for such things as finding where the hostages were held in the Iranian Embassy and supposedly for observing the heat shield tiles on the Shuttle.

It is obvious to me that they were also used to observe flying saucers, but then we all know flying saucers \"*do not* exist* so I must be wrong, right? America knew that Russia 's orbital fleet of manned Cosmos Interceptors would destroy the Shuttle, but planners hoped that before this happened the satellite would be able to radio back enough targeting information for a nuclear missile first strike. The first mission was a frantic rush job, and had to be manned because of the secret cargo. If the Shuttle reached orbit, the astronauts were to be required to deploy the military satellite inside the cargo bay. The satellite was basically a spy satellite, but it was also much more. In order to do its job, it was designed to fend off Russian space weapons for as long as possible. As a result, it would be nothing less than a robot battle station in space. It was a \"hardened satellite\" able to withstand an attack without being easily destroyed, or so they hoped. It was equipped with active defenses, it could \"shoot back.\" All the components of the satellite were crammed into the cargo bay of the Shuttle *Columbia.* They were already there when the * Columbia * was rolled out the prior November. Once in orbit, the job of the astronauts, John Young and Robert Crippen, would be to assemble it and to get it operating, and rapidly. TUNGSTEN SATELLITE POSES THREAT TO COSMOSPHERES Once it would be assembled and floating in space, the satellite would look like a giant rotating tin can perhaps 30 feet long and 20 feet in diameter, but on closer inspection it would seem to be made more like a wooden barrel except that the barrel staves are all made of tungsten. Inside the outermost tungsten barrel was another smaller barrel and inside that was a still smaller barrel. At the very center was the heart of the satellite itself. The tungsten barrels were separated from one another by a foot or more of space. There was also considerable space between the innermost barrel and the core satellite. The tungsten barrels constitute the passive defense of the satellite. If a Charged Particle Beam blast would strike the outermost barrel, it would vaporize a spot on the barrel but in the process it would absorb energy and diffuse the beam. In theory, that would greatly reduce the damage done to the second barrel and do no damage whatsoever to the innermost barrel. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any workable metal", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:24:6429e4d759a7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9724, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "the innermost barrel and the core satellite.

If a Charged Particle Beam blast would strike the outermost barrel, it would vaporize a spot on the barrel but in the process it would absorb energy and diffuse the beam. In theory, that would greatly reduce the damage done to the second barrel and do no damage whatsoever to the innermost barrel. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any workable metal in service at the time, so this system of particle beam shields was expected to last through a number of battles. The three-layer tungsten shield system was also instrumented. When a blast would strike it, the blast pattern would be sensed as an initial indication of from which direction came the attack. A computer within the core satellite would then activate a secret new target acquisition system called LADAR (Laser Direction And Ranging). The removable barrel stave sections of the rotating tungsten shields would be opened. LADAR would peek out through the openings as they rotated past in ultra-fast scanning. In the black void of space, LADAR was expected to be much more efficient than radar, picking up the Russian attacker very quickly, and the moment it would do so, the American robot battle station would open fire. When it did so, it would pose a major threat even to a Russian Cosmos Interceptor because the American satellite would be armed with a giant carbon dioxide gas dynamic blaser (CDDB). END OF PART 4. PART 5: The CDDB was a more compact version of the laser, which was successfully tested aboard a modified KC-135 jet tanker. It produced intense infrared radiation with a power of over one megawatt - which is 1,000,000 watts. An industrial 10,000 satellite laser was 100 times more powerful. I was not as powerful as the Russian Charged Particle Beam, but it was powerful enough that it should be able to cripple or destroy the Russian attacker. All this hinged, of course, on actually getting the Shuttle and payload deployed. According to the plan, the * Columbia * was intended to lift off on a sunny morning in mid-April, 1981. Millions would be watching on television as Young and Crippen roared upward into the sky and into orbit. Then the scene would shift to the standard coverage of Young and Crippen in their cockpit, and for a little over two days the coverage would continue off and on. There would be cockpit scenes, scenes in Mission Control, and so on, and there would be some seemingly unexpected problems, nothing serious but just enough to add a touch of spice to the story and the real stuff. Television viewers would have no suspicion that they were only watching excerpts from numerous simulations of the flight.

Television viewers would have no suspicion that they were only watching excerpts from numerous simulations of the flight. In its cover-up of the SKYLAB fiasco, NASA learned well the techniques of deception. Meanwhile, there would be no television coverage at all of the real flight except for the initial lift-off. Instead, when Young and Crippen reached orbit, they would go to work instantly. They would depressurize the cabin, open the cargo hatch, and move the robot spy satellite component away from the *Columbia.* They would also remove a *Gemini*-type two-man space capsule from the *Columbia* cargo bay. After moving these things several hundred yards away from the *Columbia,* the two astronauts would close the cargo bay by remote control. They would maneuver down underneath the * Columbia * for a quick visual inspection of the condition of the thermal tiles, but the urgency of setting up the robot satellite would leave no time for any attempt to repair any tiles. If the astronauts were to do that, they would lose precious time both in setting up the satellite and in making good their own escape in the *Gemini* capsule. This is why NASA refused to include a tile repair kit on the first Shuttle mission. As NASA administrator, Robert Forsch, said in a news conference, \"I felt in the end that it would be likely to increase risk, perhaps not risk with regard to the tile system but risk with regard to the safety of the whole flight.\" After a very brief inspection, the astronauts would turn over control of the * Columbia * to NASA in Houston with the words: \"Okay for retrofire.\" Then they would float away from the *Columbia* and set to work immediately on assembling the robot spy satellite. It was expected that they would complete the job within about four orbits. As soon as the robot satellite would be assembled and operating, Young and Crippen would board their *Gemini*-type space capsule. If all went according to plan, they would drop out of orbit and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. It would only be the evening of the same day of launch, but on television the falsified NASA coverage would still be showing tapes of Young and Crippen in the simulated cockpit of the *Columbia.* Young and Crippen would be then picked up at sea after their secret splashdown. From there they were to be transported to Edwards Air Force Base in California to await further events and orders.

Some 12 hours after the launch from Cape Canaveral , Houston would send a retrofire signal to the now unmanned *Columbia.* The Shuttle's engines would fire. Somewhere over the Indian Ocean the Space Shuttle would enter the atmosphere. It would be the first complete test of the Shuttle's thermo-tiles. If they worked, *Columbia* would survive re-entry. Then at lower altitude, piloting of the * Columbia * would be taken over by remote control. If all went well, the *Columbia* would touch down in the great sandy desert of western Australia. For years I used an HP-41CX hand held calculator until I wore out the keys. When I bought it, the ads said that the Shuttle astronauts carried one of these in orbit so that it would take over and land the Shuttle in case the on-board computer failed. I probably still have that literature around somewhere. The point is, the Shuttle can easily be landed (launched and flown, for that matter) by computer. It was planned that all of these things would take place during the first day of the supposed 54-hour mission of Young and Crippen. Then for the final act of the charade, we would be told on television that the *Columbia was re-entering over the Pacific Ocean; and finally, lo and behold the Space Shuttle would glide into view. Everyone would watch in awe and fascination as the Shuttle dipped lower and lower over Edwards Air Force Base, California, to the resounding double boom of the shock waves giving physical proof of the journey. The fact that everything passing through the sound barrier in flight would give a boom would be totally overlooked in the intrigue and relief of the moment. Finally the craft would touch down on the dry lake bed and gradually brake to a stop, and out would climb Young and Crippen. Everyone would assume that they were climbing out of the * Columbia ,* HOWEVER THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE DISEMBARKING FROM THE *ENTERPRISE.* It was the *Enterprise* which we saw in those landing tests in August of 1977, and it would be the familiar *Enterprise* which we would see making another perfect landing.

However, if the mission worked, it would carry off a major deceit pattern for privacy to the program, but it would also bring the entire world much closer to thermonuclear war. Although failure was anticipated and carefully covered, and as it turned out was necessary, we would be on the road to one incredible hoax following another in ever-increasing magnitude. This, of course, has been the subsequent course of events. April 12, 1981, was the 20th anniversary of the first manned flight into space. It was the anniversary of the first orbital flight by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. It also became a day of total confusion and disarray among the Bolshevik masters of America 's Space Shuttle program. Less than eight minutes after launch that Sunday morning, they knew something had happened to the *Columbia.* We were still hearing the sound effects of a seemingly successful flight, courtesy of the NASA tape recording from Houston. But the military controllers at White Sands who were following the real flight were hearing nothing at all. * Columbia * had failed to arrive over the Indian Ocean on schedule. More bad news came: NORAD was tracking the fuel tank of the Shuttle. It was not supposed to be in orbit at all - but there it was, in orbit. That looked impossible, to say the least. That evening, Sunday, April 12, the Shuttle's fuel tank re-entered over the Gulf of Mexico just south of Louisiana. The tank had ruptured but there was still a sizable amount of liquid hydrogen and oxygen inside. When the tank re-entered, it heated up and set off an enormous explosion and also created a giant cloud at the fringes of space. Goldplating, which is used extensively in the Shuttle fuel tank because of its heat transfer properties, was vaporized and scattered through the clouds which was interesting in itself and gave a wondrous show. The result was the same as when gold is added in tiny quantities to stained window glass - a brilliant pinkish-red color. The giant pink cloud, with chunks of ruined fuel tank flashing in the sun, created headlines as it passed to the northeast over Louisiana and Mississippi. Meanwhile our \"good old boys\" poo-poohed it all as, \"a natural phenomenon.\" The American elite Bolsheviks were not quite sure what had happened to the *Columbia,* but they did know that as far as Space was concerned, the Shuttle Program was their only hope.

They had three more orbital Shuttles hidden away at White Sands and they intended to launch them all, no matter what the odds might be, so the NASA cover-up of the * Columbia * disaster went right on according to plan. GENETIC REPLICAS OF HUMANS In the late part of the 1970s the existence of man-made genetic replicas of human beings was made public. The revealers were locked away instantly and the key tossed. It was disbelieved although motion pictures were made as sci-fi and the subject buried under threat of penalty of death to disclosers. They, however, did (and do) exist and were pressed into service right before our eyes. We didn't even blink at them - no sir, we just gobbled up the lie, chewed it and swallowed it in total. If I have not lost you yet, this will probably do it. Genetic replicas? Human robots? You can't be serious! you will say. Call them look-alike stand-ins if that will make it easier for you to believe, but they were in fact GENETIC COPIES. You need to study what is going on in such places as Dulce New Mexico! The Bible says that at the end time it will be like it was at the time of Noah, and records show that at the time of Noah, genetic manipulation was going on! Using stand-ins is a common procedure. For instance, the book *The Strange Death of Franklin D. Roosevelt* by Emmanuel M. Josephson, copyright 1948, said in the chapter titled \"Roosevelt's Odd Ailments and His Strange Death\" that both Roosevelt and Churchill were poisoned at the Teheran conference with Stalin. \"At Teheran Roosevelt and Churchill met with Stalin to confirm the division of the World between them. During the conference, Roosevelt had been prevailed upon by the Russians to stay at the Russian Embassy because, the Russians said, the American Embassy was not safe. At the Russian Embassy, it is reported, a special courtesy was extended to the guests. They were assigned a special waiter who served them exclusively. It was later discovered that the waiter was a physician who specialized in the science of poisoning, toxicology. The use of doctors under Russia 's state medical system in disposing of persons whom the powers-that-be wished out of the way, by poisoning them, has been attested to in the Moscow purge trials. Dr. Levine testified that he had been ordered by his superiors to poison Maxim Gorki and had done so. \"Shortly after their departure, Winston Churchill became", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:29:e4aafa16faa1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9729, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "them exclusively.

He was unable to walk or stand unassisted, and never recovered his strength.\" Friends, the man who was elected as President for the 4th term was NOT ROOSEVELT ! When he died, \"Admiral McIntyre, FDR's physician, is reported to have said that Roosevelt 's body was not embalmed; that in less than four hours after death, it had turned black, a reaction that occurs among other cases, in event of arsenic poisoning\" (p. 285). On page 286, it says, \"A careful study of the few photographs of Roosevelt released in 1944 raised the question of whether they are really photographs of Roosevelt or of a stand-in. It was widely known that there were a number of stand-ins who resembled Roosevelt so closely that they appeared for him on occasions. If the suspicions raised by the photographs are well founded, the mystery deepens. What did happen to Roosevelt? Who was it that campaigned and was re-elected in 1944?\" Who indeed? Remember, that book was written in 1948. On page 287 it says evidence indicated that Roosevelt had killed himself with a \"small silver pistol.\" It says, \"His burial without autopsy was a criminal act and a flagrant violation of the law. There is more in this situation than meets the eye.\" Ah, so! He ends the chapter by saying, \"The deception perpetrated on the public in regard to Roosevelt 's health is characteristic of that which prevailed in all matters during his Administration.\" The situation is much worse, NOW, friends! SYNTHETICS Tuesday morning, April 14, genetic replicas called \"Synthetics\" of the then late astronauts, Young and Crippen, were readied at White Sands. They were programmed to take a computerized ride on the training Shuttle *Enterprise.* The Young and Crippen entities boarded the * Enterprise * which was mounted on top of the launched 747. After rocket fuel was loaded for the Shuttle, the 747 took off and headed west, avoiding commercial air traffic. The launched 747 headed out over the Pacific until it was several hundred miles west of Los Angeles. Then it turned back east toward the California coast.

The launched 747 headed out over the Pacific until it was several hundred miles west of Los Angeles. Then it turned back east toward the California coast. On television we were told that the non-existent * Columbia * was re-entering from orbit. Meanwhile the * Enterprise ,* re-labeled * Columbia ,* was cut loose from the 747 and fired its rockets. It sped up to a speed of nearly 6,000 miles per hour, then we watched it as it made that dramatic race in from the sea to a precise computer landing at Edwards Air Force Base. It was all timed to agree as closely as possible with the official NASA timetable to further convince us of the security and efficiency of the system. Even so, a technical mistake was made that morning and as a result we were told that the Shuttle would land six minutes early. Think about it, six minutes in orbit corresponds to nearly a 2,000 mile error in the location of the Shuttle, but on TV nobody bothered to so much as question it. Everyone just smiled and said how lovely a day to watch a Shuttle land. Following the dramatic landing, former astronaut Gene Cernan expressed surprise on ABC television. He said the Shuttle simply did not look scorched enough for a ship that had re-entered from orbit. Likewise, when the synthetics called Young and Crippen emerged, they did not act like men who had been weightless for two days. Instead they bounded down the access steps and pranced around with restless energy but no one questioned it in the least. After all, we had all seen that Shuttle landing for ourselves and hundreds had been first-hand witnesses to the landing at Edwards; we had also heard and felt those sonic booms. Surely the government would not lie to us. IDENTICAL SHUTTLES WAITING Three more identical Shuttles like the * Columbia * were waiting their turn in the desert at White Sands. Each would have the same label, \"* Columbia ,*\" painted on its side. The first * Columbia * was now quite dead along with its crew, but thanks to \"doubles\" the *Columbia * would continue to live on as the astronauts would be removed from public view except on rare and \"distant\" occasions when appearance would be inevitable and actors would be able to carry out the assignments.

The speech was to gain and build support for the Administration's budget, but most people were interested because it was the first speech by the President since the assassination attempt nearly a month earlier. People were too absorbed in the dramatic re-appearance of a wounded President to pay much attention to anything else. No one cared very much that the Space Shuttle \"* Columbia *\" supposedly arrived back in Florida that day - on the back of its transport ship. The *Columbia * was a great success as far as the citizens knew - we had seen EVERYTHING OURSELVES ON TELEVISION. END OF PART 5. PART 6: SPACE SUPERIORITY TOUTED Based on that ONE Space Shuttle flight, we were then being told on all sides that we were once again on top in space. We were told that now we were five to ten years ahead of those poor, stupid Russians. The Shuttle which we all saw land at Edwards Air Force Base in California was the training Shuttle *Enterprise.* I had simply been relabeled with the name \" Columbia \" on the side. When the Shuttle landed in California April 14, we were initially told that it would be flown immediately back to Florida, but as the days went by, the Shuttle just stayed in California. NASA created one excuse after another to explain away the delays to the public. Meanwhile, frantic meetings were going on, involving key, joint military and NASA personnel. Things had not gone according to plan, and they were not sure what to do next. One faction insisted that NASA should go ahead according to the original plan. That plan called for a switch in Shuttles between California and Florida. On Day One a modified \"747\" would take off from Edwards Air Force Base, California, with the Shuttle * Enterprise * riding piggyback. News cameras would be on hand to record the take-off. The * Enterprise * would then be flown to its home base at White Sands, New Mexico. Meanwhile the public would be told that the \"747\" with the Shuttle had made an overnight stopover. Then on Day Two another modified \"747\" carrying a different Shuttle, would take off from White Sands and fly to Florida. Once again, reporters would be on hand to watch the landing at Cape Canaveral. The new Shuttle, of course, would have the name \" Columbia \" on the side just as the * Enterprise * did.

Once again, reporters would be on hand to watch the landing at Cape Canaveral. The new Shuttle, of course, would have the name \" Columbia \" on the side just as the * Enterprise * did. In that way the training Shuttle, * Enterprise ,* was to be returned to home base and a fresh orbital-only Shuttle sent to Florida. The switch would be made without the public suspecting a thing, and, after all, it is only the American public from which the above top secret secrets are maintained. The participants, by accident, believe the cover-up is in national security to prevent acceleration of the obvious war under way. Who is going to tell? In those meetings behind closed doors about the situation, others protested that it would be foolish to go ahead as originally planned without more information. It was obvious that somehow the Russians had destroyed the * Columbia ,* but the question was: \"How?\" The military Shuttle planning group agreed that they needed the answer to that question, otherwise there would be no way to devise countermeasures to give the next Shuttle flight a better chance. You see, they never considered telling the truth and shutting down the upcoming plans. Finally, it was agreed all around that the first urgent need was to buy time, so NASA spokesmen were told to give the press a series of stalling stories about the post-flight Shuttle procedures in California. Meanwhile, every available avenue of Intelligence world-wide was pressed to come up with an answer to that crucial question: \"What happened to the Space Shuttle, *Columbia?*\" Day by day we saw well orchestrated brief new reports about the postflight checkouts of the Shuttle at Edwards Air Base. The Shuttle was then lifted onto the back of the \"747,\" by the take-off kept being pushed back one day after another. The military shuttle planning group was drawing a blank from their intelligence sweep about the * Columbia. * The Shuttle stayed on the ground a week longer than originally planned, and still no answer came about the *Columbia.* You see, if by chance the Russians turned up with the *Columbia* in tow the fallout would be worse than disastrous because, for the first day or so, the exchange could not be explained away as \"preventing public panic.\" NASA ran out of excuses for further stalling without raising unwelcome questions. The secret Shuttle planning team was still in no position to prepare for a second orbital mission, and yet appearances had to be maintained at all costs and every passing day became more critical. The U.S. Government was crowing loudly about the supposed stunning success of the Shuttle because it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:33:cad09775f40e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9733, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "because, for the first day or so, the exchange could not be explained away as \"preventing public panic.\" NASA ran out of excuses for further stalling without raising unwelcome questions.

The U.S. Government was crowing loudly about the supposed stunning success of the Shuttle because it was the only hope left for America in space. The Space Shuttle was the only program, other than Defense, which was given increased funding by the Reagan Administration. There was also the incredible fear that if the Russians did, in fact, have the Shuttle intact, the entire cover-up would be exposed world-wide. The Russians, on the other hand, had no proof and couldn't come forward with actions which would have caused all-out war. WHITE SANDS CHOICES Before the Shuttle * Enterprise * left California aboard its \"747,\" the Shuttle planning group had to make a decision: Should they, or should they not, make the planned switch between Shuttles at White Sands? There were three more orbital-rated Shuttles at White Sands, and a specific mission was planned for each one. One of the planners summed up the dilemma in these words: \"How can we send an orbital bird to the Cape ?\" STS-2, 3, and 4 may require major modifications in order to get past the Russians. We won't know what those modifications are until we get the missing feedback on STS-1. I say send the *Enterprise.* We can keep it sub-orbital by faking an abort - shut-down one engine before Press-to-MECO and let * Enterprise * return to Kennedy. That will keep * Enterprise * out of danger from 'Ivan.' It will also keep the ball rolling while giving us more time to set up a successful orbital shot.\" Someone else asked: \"What about the public relations impact? One thing we don't need is to abort a mission this early in the program.\" The reply: \"Would you rather lose another orbital bird to Ivan? Besides, if we do it right, we could end up with even more public support. You know what I mean - the idea that the Shuttle is safe even if something does go wrong, and so on.\" There was a very long silence, followed by more discussion, but finally the suggestion was adopted. On Monday, April 27, the \"747\" bearing the Shuttle * Enterprise * took off from Edwards Air Force Base, California. The following day we were shown the same Shuttle, the training Shuttle * Enterprise ,* landing in Florida. There was no switch made. The secret Shuttle planners were still feeling their way and they left open an avenue for plan changes.

The secret Shuttle planners were still feeling their way and they left open an avenue for plan changes. Therefore, it would be the training Shuttle * Enterprise * that would later roll off the launch pad in Florida, that summer. It would look just like the * Columbia * did before its April launch, mated to a giant fuel tank and huge solid-rocket boosters. WILL THE REAL PLAYERS AND PROPS STAND UP, PLEASE NASA was then shooting for the very early launch date of September 30, 1981. According to the plans the launch would proceed smoothly for the first few minutes. Unlike the * Columbia ,* the * Enterprise * would not veer north toward the kind of orbit forbidden by Russia. Then, one engine would shut down prematurely. It would be earlier in the flight than the point at which contact with * Columbia * was lost in April. Then, as we were still watching on television, the * Enterprise * would return for its alleged \"emergency\" landing at Kennedy. By that time, the * Enterprise * had made so many computerized landings that NASA had confidence that the landing would be made safely. If other plans could be substituted as the summer progressed, so could the \"flight\" sequence be changed, even to aborting the launch at the pad. There would, of course, be an uproar about the aborted space flight, but it would not last long because no citizen would risk the lives of astronauts to a possible accident. The entire scenario of an abortion would \"only prove the efficiency of the computer check system and safety measures.\" The hopes were, of course, to buy time and gain information regarding the first launch. BACK TO AIR-BLASTS Let's go back to December of 1978 when air blasts at sea began shaking homes and frightening thousands along America 's East Coast. For a while government spokesmen tried to ignore them; but the booms, now known and recognized as Air Quakes, would not go away. In fact, they steadily increased in number and were also soon experienced on the West Coast and inland U.S. , as well. As no explanations could be offered, they were next ridiculed in the controlled major media, but that tactic quickly changed, too, because too many people were hearing them to accept it all as a big joke. Then the tactic was to simply report them, promising follow-up and then simply never following up. The news projectors never move from the scripts given them and there would be practically no fear of slip-ups.

The news projectors never move from the scripts given them and there would be practically no fear of slip-ups. NOte this for yourselves during prime time newscasts; flip channels and you will hear the verbatim new items being read from the master script. After these quakes had been going on unexplained for several months, the government tried to explain it all away by blaming the whole thing on freak weather conditions. Alleged experts were trotted out to impress the public with the mumbo jumbo about unusually cold air layers, ozone depletion, northern lights, electrical disturbances, and so on, ad nauseum. Waving their arms about in master performances, other experts were touting that the booms were due to military aircraft, perhaps a hundred miles out to sea since nothing showed up on any radar screens. Others managed to actually keep a straight face as they told you that the booms were caused by the *Concorde* supersonic transport and all but grounded the *Concorde* forever. They told you that the shock waves from that plane were striking America 's East Coast more than an hour ahead of the plane itself, and with incredible force, having \"built up incredible sonic force as it traveled.\" Explanations like these were ridiculous on their face; yet most Americans, eager to be pacified, accepted these insults to their intelligence at face value and even marched to stop the *Concorde* from landing in the U.S. Facts are that most of the quakes taking place nationwide were kept out of the press, and people calmed down. For instance, there are almost daily Air Quakes in areas around an Air Force Base where you might find sophisticated aircraft capable of supersonic speeds. Usually, the later seen jet craft are not the cause of the blasts but are the INSPECTION TEAMS CHECKING OUT THE LOCATION OF THE BLAST. Those of you who do not believe such a thing could be, had better think back to some unexplained booms you have noted and the media could give no explanation. As the phenomenon continued, people simply returned to sleep and ignored the interruption in their thoughts - simply no longer caring one way or another. As early as December of 1977 it was told publicly, and suppressed governmentally, that the quakes were caused from newly operational Russian Cosmospheres firing their Particle Beam weapons in a defocused mode into the air over the Atlantic Ocean - and later over the Pacific. This information came forth right out of our top intelligence systems. In 1977, there were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:36:8e361fd7c87d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9736, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "simply returned to sleep and ignored the interruption in their thoughts - simply no longer caring one way or another.

This information came forth right out of our top intelligence systems. In 1977, there were some seven Cosmospheres hovering over the U.S. , but in the months that followed the numbers grew into the hundreds worldwide. Now you can find out more if you can get your hands on the materials from the Mitre Corporation because the government sponsored a study done by them. The material was quietly released and then faded into oblivion. The report listed 594 air quakes of major impact between December 1977 and the following June. By June, of course, those alleged \"freak cold air layers\" had to be long gone. The study did its best to blame the booms on aircraft noises, anyway, but 181 air quakes were impossible to link to anything, even artificially, or to any acceptable excuse, so the report lamely concluded that they must be of some natural origin, and yet the government and military were fully aware of the origin. The Cosmospheres are Russia 's version of the Hovering Weapons Platforms of which the late General Thomas Power tried in vain to give a warning over 15 years ago. General Power was former head of Air Force Research and Development and then of the Strategic Air Command. He knew what he was talking about and made every effort possible to alert the American people over the ensuing years but his efforts were suppressed and went ignored. As the numbers of Cosmospheres multiplied worldwide during the following year, UFO sightings likewise mushroomed. Is it any wonder that the U.S. officially does not recognize UFOs and calls them weather balloons or swamp gas? SPACE ALIENS? The \"panic\" which the government is trying to keep from us is not from \"aliens;\" if aliens were the problem then we would have been conquered long ago. The problems come from very Earth-oriented, physical humans at the controls. Most UFO sightings are in fact Identified Flying Objects; they are Russian Cosmospheres. This is not to say that alien flying saucers do not exist, for the same intelligence that identifies and tracks the Soviet Cosmospheres has confirmed the existence of craft that are not from Earth. Every astronaut of our moon landing programs has said they were followed by flying saucers, before Russia developed their Flying Platforms.

Neil Armstrong said that when he stepped onto the moon, there were at least two \"flying saucers\" already sitting there watching him. He later had a mental breakdown. However, some of the moon program was also \"smoke and mirrors.\" IT'S ONLY A PAPER MOON... The Center spread of the September 5, 1994, issue of *Spotlight* newspaper has an article by a man who points out some of the obvious problems with the moon program. The author, who used the name R. Ren_, has written a book called *IT'S ONLY A PAPER MOON (PUBLISHED TITLE IS NASA MOONED AMERICA)* in which he points out some scientific facts such as the space ships and space suits do not provide enough radiation protection for the astronauts to accomplish what they claim to have done (if the suits work, why don't they use them with nuclear reactor accidents?). He says that \"the landings were faked and that the Apollo program was a very successful and expensive government hoax - a hoax that is about to be repeated using Mars as the new 'celestial' target.\" The Hubble Telescope is another NASA hoax - try reading *THE HUBBLE WARS* by Eric Chaisson. WHY ALL THE AID TO RUSSIA ? Why does our government give massive aid in money, food and technology to Russia ? Could it be to keep those Cosmospheres stationed in appropriate orbit to take out every major dam, fault line, populated city and military base in our nation? The International Banker Elite know what is going on and have situated themselves to take advantage of the destruction of five out of every six persons on earth (according to their OWN PLANS). The only reason it has not happened already is that \"They\" have held off until they could finish gold-plating their commode handles and stocking their underground warehouses. THOSE UNDERGROUND FACILITIES On this subject, here are some hints for UFO researchers. There are sonic quakes over Southern California that have been traced to an Aurora aircraft and OTHER CRAFT going to Groom Lake Nevada. If you plot that course backwards, you come to Australia. Check out the underground facilities at Pine Gap, Australia, if you want to know more about one of the hideouts of the \"Elite.\" The research shows that one of these craft flies over 4,000 miles per hour, but one who", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:38:28a6a49418fa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9738, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "here are some hints for UFO researchers.

That craft can get to Australia quicker than I can get home from work. UFOs have always been attracted by aircraft, rockets, and spacecraft, especially when those are new or experimental. The Cosmospheres are not exception to this rule. Wherever Cosmospheres are congregated UFOs will always show up and there is no exception to this rule. The \"alien\" craft observe and monitor the human craft. ALIEN CRAFT MONITORING A good example of this monitoring was witnessed in New Zealand as the secret bases there were under surveillance by the Russians. On December 30, 1978, an Australian television news crew made headlines worldwide by filming what they called UFOs from an airplane over New Zealand. The film, some seven minutes long, was purchased by the BBC and by the CBS TV Network. On January 2, CBS showed less than 50 SECONDS of the film which showed a glowing spherical object, and most of the objects sighted that evening by the camera crew and other observers were described as spheres of LIGHT. However, as the film clip was shown, a soundtrack was played. The Australian newsman described a different object. He said it looked like a flying saucer. Walter Cronkite did not say whether or not the soundtrack had been recorded simultaneously with the film clip that was being shown. In any case, the spherical object in the film was a Russian Cosmosphere, but the attempts to discredit the film were an echo of the ridiculous government stories about the air quakes the prior year. On the evening of January 25 Walter Cronkite of CBS News reminded viewers of the New Zealand UFOs; then he went on: \"Well, the New Zealand Air Force reported today that freak atmospheric conditions, not visitors from outer space, were responsible. Investigators said one definite cause was an unusually bright \"Venus\" rising in the eastern sky.\" PAY ATTENTION - THIS IS FROM \"EARTH\" The \"friendly\" \"alien\" craft will show strobing \"COLORED\" lights of red, green, yellow, blue. They are stationed in non orbiting sequence in strategic placements. The Cosmospheres do not strobe, and are stationed to appear as stars and planets. This is the real reason that there is a lot of hocus pocus involved with the Hubble Telescope, they cannot afford to let us see what that can see. END OF PART 6.

This is the real reason that there is a lot of hocus pocus involved with the Hubble Telescope, they cannot afford to let us see what that can see. END OF PART 6. PART 7: RUSSIAN SPHERES AND PLATFORMS, AND HELP FROM ALIENS The Russian craft are not always visible; actually they are almost never visible and from an orbiting standpoint they are as any other satellite which would be too small to be seen by the eye alone. They are shielded by a very sophisticated stealth shielding system. The \"aliens\" sometimes neutralize the Russian systems in hope that we will see them and wake up to what is happening, but we are too brainwashed to accept the truth. You may ask, if the aliens are benevolent, why don't they help us? Who would they help? Which side is the \"good guys?\" We have to first ask for their help, then we have to accept their help and follow their rules. Instead, both the American and Russian (and other) governments have tried to shoot them down. The flurries of UFO sightings over Australia and New Zealand were actually due to Cosmospheres with monitoring alien craft along with some of our own monitoring craft with sufficient speed capability. The U.S. in the 1970s decided to outflank Russia by deploying Minuteman and other nuclear missiles all over the world, since our main bases such as Edwards, White Sands, etc., were all monitored by Russian Cosmospheres. We believed that we could disable the Cosmospheres long enough to launch a missile attack against Russia. We came very close to doing just that several times, but each time we were defeated by the Cosmospheres which saved the world from nuclear nightmare. Who are the \"Good guys,\" friends? COBALT ION BOMS AND LASERS It is well known to U.S. scientific intelligence analysts that the Cosmospheres hover by floating in the earth's electro-static field. They also presume that the Russians use the same techniques we would use in order to aim their Particle-beam weapons - that is, a combination of infrared detection and radar. They reasoned that if the Cosmospheres can be disturbed from their hovering positions and if their sensing systems can be blinded, their particle-bam weapons would do no good - even if they fired they would be aimed wildly and miss our rockets as they would be launched. The solution devised was called a Cobalt Ionization Bomb. Unlike a normal cobalt bomb, such a device is not designed to create a tremendous blast; its primary purpose, instead, is to create tremendous quantities of totally ionized cobalt atoms stripped of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:40:cff6c57b99de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9740, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "disturbed from their hovering positions and if their sensing systems can be blinded, their particle-bam weapons would do no good - even if they fired they would be aimed wildly and miss our rockets as they would be launched. The solution devised was called a Cobalt Ionization Bomb. Unlike a normal cobalt bomb, such a device is not designed to create a tremendous blast; its primary purpose, instead, is to create tremendous quantities of totally ionized cobalt atoms stripped of all their electrons, leaving bare nuclei. The plan is to detonate these at various locations in the upper fringes of the atmosphere, as high as possible, but below the hovering altitude of the Cosmospheres. The result will be an enormous storm of electrons, spreading horizontally in the Earth's magnetic field to pass underneath the Cosmospheres. When you hear in the news that we have recently launched a satellite that \"illuminates the electrostatic/magnetic field,\" does that make more sense now? And do you remember that the launch was considered to be a secret military mission? It would also disrupt the infrared and radar systems used to watch the missiles below; and while the Cosmospheres are briefly incapacitated in this manner, our rulers planned to launch our ICBMs right past them. Meanwhile, ground-based high-power lasers would be used in the effort to shoot down the Cosmospheres. But, my friends, your masters fell victim to the very intelligence gap which they themselves brought about years past, which I wrote about in my newsletters in 1978, because the Russians well understand the importance of surprise, including technological surprise. And so, while they have allowed their space triad to become known in intelligence circles because of it deployment, they still have a master secret weapon in reserve for the war itself. This weapon is a system to protect the Achilles' heel of their beam-weapons - the ability to aim them accurately. It is called \"Psychoenergetic Range Finding\" or PRF. PRF does not rely on conventional radiations like infrared or radar - instead, it is based upon detection of the actual atomic signature of the target, and normal jamming techniques have no effect whatsoever on PRF. Therefore, when the American cobalt ionization bombs explode, the Cosmospheres would be able to aim right through the electron storms to blast our missiles or ANYTHING ELSE in the target. In November an alternate plan for the second launch was presented. This plan would be an abbreviated orbital mission. So, the second Space Shuttle launch took place from Cape Canaveral Florida, on November 12, 1981, seven months after the first launch. Some seven hours after launch it was announced that the flight was going to be cut short. Therefore, the secret plan for an abbreviated mission was verified and under way.

Some seven hours after launch it was announced that the flight was going to be cut short. Therefore, the secret plan for an abbreviated mission was verified and under way. As an excuse, NASA pretended that a faulty fuel cell was responsible for shortening the mission. The abbreviated Space Shuttle mission in November was the legacy of the total disaster which engulfed the first Shuttle launch in April. In November, just as the prior April, no part of the real Shuttle flight was heard other than the Florida take-off. The identical theatrical techniques that were used to fool the public in April were again utilized, including some of the same taped segments - no one noticed, not even when the story did not match the sound or pictures. Remember, we watched the *Columbia* take off but it was the *Enterprise* that landed in California. The *Enterprise* was a very specially designed Shuttle, unlike the *Columbia* or the three other Shuttles which secretly existed at White Sands. The *Enterprise* was a training Shuttle with its cargo bay filled with rocket fuel tanks. Launched from the top of an airborne 747, the *Enterprise* was able to make short suborbital flights into space, but due to its fuel tanks it could carry no payload in its cargo bay. In the wake of the secret Space Shuttle disaster in April, the military Shuttle planners sent the *Enterprise* to Florida. Originally, they were simply trying to buy time. But time was going by quickly because the American Bolsheviks were on an accelerated timetable to bring about WAR! Arguments broke out among the military Shuttle planners over the original plan to throw away a launch just to keep up appearances. A scheme was finally constructed to use the *Enterprise* itself in November for a military mission. COMPUTER SCAPEGOATS Just as computers are handy for helping with the workloads of people, they also make handy scapegoats to cover a massive multitude of errors and omissions. This time a computer problem would be the important factor in deliberately shortening the second Shuttle flight - as information to be lied forth to the public. So, on the evening before the launch, there was a sudden flurry of activity at Cape Canaveral. Supposedly a data processing module aboard the Shuttle - that is, part of its computer system - \"was misbehaving.\" We were told that a replacement was flown in, and we saw workmen rushing to install something aboard the Shuttle. It was all going on, literally, at the very last minute, just before the large external tanks started being loaded with rocket fuel.

It was all going on, literally, at the very last minute, just before the large external tanks started being loaded with rocket fuel. The last minute rush at Pad 39-A that evening on November 11 was not to load a computer module as we were told - and shown. Instead, special photo reconnaissance equipment was installed in the rear deck of the crew compartment. It was arranged to look out of the two overhead windows. The * Enterprise * was unable to carry a spy satellite in its cargo bay as mentioned earlier, so instead the * Enterprise * itself was turned into a spy satellite. The makeshift spy apparatus installed in the crew compartment rear deck was not as good as that of a regular spy satellite, but the military planners were desperate. By the way, you can fool your friends quite easily but you can rarely fool your enemy for they are watching most closely and the Russians knew, moment by moment, what was happening. It would soon be four years since Russia finished destroying all of the American spy satellites with her fleet of Killer Satellites. The military Shuttle team was hoping to use \"surprise\" in order to get at least a little bit of reconnaissance over Russia. It was hoped that the Russians would consider the *Enterprise* to be no threat since it could not carry anything in its cargo bay. NASA, also, did everything it could to convince the Russians that a non-threatening orbit would be used. Finally, the launch time was shifted by about 2-1/2 hours on the morning of November 12th. That was intended to make it harder for the Russian Cosmos INTERCEPTORS to readjust their orbits to attack the * Enterprise. * The last item reflects a deadly intelligence error made by the United States military Shuttle team. They knew about Russia 's orbital cosmos interceptors, the Killer Satellites. They also knew about the first generation Cosmospheres, Russia's Levitating Weapons Platforms. Both were first deployed some four years prior. The American planners knew that the Space Shuttle COULD probably outrun the \"first-generation\" Cosmospheres, therefore they believed that the orbiting cosmos interceptors were the main threat to the Shuttle. WHAT THEY DID NOT KNOW - BUT DID SUSPECT - WAS THAT RUSSIA HAD DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED A SMALL FLEET OF SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL SECOND GENERATION COSMOSPHERES. In April there had been seven in operation - by November there were at least eight or nine. The new Cosmospheres were called \"Super Heavies, or \"Jumbos,\" and could outrun and outlift anything America had, including the Shuttle.

The new Cosmospheres were called \"Super Heavies, or \"Jumbos,\" and could outrun and outlift anything America had, including the Shuttle. The Russians even gave NASA pointed information about them as far back as the April launch. There were some in America 's intelligence community who correctly interpreted what happened and informed the planners. But the American Bolsheviks who controlled America 's military space program were refusing to accept it. They were explaining away the fragments of intelligence about the new Russian Jumbo Cosmospheres and thereby guaranteeing their own failure. When the * Enterprise * took off there were no human pilots aboard. It was a known suicide mission. The * Enterprise * followed an evasive, curving launch, just as the * Columbia * had done in April. It headed toward the north which would indicate a near polar orbit. When it passed over Russia the * Enterprise * was to be upside down with its spy camera staring downward through the crew compartment windows. Five nice bit fat Jumbo Cosmospheres were right on hand and kept pace along with quite a good number of \"alien\" craft, as it climbed toward orbit. Moscow was instantly notified of the course it was taking - but the Russians were told not to fire on the Shuttle. Instead the Russian Ballistic Missile Defense Forces were alerted. The Russians knew war was coming and the decided to use the approach of the Shuttle as a good test drill. PROTECTION SYSTEMS It had been known for two years that Russia had been preparing to deploy a new anti-ballistic missile system and underground shelter systems were improved and renovated along with new shelters being installed and totally updated for the population security. Our government did nothing for us good tax-paying citizens. The new missile system was based on charged particle beam weapons fired from modified supersonic TU-144s Jet Transports. On November 12 a squadron of TU-144s were scrambled to intercept and shoot down the * Enterprise. * The Jumbo Cosmospheres continued pacing the Shuttle from a distance as a backup if the TU-144s should fail - but they, of course, did not fail.

NASA went ahead with its made-for-television space movies and followed the preplanned script for a shortened mission. They knew within the hour after launch that the * Enterprise * had been destroyed. Having learned about Russia 's plans, in April, to create an international incident with the crashed Shuttle, they wanted to complete the flight, in the world's eyes, quickly. The Shuttle landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 14th was a replay of the Shuttle we saw the previous April. Literally, those long distance telephoto shots of the Shuttle swooping in from the stratosphere were the very same ones that were shown in April. NASA merely fed videotapes of the long distance scenes from April to the networks and added a fresh narrative to them. The only part of the landing that was live in November was the terminal portion which could be seen from the ground. The Shuttle we were shown landing was one of the new Shuttles from White Sands. It had been carried aloft by the launch aircraft, boosted to a modest speed and altitude by a pair of solid fuel booster rockets - enough to produce sonic resonance, and then it swooped down to the delight of the attending crowd. Since we all witnessed how well that second Shuttle worked out the next launch was already set for March, just three months from that perfect landing. It was planned to launch the third Shuttle right on schedule. Well, * Enterprise * would no longer be an embarrassing problem to NASA. We now had a new Shuttle, the third we were shown with \" Columbia \" on it and it awaited at Cape Canaveral. Its cargo bay awaited a NEW secret military pay load. That particular Shuttle had really been modified and ARMED FOR BATTLE in space. Our idiot Bolshevik military planners continued and still continue to refuse to understand what they are really up against - and thusly, another tragedy was already in the final stages of being made. OVERVIEW OF WORLD EVENTS To give an overview of the world events coincidental to the Shuttle launches, we need to go back to the attempted assassination of Reagan, March 30.

That news flashed myriads of questions around the world instantly as old concerns were triggered. Would some other country try to take advantage in some way? Most of all, would Russia decide to invade Poland ? At that time headlines were telling us that an invasion might be imminent. As it turned out then, our worries about that were unfounded but we had no way to know. Instead of \"invading,\" the Russians were in the process of cooling down the latest \"Solidarity\" labor crisis. Likewise, other nations around the world generally acted with restraint following news of the shooting and literally, without much surprise or reaction, for the planners know the plans. That is, all except one - the lone exception was ISRAEL ! You may want to look closely at the next bits of information and see what you can discern. ISRAEL The timing could not have been more precise, *if it had been planned in advance.* As the first shocking bulletins of the shooting flashed across America , Israeli war planes were starting their engines. As White House spokesmen were gathering to brief the press, ISRAELI FIGHTER BOMBERS WERE GATHERING OVER LEBANON. Through that afternoon and evening Americans huddled around their television sets for the latest word from George Washington University Hospital, completely transfixed on the happenings of our own day and totally distracted from anything else which might be occurring in the world. Meanwhile, Lebanese villagers were huddling in basements and bombed-out shelters as Israeli missiles and bombs exploded all around them. On the BBS World Service and other short-wave radio news reports around the world, the sudden new Israeli raids on Lebanon that day were very big news indeed. But not so in America. News of the presidential shooting and its aftermath drowned out everything else just exactly as it was supposed to do and you will never be told what REALLY happened with that shooting incident - but it didn't go exactly or precisely as planned but it did its job - after all, we ALL saw it, didn't we? It was not until Syrian troops began making moves in response to the Israeli raids that Lebanon began to enter our consciousness in America. Day by day, the Israelis and Syrians lashed out at one another more and more, directly and through surrogates in Lebanon. On April 28, Israeli jets shot down two Syrian helicopters over Lebanon. It was tremendous news overseas, but in the U.S. it was completely ignored in favor of an all-networks coverage of the President's speech to Congress the same evening.

It was not until the following day, April 29, that the Lebanon crisis received billing in the American controlled major media. MIDDLE EAST CRISIS The Syrians had moved Russian SAM-6 anti-aircraft missiles into the Beka Valley of Lebanon. This was Syria 's answer to Israel 's shooting down of two of her helicopters the day prior over Zahle. Thus, the Middle East missile crisis was born. END OF PART 7. PART 8: U.S. - JAPAN FEUD Another looming crisis was the growing FEUD between the U.S. and Japan. It seemed as if Washington couldn't do anything right toward the Japanese. On the morning of April 10, 1981, the first attempt to launch the Space Shuttle * Columbia * took place at Cape Canaveral. It ended in failure due to a computer problem, but it was the top story that day in America. It all but buried the news story that was tops that day in Japan. The prior day, an American submarine had sunk a small Japanese freighter, supposedly by ramming it. Then the submarine had left the scene without making any attempt to rescue survivors. Worse yet, because the U.S. had not even admitted the incident to Japanese authorities until some 36 hours after the incident, the episode raised more and more questions in Japanese minds. NAVY HAS DIFFERENT STORY - AS USUAL The U.S. Navy issued a report about it which differs drastically from the testimony of the 13 Japanese survivors. The Navy report even put the location of the collision 3-1/2 miles away from where it actually happened. The Japanese wanted to know WHY! The Japanese began demanding answers to that and many other puzzling questions about the incident. The supposedly \"accidental\" sinking of the Japanese freighter was only the opening gun in the Washington-Tokyo feud. One shock after another from America rocked Japan. American naval vessels sailed through Japanese fishing fleets, cutting fishing nets to ribbons. Suddenly, there were revelations that American ships with nuclear weapons aboard were using Japanese ports regularly, in secret. Secretary of State Haig canceled a visit to Japan. Even the visit of Prime Minister Suzuki to Washington recently had backfired on him. He agreed to language in a joint communique that led to accusations in Japan that Suzuki was making a secret military alliance with the United States. The irony of it all was that Suzuki's troubles were due to the fact that he was resisting any such military alliance.

The irony of it all was that Suzuki's troubles were due to the fact that he was resisting any such military alliance. The facts, of course, were that an attempt was being made to pressure the Japanese because of the massive amounts of counterfeit money from South America and the Antarctic. In addition, the Bolsheviks in the U.S. wanted Japan to re-arm, to become the policemen of the Western Pacific. Suzuki's predecessor, Prime Minister Ohira, was ready to go along with America 's Bolsheviks despite stern warnings from Russia not to. Then, surprise of surprises, Ohira died suddenly and Suzuki replaced him. Suzuki didn't want to re-arm Japan , and so America 's Bolsheviks wanted him out of office. Japan had endured all kinds of shocks in those particular months, but they all had one common denominator: they all involved loss of face for Japan as a whole and especially for Prime Minister Suzuki, and that is most painful for such an Oriental people. In Asia , loss of face is a very, very serious matter. By using it as a political weapon, America 's Bolsheviks believed they could bring down the Suzuki government. Whoever would follow Suzuki would have to talk \"peace\" for domestic consumption, but he wold have to prepare for war if he was to get along with Washington. OTHER PLACES Elsewhere in Asia , Red China and Vietnam had recently engaged in very heavy border fighting with many casualties. Meanwhile, the so-called Reagan Administration was preparing to declare openly that it would sell America 's most sophisticated weapons to Red China. Might you agree that the cancer eating away at America had caused total insanity? Do you think it has improved in the years since? Well, it surely has gotten far worse. You have no idea what kind of a decade the 1980s really was. In Europe , too, there was turmoil at the hands of Bolshevik agents. The government of Italy had just been brought down in a tremendous scandal involving a massive conspiracy of many of the country's leading citizens. In West Germany , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was under fire from forces who wanted to undo the balance he had struck between East and West. And in France the Bolsheviks won a tremendous victory in the election. Until then, France had enjoyed a special relationship with Russia as well as with the West. The relationship was one of trust built up laboriously beginning with the former President Charles de Gaulle; but the new French President, Mitterrand, was working as fast as possible to change that.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:48:0eee487020d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9748, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "Helmut Schmidt was under fire from forces who wanted to undo the balance he had struck between East and West.

Mitterrand would try to bring France into the anti-Russian camp, headed by the American Bolsheviks. Note his current presence at every open meeting and secret meeting and put your own puzzle pieces in place. At the time, crises large and small were multiplying and compounding all around us, and by and large they were not accidental. They were part and parcel of the deliberate war build-up strategy of the Bolsheviks in America. By turning the world into a cauldron of crises, they were setting the stage for NUCLEAR WAR NO. ONE. The entire world was filled with unrest just like the uneasy Balkans just prior to World War I. Has the confusion lessened? World War I was set off, seemingly by accident, by the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria by terrorists. When the Space Shuttle * Columbia * took off on its ill-fated flight on April 12, 1981, a fleet of special airplanes were aloft to help track it. The U.S. was depending heavily on its fleet of advanced range-instrumentation aircraft. These were flying radar and communications stations known as \"Froop Snoots\" for their huge bulbous nose. This special airplane was a modified military Boeing 707, designated *EC-135N.* When they were not involved in space shots, the *EC-135Ns* also have many other uses, including the tracking of Russian satellites. There were only a few of these *EC-135ns,* so they were all very important. When the Space Shuttle * Columbia * took off in April, there were only eight of them. The Space Shuttle Program was an indispensable key to the underway war plans of the Bolsheviks, and the *EC-135Ns* were crucial to the Shuttle Program. On May 6, 1981, an *EC-135N,* nicknamed the *\"Boss Hog,\"* took off from its base in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. It headed east on what was to be a routine training flight. As the modified 707 flew eastward, it was heading for an unexpected rendezvous. Hovering high over the rolling hills of western Maryland, a lone Cosmosphere was waiting for the *Boss Hog.* At 10:51 A.M. Eastern Time the pilot of the jet radioed the words \"Flight level 29\" to controllers on the ground. The plane was at 29,000 feet. Moments later the Cosmosphere fired its Charged Particle Beam weapon downward at the jet plane passing miles below it.

Moments later the Cosmosphere fired its Charged Particle Beam weapon downward at the jet plane passing miles below it. The beam blasted a hole through the top of the fuselage and another out through the bottom. Explosive decompression emptied the cabin of its air. The blast also set off a secondary explosion, turning the jet into a ball of flames. At the same time control cables through the tail were destroyed, and the jet turned violently nose down. Instead of gliding to a crash many miles away, the ruined airplane dropped like a rock, almost straight down. Radar traffic controllers were startled to see the plane disappear suddenly from their screens, but it was all documented. It was all over before they even knew anything had happened, however. On the ground, eyewitnesses heard a boom-boom-boom, and moments later a giant ball of fire came screaming downward out of the clouds. For at least ten minutes small pieces of debris from the plane kept settling earthward for miles around. In any air disaster as violent as that one, the investigation usually extends over a period of months - but not this one. On Friday May 29, just over three weeks after the crash, the Air Force quietly announced that its investigation was already over and there had been \"some type of pilot error\" doing something to the whatchit which engaged the wrong whichit and poo! The Air Force knew what had blown their radar plane out of the air, but they also declared that \"for the time being the results would not be made public.\" While the Air Force was still reeling from the crash of the valuable *EC-135N,* it became the Navy's turn to have some fun. Is any of this beginning to allow you to piece together what \"probably\" happened to all those naval excursions? How about gun turret blow-outs, etc.? The particle beams ARE SO EXACTING THAT THEY CAN BE SHOT RIGHT INTO A JET TURBINE - IN FLIGHT. Once again Russia 's target was a highly sophisticated electronic warfare jet. The plane involved was an EA-6B Prowler based on the nuclear supercarrier, *USS Nimitz.* On the night of Tuesday, May 26 (1981) the *Nimitz* was engaged in night-landing exercises just off the East Coast. Carrier landings are always dangerous, and night landings especially so; but the EA-6B has a special advantage.

It is equipped with an Automatic Carrier Landing System to permit safe landings even in conditions of zero visibility. Partly as a result, the Prowlers are known as some of the safest of all carrier aircraft; but on the night of May 26 one of Russia 's new Jumbo Cosmospheres was hovering high above the *Nimitz.* It was one of the two which are armed with a Neutron Particle Beam Weapon. As the EA-6B approached the *Nimitz* to land, the Cosmosphere waited. At a critical moment of the final approach, the Cosmosphere fired. The invisible neutron beam instantly killed the crew of three and temporarily deranged the airplane's electronic systems. Being suddenly without guidance, the jet veered to the right and crashed into a deck full of airplanes. The toll: 14 dead, 48 injured, and 20 aircraft destroyed or damaged. It was the Navy's worst flight-deck disaster since the early 1950s. U.S. TAUNTS RUSSIA During those times there was a lot of hocus pocus about \"national security.\" What did that mean? Could there be any such thing as National Security without National Survival? Funny thing - our leaders kept telling us that the threat to our security was Russia. Then, while we were not looking, they turned right around and TAUNTED THE RUSSIANS. Here is an example. The supercarrier *Nimitz* entered port only very briefly after the fiery crash of the EA-6B. It entered port on May 28 and left again just two days later, May 30. The official story was that it was heading for the Caribbean for continued exercises. The *Nimitz,* however, was ordered to the north, not to the south. In a drastic departure from normal procedure, an American carrier group was ordered into the Norwegian and Barents Seas , right on the doorstep of Russia. The deployment was expected to be brief, but it was indeed most dangerous to say the very least. It was in insane act of bravado by the American Bolsheviks, like walking up to a bully and throwing salt into an open wound. The Russians had had their day and felt no need to push their advantage but undoubtedly there would come a time when the push would go too far. LIES: BIG THEN AND BIG NOW The lie of National Security was as big a lie then as it is now. The more we pretend to spend on National Security the less security we can achieve.

There was so much going on at this time that I do not have time to even begin to mention is all, in Iran , Central America, Israel, etc. In January, 1982, Russia renewed geophysical warfare involving weather modification and artificial earthquakes - something which is going on now more than ever. Parts of Canada suffered such extreme blizzard conditions that a \"National Emergency\" was declared. For over four years Russian electrogravitic weapons platforms called Cosmospheres had been hovering high over the U.S. They first announced their presence by creating giant air booms along the coasts. Their number continued to multiply and they patrolled continuously over all types of American strategic target areas. Our American Bolshevik planners planned to shoot down as many Cosmospheres as possible using high-power lasers, when war came. Until late 1981, it was all but impossible for us to even detect the presence of the Cosmospheres floating overhead. They were invisible to normal radar, except at very close range, but by late 1981 one crash weapons program had come up with a system that could sometimes detect the spheres and allow laser aiming. The new technique was called \"Computer-Enhanced Infrared.\" It was an extremely sensitive means of detecting the heat radiation given off by Cosmospheres. It was recognized by the acronym CEIR (pronounced seer). On the evening of January 12, 1982, a complete operational test was carried out against a Cosmosphere which was patrolling high over central New Jersey. CEIR was used to aim a ground-based high-power laser at the Cosmosphere, then the laser was fired. A section of the Cosmosphere erupted into blue-green flames. As the flames started to spread, the crew accelerated the Cosmosphere toward the coast because all Cosmospheres are under very strict orders to make certain that their craft NEVER fall into non-Russian hands, and they were making for the sea post haste. The stricken Cosmosphere, trailing blue-green flames, was seen over a very large area of eastern Pennsylvania and central New Jersey. It had been hovering at an altitude of more than 40 miles, but it came down fast. Its semi-rigid shell started crumpling. It passed over Atlantic City at low altitude and plunged into the water just a few miles off shore. Many witnesses watched as the remains of the Cosmosphere burned, floating on the surface of the water for some ten minutes.

The whole incident created a sensation in the local region, but official Government spokesmen treated it all as a usual non-event! The first downing of a Cosmosphere created shock waves in the Kremlin. It was decided very quickly that a clear message would be sent to the Pentagon that they would pay dearly if the incident should be repeated. The Russians knew that a laser had shot down their Cosmosphere so the very next day (January 13) an Air Florida Boeing 737 jetliner Flight 90 with laser warfare specialists aboard was caused to crash in Washington D.C. The plane crashed into a crowded bridge, broke into pieces, and sank into the river moments after takeoff from National Airport during a snowstorm. The crash claimed the life of 74 of the 79 persons on the plane and 4 others in vehicles on the bridge. Perhaps you remember seeing some of the rescue attempts. Isn't war fun? FOLLOW-ON CRASHES Then followed a string of crashed and near-crashes - all of them supposedly unexplainable. All four Air Force Thunderbird demonstration jets were made to crash. A Boeing 737 in California dropped far below its flight path, seemingly without cause, and narrowly missed disaster as it clipped some power lines. And strangest of all, a Japan Air Lines DC-8 crashed into Tokyo Bay on February 9th during the final moments of its landing approach. It was a perfect flying day, clear and sunny. The DC-8 was only 1000 yards from touchdown, flying in a gentle glide. There were no mechanical problems. Suddenly, the pilot acted as if he were dazed. Reportedly he reached over and reversed thrust on two of the four jet engines. The big jet nosed downward; it smashed into light stanchions marking the approach path and crashed into the shallow water; 24 persons were killed and some 150 others were injured. Later, in the hospital, the pilot said he had blacked out. The co-pilot reportedly said he, too, suddenly felt woozy, but fought it and remained conscious. Suddenly there was a release of information regarding UFOs and cover-ups of alien visitors and thus and so.

The Russians were saying to the American Bolshevik Pentagon in effect: \"If you shoot down any more Cosmospheres, there would be no place to hide.\" In February of 1982, there were three main Power Factions struggling to become king-of-the-hill. One faction was that of the Rockefeller cartel - the multinational complex of Big Oil, Big Banking, and Big Business. Another faction was the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis with headquarters shared between New York City and Jerusalem. The third faction was that of the NEW rulers of Russia who had expelled most of the Bolsheviks formerly in power there. ROCKEFELLER-RUSSIAN CARTEL A new operational relationship was in the works between Russia 's new ruler and the Rockefeller cartel. The arrangement, however fell far short of the prior closeness. The new arrangement was one of, basically an agreement not to damage one another as a matter of deliberate policy. The prime objective was to free both of them (the Russians and the Rockefeller cartel) to deal with their now mutual enemy, the American Bolsheviks who had infiltrated key policy-making government positions in Washington. The main area in which the Rockefeller cartel could be helpful to the Russians was in the economic sphere. The American Bolshevik-dominated foreign policy in the U.S. was a policy of economic starvation against Russia and her satellites. The Rockefeller cartel was in a position to partially blunt those policies by cooperating with Russia in the East-West trade. American Bolshevik economic warfare against the Soviet bloc was most apparent right then in the plight of Poland. The American Bolsheviks were finally succeeding in using the Solidarity Labor Union to push Poland into martial law. Martial Law was being used as an excuse to make the Polish people suffer even more at America 's hands. A thinly disguised food embargo was in place by the U.S. against Poland. Even chicken feed was being held back in order to create disaster for Poland 's own chicken farms. Everything possible was being done to drive the Polish people to such desperation that open revolt would erupt. The collapse of Poland posed a military threat to Russia and was an economic drain as well. Russia 's new rulers were working with an unwieldy, centralized economy left behind by the expelled Bolsheviks. It could not be changed overnight so the Russians were vulnerable to economic warfare. In order to avoid economic disaster, the Russians were pushing hard for new ways to raise hard Western currency. One such move was a major coup in U.S. Treasury securities but, for the long term, the Russians wanted to establish more stable and mutually beneficial economic ties with the West.

One such move was a major coup in U.S. Treasury securities but, for the long term, the Russians wanted to establish more stable and mutually beneficial economic ties with the West. SIBERIAN GAS PIPELINE The centerpiece of Russia 's economic drive became the Siberian gas pipeline for Western Europe. It was a 25 billion dollar project, the biggest ever between the Soviet Union and the West. It would be completed in 1984. The Bolsheviks were trying to completely stop the pipeline project, but the Rockefeller oil and business cartel was working diligently to assist the go-ahead of the project. In mid-February the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a long-time Rockefeller public relations organ, went public about the pipeline. It called the Reagan embargo against pipeline equipment a strategy of economic warfare against Russia. The \"Joint Economic Committee\" of Congress endorsed the pipeline project and in Europe , American multinational oil companies were lining up in support of the gas pipeline - all of them, that is, except one, Mobil Oil. Unlike the other members of the Rockefeller Big Oil cartel, Mobil Oil in West Germany had been publicly opposing the gas pipeline which, of course, was most interesting in itself. To the Russians the gas pipeline was a matter of economic survival and, with all-out war on the horizon, the Kremlin had no patience with those who said one thing and did another. The Russians regarded Mobil's position against the pipeline as a double cross, in effect siding with the Bolsheviks in America. Russia 's rulers decided to give Mobil Oil strong reasons to rethink their position, and fast. On Thursday, February 11, the Russian container ship, *Mekhanik Tarasov,* departed from a port in Quebec, Canada, bound for Leningrad. It headed northeast up the St. Lawrence River , then out through the Gulf of St. Lawrence into the Atlantic. After skirting the south coast of Newfoundland, the *Tarasov* set course east by northeast. Its course was chosen to take it very close to the world's largest semisubmersible oil rig, passing it on the south. Guess what? - the rig was the *Ocean Ranger,* operated by none other than Mobil Oil. It was supposedly unsinkable - just like the *Titanic.* The *Tarasov,* like many other Russian merchant ships, possessed a military capability that was not admitted. As it neared the giant oil rig in a mounting storm, it launched a homing torpedo with a low-yield nuclear warhead toward the rig. Just before 1:00 A.M. Monday morning, February 15, the torpedo reached its target, one of the giant underwater pontoons.

Monday morning, February 15, the torpedo reached its target, one of the giant underwater pontoons. Nuclear explosions under water are far more confined than those in the air, and this one was well hidden by the hurricane-force winds and pounding waves. A hole was blasted in the pontoon, and the *Ocean Ranger* started settling toward the side. The crew gave a trouble call by radio; half an hour later they reported that they were manning the lifeboats. But the Japanese-built *Ocean Ranger* was designed to be the world's most unsinkable oil rig! A corner of the upper platform dipped into the water and then stopped. The rig stayed afloat, listing at a crazy angle. The roughnecks stopped boarding the lifeboats, hoping the boats would not be needed, after all. Then a Cosmosphere hovering above the rig took aim at the corner of the rig which had dipped into the water. A powerful blast from its charged particle beam weapon blew a hole in the partially submerged corner. Immediately, the *Ocean Ranger* heeled over and sank. It went down so fast that it was too late for lifeboats to be launched successfully, and all hands were lost. The freighter *Tarasov* continued on course after sinking the oil rig. The Russians expected that the freighter would be long gone before anyone figured out what had happened - but they miscalculated! At around 2:00 P.M. that same afternoon, Monday, February 15th, an American attack submarine was closing in on the *Tarasov.* The sub fired a single torpedo at the *Tarasov,* hitting it broadside. Water surged in through a giant hole below the waterline, and the freighter started sinking. Like the crew of the Cosmosphere that was shot down over New Jersey, the crew of the *Tarasov* had strict orders to protect the secrets of their ship, and so the Russian captain refused assistance from a nearby Danish freighter as his ship sank with its secrets. Well, Mobil Oil certainly got the message and, just two days later, Mobil Oil shut down the other two oil rigs which had been nearby and towed them ashore. I recommend you take a second look at all the \"oil spill\" accidents that have been happening. END OF PART 8.

PART 9: RUSSIAN COMMAND OF SPACE AND THE MOON On February 5, 1982, Vice President Bush made himself conspicuous by a trip to Cape Canaveral Florida. He was photographed with astronauts inside the European-orbital science laboratory called \"Space Lab.\" It was planned to place Space Lab into orbit by Space Shuttle in late 1983. Bush also announced that Space Shuttle flight No. 3 was scheduled for March 22, 1982. It was supposed to be a week in duration. For public consumption, NASA spokesmen were continuing to pretend that the Shuttle was merely carrying out leisurely test flights. We were told that the Space Shuttle Program was basically a peaceful civilian program in spite of the all-military crews flying the Shuttles. But the peaceful image of the Space Shuttle Program was a total lie. The fact was that the Space Shuttle flights under way were a part of a crash, er, sorry about that, program by the U.S. to regain a military toe-hold in space. The United States had been virtually locked out of the military use of space by the Russians since late 1977. Russia 's domination of space for those prior four years and longer had been highlighted by numerous manned space flights. Those included cosmonauts from nine countries other than Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. went more than five years without admitting to any manned space flight attempts. The Russian, long-duration space spectaculars in Earth orbit were sufficient to build Russia 's prestige in the public eye but the Soviet Space Program involved more than was revealed publicly. Since mid-October 1977, the Moon had been a Russian outpost. There were seven manned long-range particle beam installations on the near side and at least one large base on the far side. In the past, regular missions were flown to and from the Moon in order to resupply the bases and rotate crews, and slowly but surely, the Kremlin was inching its way toward breaking the news about its control of the Moon. They were already beginning to drop hints about it as in the example of a publication circulated in the U.S. called *Soviet Life* in February, 1982. It stated: \"Today spaceships shuttle between the Earth and the Moon with greater frequency than did the first voyages to the New World.\" At the top of the page was a nighttime photo of a moonship ready to blast off from a Russian Cosmodrome. Below was a picture of the Earth as seen from space, and in between was a statement in bold type designed to give another hint about the moon flights which stated, \"From a distance of 70,000 kilometers above the Earth, the planet looks peaceful and even defenseless.

The common goal is to protect our blue and green home.\" Friends, \"satellites\" are not used at altitudes of 70,000 kilometers. The highest orbit that is generally useful for Earth satellites is the geosynchronous orbit for stationary satellites over the equator. Seventy-thousand kilometers is almost twice that far from the Earth. The only time a spacecraft reaches that far from the Earth is when it is on its way to or from the Moon or another planet. Russia 's interest in space extended far beyond military factors. The plans of Russia's new rulers were for the colonization of the solar system. Those plans were moving ahead steadily; in fact, at that time there were two Russian spacecraft approaching the planet Venus and sending back a steady stream of reports from the men aboard. The Russians settled on Venus first, not Mars. It was the first target beyond the Moon for experimental colonization. Now do you better understand the inability of our government to allow a \"Hubble Telescope\" into space? The Russians first started landing unmanned craft on Venus in 1975! They learned some key facts that were yet unknown to the U.S. in 1982 when the Shuttle Program was starting up. In 1978 the Russians began a series of increasing long-duration manned orbital space flights which were widely publicized. Those were gradually extended to six months and more to learn how well crews would stand up to interplanetary space travel. Late in 1981 those long-duration orbital flights were completed. The Russians had learned everything they really needed to know. On October 30 and November 4, 1981, two Russian spaceships blasted off for Venus. Both ships were manned by Russian Cosmonauts, and both were prepared to land on Venus by early February (the first week) of 1982. The comparison between the space program of the U.S. and Russia was a study in tragic ironies. Americans were being told that the Space Shuttle was primarily a civilian-oriented project, but it was actually military. We were being told that it was the world's first reusable spacecraft, but a Shuttle was actually being lost on every flight. We were being told that the Space Shuttle had put us years ahead of Russia , but we had actually slipped years behind.

We were often told that our Rulers wanted only peaceful activities in space, but they were shutting down almost all of the entire civilian scientific space program. Funding was continuing for one or two peaceful projects which were too visible to cancel without an uproar, such as the space telescope. The follow-up on projects to explore the solar system were being lopped off and discarded because they contributed nothing to our leaders' plans for war. We were told that the Russians had nothing but war and conquest on their minds; but it was the Russians, not the Americans, who at that moment had two teams of spacemen ready to land on Venus. They were going there for reasons which had nothing to do with war. The Russians were exploring the land of Venus. They were going there to explore the solar system simply because it was \"out there.\" Russia's new rulers believed that it was man's destiny to move into space. The urge to explore that motivated their Viking ancestors of old was alive and well in the Russian Space Program. The only real prayer of equality for the U.S. was to somehow bring Russia to her knees economically and hence the orchestrated civil wars. I know you will find this hard or impossible to believe. It is time for the truth to come forth. Why don't you try to prove me WRONG? Or better still, why don't you decide to seriously find out for yourself what is going on? You might try reading *SOMEBODY ELSE IS ON THE MOON* by George Leonard, Little, Brown & Co. *Publishers Weekly* said of the book, \"Leonard has been clued by a pseudonymous ex-NASA scientist (his book's *Deep Throat*), and his photos from the 'haunted photo tub of NASA,' are truly mind-boggling when one begins to see what he sees: immense 'rigs' apparently 'mining' the moon; strange 'geometricities,' markings, symbols; lights, evidences of change and movement.\" Or obtain Richard Hoagland's tapes and books such as Hoagland's *Mars, Vol. 3, The Moon-Mars Connection* (...our latest findings on the Moon\"). On February 16, 1982, the Space Shuttle was moved out to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral , five days ahead of schedule. This would be America 's third Shuttle that was being used.

It was replaced by the training Shuttle * Enterprise * which landed at Edwards Air Force Base and was taken to Florida. The * Enterprise * flight in the previous November was simply a stop-gap measure while a third Shuttle could be extensively modified. The new Shuttle at Cape Canaveral was one of the three secret Shuttles from White Sands. It had undergone extensive modification since the first Shuttle disaster ten months prior. It looked the same as the original * Columbia ,* at least from a distance, but the Shuttle was actually far, far different. The Shuttle sitting on the pad was armed \"to the teeth\" for battle. The basic mission of the third Shuttle was the same as that of the first Shuttle's almost a year earlier. Its payload was a heavily armored laser-firing robot battle station designed for space reconnaissance over Russia. Russian space weapons finished destroying all of America 's Spy Satellites nearly four years prior. That meant America 's war planners would be shooting almost blind at Russia if they began a war without somehow acquiring new reconnaissance date. The Space Shuttle was trying to solve that problem by getting a new hardened satellite into orbit. That was what the Space Shuttle flights were all about - attempts at reconnaissance so that nuclear war could be launched. After each Shuttle would take off from Florida it followed a long, swooping curved launch into the north in order to immediately fly over Russia. The American Bolshevik military planners believed that if they could once get their new superspy satellite into orbit, it would do the job. They were confident that it could survive any attacks by Russian space weapons long enough to radio back large amounts of reconnaissance data and once they had that information, the Pentagon would be ready to take America to war. In the spring of 1981, the * Columbia * was destroyed before the Spy Satellite could be deployed. Likewise, the makeshift * Enterprise * mission in November 1981 was a failure, but the military Shuttle planners believed it would be a different story with their Shuttle No. 3 preparing for launch. In the cargo bay of this Shuttle there was a new robot reconnaissance battle station like the one previously described. There was also an additional laser mounted in the forward end of the cargo bay just behind the crew compartment. It was a hydrogen fluoride gas dynamic laser mounted vertically, aimed upward.

There was also an additional laser mounted in the forward end of the cargo bay just behind the crew compartment. It was a hydrogen fluoride gas dynamic laser mounted vertically, aimed upward. It was equipped with a swiveling head consisting of mirrors that could aim the beam around a wide range of angles. The hydrogen fluoride laser in the cargo bay was intended mainly to protect the Shuttle while it climbed toward orbit. The * Columbia * had come under fire shortly prior to reaching orbit. Intelligence analysts in the U.S. had eventually obtained enough information about what happened to decide on installing the cargo bay laser. As a Shuttle climbs, the air grows thinner and thinner, dwindling to almost nothing long before rocket engines shut off. At the earliest possible moment, the modified cargo bay doors which had no hinges on the third Shuttle, would be blown off by special explosives. As the cargo bay doors would flutter away from the Shuttle, it would leave the upper half of the bay open. The cargo bay laser would be ready to fire from that moment onward. It was equipped with the same system called CEIR as previously described. Since a laser thusly equipped successfully shot down a Cosmosphere in January (1982), the Shuttle planners believed the Shuttle would reach orbit safely. Once in orbit planners believed that the main threats to the Shuttle would be Russia 's orbiting Cosmos Interceptors. Those manned killer satellites were responsible for sweeping the skies clear of American Spy Satellites. In order to deal with that threat, there were truly radical modifications to the third Shuttle. Whenever the space Shuttle was discussed, it was always emphasized that Shuttle astronauts could work in their shirt sleeves - no need for space suits because riding in a Shuttle was almost like riding in an airliner. Not so this time. When Col. Jack Lousma and Col. C. Gordon Fullerton would lift off in this Shuttle, they would be in spacesuits. What's more, they would be depending on their spacesuits because their crew cabin would not be pressurized. The whole lower front portion of their ship below the flight deck had been turned into a weapons bay. As soon as the Shuttle would reach orbit, the nose would open up to the vacuum of space, the nose would fold downward and back, somewhat like certain cargo aircraft whose noses fold upward to load and unload. As soon as the nose opened up, a complex laser system would emerge. The system had five tubular sections aimed up, down, to each side, and straight ahead.

Each laser tube had a swiveling mirrorhead for beam aiming like that of the cargo bay laser mentioned earlier. Once deployed, the Nose Laser System would be able to fire in almost any direction, the only exception would be a narrow corridor to the rear of the Shuttle. The Nose Laser System was described as a nuclear punt helium plasma laser with five resonators. The nuclear power pack could fire any one of the five laser tubes at a given time. It was not so powerful as the cargo bay laser but, unlike the cargo bay laser, the Nose Laser System could operate for a long time on an intermittent basis and the Shuttle planners believed it would be powerful enough to disable the manned Russian killer Satellites. Under the protection of the Nose Laser System, Lousma and Fullerton were to deploy the robot Spy Satellite. As soon as it was deployed, they were to return to Earth in a small Gemini-type re-entry capsule. That part of the plan was the same as previously pointed out for the first flight. Meanwhile, the Shuttle would remain in orbit. The Nose Laser System was programmed to keep right on zapping any Russian Cosmos Interceptors that would come within range. It would continue doing so until it would be destroyed or the nuclear laser ran down, which could be a very long time. It would constitute a very dangerous nuisance in space, and the Russians would have little choice but to destroy it. The American Bolsheviks hoped the Russians would lost a lot of spaceships and men before they succeeded in doing so. NUCLEAR WAR NUMBER ONE If the military Shuttle planners were right in their calculation, the third Shuttle mission could turn into a battle royal in space. If they were wrong, they planned to try again. The fourth Shuttle mission was already scheduled for the Fourth of July. After that, no matter what happened with the Space Shuttle, they were planning to go ahead anyway in setting off Nuclear War Number One.

Ever since early spring of the year 1981 this war plan was reported to us, the public, but the big cover-up would sweep over us and it would be buried for no one would listen AND THE BRINGERS OF TRUTH WERE INCARCERATED, PUT UP FOR RIDICULE OR SIMPLY KILLED AND NONE OF THE CITIZENS SEEMED TO NOTICE - WORSE, WE DIDN'T CARE IN THE LEAST TO GET RID OF THOSE \"WARMONGERS.\" The conflicts were intended to gradually escalate until the time would be ripe. Then an American nuclear first strike would be launched against Russia. Nuclear war would break out in such a way that it would appear to be accidental. America 's nuclear forces would not realize that they were firing the first shots of nuclear war. Instead, they would be given false information that would trigger all-out retaliation against a non-existent Russian attack! The prelude to all-out nuclear war was planned to include war in the Middle East. In the joint war plan of the American Bolsheviks and the Israeli military planners, the Middle East war was the responsibility of Israel. This was making Israel the eye of a growing hurricane of violence. The crises continued to expand and grow outward without seeming control. Close to Israel , the top priority was to do everything possible to destroy the Camp David Peace Accords, so called. That is why President Sadat of Egypt was assassinated a few weeks prior (Oct. 6). By early December we were being told that a group of three to six \"hit men\" were thought to be in the United States. It was claimed that they were gunning for the President and several other top Government officials. The U.S. shot down two Libyan jets and killed a child of Khadafy, trying to program him to behave like a madman. These plans were well laid to try to create situations to push us closer to nuclear war.

The old Bolsheviks from Russia who had gained control of America 's military policies had been trying to trigger revolution in Poland. They first attempted to do so by subverting the Roman Catholic Church and already turmoil was stewing in the Vatican. About three years earlier an attempt was made to turn the Catholic Church strongly anti-Russian in its policies. On September 28, 1978, thirty-three days after his election, the newly-elected pope, John Paul II, was murdered by poisoning and yet we are told he died in his sleep. In my February, 1979, issue of *Doomsday Club News & Intelligence Report* newsletter, I said that there was evidence that Pope John Paul I had been murdered and that the Pope who took his place was a KGB agent! Malachi Martin wrote a popular book about the new Pope, *THE KEYS OF THIS BLOOD,* but what you did not know was that Martin was a Jew using a fake name, and THE NEW POPE WAS NOT WHAT HE SEEMED TO BE, EITHER! A book called *IN GOD'S NAME* by David Yallop came out in 1984 with proof of the murder of the previous Pope, and Lawrence Patterson in his newsletter revealed the Jew hoaxer using the name Malachi Martin. For those of you who still have a copy of my newsletter, why don't you check up on me: On page 6 of the February 1979 issue I said, \"The present Pope (Pope John Paul II) will not last very long. I will go on record and emphasize it - *THE PRESENT POPE WILL LAST PROBABLY LESS THAN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS\"* (emphasis copied). Ah, I goofed, you will say, because he is still there. But let me quote from a book called *BLOOD AND ASHES,* a Phoenix Journal, which on page 133 says: \"The Bolsheviks within the Vatican who engineered his election wanted only his potentially anti-Russian image, not the man himself and so he, too, WAS DONE AWAY WITH BY POISONING AND REPLACED BY A 'DOUBLE' ON NOVEMBER 21, 1978. THE NEW 'ACTOR POPE' THEN BEGAN ISSUING A STEADY STREAM OF STIFF STATEMENTS AGAINST ALLEGED RUSSIAN REPRESSION OF POLAND. \"The American Bolsheviks fully planned to use their power in the Vatican to set off what would be known as the 'Pope's Revolution' in Poland...

As can be seen, he is the kind of man who could allow men like Villot, Cody, Marcinkus, Mennini, de Strobel, de Bonis, and Poletti to remain in office. There can be no defense on the grounds of ignorance. Marcinkus is directly answerable to the Pope, and it is inconceivable that the Pope could be unaware of the degree of guilt that clings to Marcinkus.\" Marcinkus, my friends, was a member of the Jewish Mafia in Cicero Illinois who eventually gained control of the Vatican 's BILLIONS (that's dollars) (see book by that name, for instance) and killed the previous pope. Don't you just love religion and preachers? END OF PART 9. PART 10: THE FAKE POPE The fake pope was scheduled to visit Poland to set off a revolution, but Russian Intelligence was able to stop it. Having had their Vatican intrigue spoiled for the moment, the Bolshevik planners in American started down a different route. Their agents within Poland started agitation for an independent labor union to be known as Solidarity. Solidarity was created solely for the purpose of making conditions steadily worse in Poland until an unavoidable confrontation would be created with the government. Eventually they were successful and martial law was declared. The news of martial law in Poland reached the West early Sunday, December 13th (1981). The very next day the Begin government in Israel launched the third Christmas crisis. On that day the Israeli government announced its surprise decision to annex the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is along the northeast corner of Israel 's border with Syria , and is Syrian territory. They have been occupied by Israeli troops ever since the 1967 war and then by Israeli civilian settlements, but under every rule of international law the Golan Heights belongs to Syria. As always, the Begin government defended its actions in arrogantly self-righteous terms as it made a mockery of the rule of law! World-wide, the reaction was universal condemnation of Israel , and within Israel itself there was also bitter criticism. The U.S. was in a most difficult position of what face to show publicly. Time slipped by while urgent secret decisions were made about how to handle the situation publicly. Then, on December 18, the United States half-heartedly announced that it would suspend \"indefinitely\" the allegedly new strategic cooperation agreement with Israel. In response Israel canceled altogether the new agreement with America.

In response Israel canceled altogether the new agreement with America. BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THE U.S. AND ISRAEL STRUCK AN ARM'S-LENGTH POSE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. This was specifically for the purpose of freeing Israel 's hands to act without restraint later on. Israel Prime Minister Rabin summed it up with the words, quote: \"Annexing the Golan Heights is the beginning of the end of ' Camp David '.\" Well, at that time all the plans of the American Bolsheviks and the Zionists in Israel were still on track. They were shooting for Middle East war to break out before the end of the summer of 1982. From there, step by step, they planned to make the conflict escalate with other crises continuing to multiply world-wide. On July 6, 1982 the \"ISRAELI\" government announced that American troops would be sent to Lebanon , if necessary. Hours later, Reagan announced that, \"Yes, in principle, he was prepared to send in the Marines as part of a 'truce agreement'.\" DIRTY POOL For public consumption, assurances were given that this would be done under certain comforting conditions. Supposedly, if the Marines are sent in it will only be temporary to police a truce, not fight, and only if all sides agree to their presence. Doesn't if sound like a rerun - \"We are just there to insure Iraq doesn't invade our little brother, Saudi Arabia ,\" and, \"We are in Haiti only to preserve Democracy.\" Iraq had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia - then or later. Saddam Hussein was 'called in' to Kuwait to protect the interests of the Kuwaitis from being absorbed by the U.S. interests and a collapse brought on by calling of notes following default by the Kuwaitis, to the bankers. Dirty pool. The following day a letter of warning against sending in the Marines was delivered to Reagan from Soviet President Brezhnev. It was a cryptic warning containing no specific threats. In diplomatic language it simply said, \"Don't do it.\" Anti-war warnings from Moscow were becoming increasingly urgent and frequent. On July 7 the Brezhnev warning against sending U.S. Marines into Lebanon was issued, and only six days later the Ustinov warning against an American nuclear first strike was issued.

Does this surprise you? Don't you remember that little tidbit of news? Russia's anti-war warnings included not only words but also deeds, my friends. The Kremlin was run by men who knew that words without deeds were useless against the American Bolsheviks. That is why we were given warnings a month prior to this that Russian preemptive measures must be expected to start taking place. Those pre-preemptive measures got under way promptly, in the form of warning strikes to send a clear, clean message. The first of those warning strikes took place on Sunday morning, June 27 (1982). Millions of Americans watched the launch of Space Shuttle No. 4 that morning on television. You watched until the two solid rocket boosters separated and fell away from the Shuttle. Moments later a Jumbo Cosmosphere, which was pacing the Shuttle from a distance, fired two quick blasts at the falling boosters which were no longer visible on television. The Cosmosphere's beam weapon blew a hole in the side of each $18,000,000 booster shell. An Air Force C-130 airplane was tracking the boosters and saw their parachutes open, but when the spent boosters hit the water they just kept right on sinking. Thanks to the holes which had been neatly blown into their sides - they certainly didn't float. Recovery teams watched helplessly as $36,000,000 worth of space hardware sank in several thousand feet of water. Embarrassed NASA officials tried to explain away the loss of the two Shuttle boosters with the lie that the parachutes did not open (on both of them?). The odds are astronomical against the parachutes failing that way on TWO BOOSTERS, but they had no other excuse that they dared make public. WARNINGS! The *Encyclopedia Brittanica Book of the Year* says of this incident: \"* Columbia 's* fourth launch from Kennedy Space Center was on June 27, with astronauts Thomas K. Mattingly and Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr. Fittingly enough, it landed on July 4 at Edwards Air Force Base in California, greeted by Pres. Ronald Reagan and an estimated 500,000 fellow citizens. A major problem occurred when the two booster rockets plunged into the Atlantic , apparently because of parachute failures. There was no danger to the * Columbia ,* however. Experiments included the first one to be developed by a private company. It was designed to produce certain pharmaceuticals continuously with high purity. The astronauts also helped save the first 'getaway special' when a defective circuit prevented power from reaching the canister.\" Meanwhile, the Russian message was indeed clear.

Had they cared to, the Russians could have destroyed the Shuttle itself on nationwide television, no less, instead of only the boosters. They were saving our government''s \"face\" to use more advantageously during the ensuing years. They certainly have managed to do that very nicely, at our expense. Next came the Aeroflot crash in Moscow followed by the reprisal on July 9 against the Pan Am jet in New Orleans (a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 jet carrying 145 persons crashed in Kenner, LA, shortly after taking off from New Orleans, exploded, and plowed through four residential streets; the accident, which killed 153 persons including 8 on the ground, was the second worst air disaster in U.S. history involving a single plane.) Both events were acts of war - the secret war which both sides were beginning to mention openly in public. The Russian message to the American Bolsheviks here was: \"You are not as secure as you pretend you are.\" Six days later the Russians reminded the Bolsheviks in the U.S. of their combined capabilities in geophysical warfare, a widespread sabotage here. As far back as 1977 we had been warned that the Russians were on a campaign of planting nuclear mines where they could destroy countless dams around the United States. Those devices are still there, waiting for use at the press of a button from a detonator trigger well out of our reach or ability to control. How could subversive workers get within our boundaries without our knowing? They can't There are as many Russian KGB agents in our CIA as Americans. Our government thought, at the time, the mines were a big bluff because it was the Russians themselves who announced their presence to our government. On July 15, 1982, the Kremlin said, \"Think again\" to the Bolshevik pentagon. That day northern Colorado was reeling from incredible rainstorms, the product of Russian weather modification. Dams in the area were straining to hold back the onslaught of water. Then a low-yield underwater mine was detonated at the base of the Lawn Lake Dam. The dam blew open, and the flood waters rampaged down the canyon and through the resort town of Estes Park. The government frantically tried to cover its tracks by saying they had been worried about that dam, but the disaster actually came with absolutely no warning because the dam was ruined instantly by the explosion.

MORE WARNINGS The very next day there was still another Russian warning shot. This time it was couched in the centuries-old language of naval warfare, updated to the Space Age. When confrontations take place at sea there are times when a warship will fire a shot across the bow of another ship. The shot is aimed to barely miss the ship, whistling past just in front of it. A shot across the bow is perhaps the most unmistakable military message on the face of the Earth. It means: \"Halt immediately or you will be destroyed.\" On July 16 a United Airlines DC-10 took off from Boston bound for Los Angeles. Among the passengers of the big jet were certain key members of the Bolshevik ruling group here in America. For a while the flight progressed without incident but as the jet flew westward at 39,000 feet a Russian Cosmosphere was stationing itself to intercept it. The Cosmosphere hovered several miles off to one side of the jet's flight path and a few hundred feet above it. The charged particle beam weapon of the Cosmosphere was aimed horizontally to fire a shot across the bow of the speeding DC-10. As the jet approached, the Cosmosphere crew charged up the beam weapon for a maximum energy blast in a defocused mode. This produces a violent air blast like those heard that winter along America 's East Coast and elsewhere. At precisely the right instant the Cosmosphere fired its shot across the bow of the oncoming DC-10. The tremendous air blast just above the DC-10's altitude created a huge shock wave of downward-racing air. An instant later the DC-10 flew into it. Passengers later told reporters that they heard a big bang, then the whole plane shook as it was squashed downward as if by a giant hand. Everyone not wearing a seat belt was thrown to the ceiling, which is a long way on a DC-10. Many people were hurt, several seriously; then the episode was over as quickly as it had started. The jet flew on to Los Angeles without further incident - but to certain individuals on the plane, the airborne shot across the bow was meant as a clear warning! It certainly meant something to the military and government personnel because they had been warned it would happen. It clearly said, \"Halt now in your war plans or you will be destroyed.\" The next warning shot took place on July 22. This was aimed squarely", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:69:9d6d1934293a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9769, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "quickly as it had started.

It clearly said, \"Halt now in your war plans or you will be destroyed.\" The next warning shot took place on July 22. This was aimed squarely at the weapons specialists among the American Bolsheviks in the U.S. That day the first full-range test flight of the Army's new Pershing-2 missile took place at Cape Canaveral. The Pershing-2 is the nuclear missile which the Reagan Administration wanted to place in Europe where it could attack Russia. Europe would be used as a launching pad. A few seconds after the Pershing-2 lifted off from Cape Canaveral it was bathed in neutron radiation from a Russian Cosmosphere high above. Remember, neutron radiation totally deranges all kinds of electronic equipment. As a result, the Pershing-2's guiding system went crazy. The climbing missile flopped over on its side, then started cartwheeling through the lovely Florida skies. Seventeen seconds after lift-off, the Range Safety Officer pushed the self-destruct button and the missile blew up. The Russian message to the Bolsheviks in the U.S. was very plain indeed. The plans to use missiles to help destroy Russia would not succeed. The attempt to do so would only rain destruction on America itself. END OF PART 10. PART 11: NUCLEAR WAR ONE The Reagan-Begin Axis of Bolsheviks and Zionists intended to manipulate those crises, and more to come, to pave the way for war. Suddenly, certain crises would combine to trigger a chain of events leading to Nuclear War One. The joint military junta of the United States Pentagon and Israel were working on a fast timetable for all of this. They were aiming for deadline time of midsummer 1982 for the final war sequence to begin; fulfillment of the plan was set for September. This would involve regional conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere which gradually would escalate to engulf the superpowers. The whole thing was being set up to make nuclear war appear unavoidable. At last all-out nuclear war itself would break out between the United States and Russia. It would be made to appear accidental, but as we have detailed in the past, Nuclear War One would actually begin with an AMERICAN FIRST STRIKE AGAINST RUSSIA. Up to that point, the secret war planners in the U.S. had been expecting that it would take many months for the final war buildup to run its course. For example, a Mideast war might be triggered by the summer of 1982, but it could take until the spring of 1983 for the resulting nuclear war to actually erupt. That plan had actually been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:70:af770c4f5f03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9770, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "in the past, Nuclear War One would actually begin with an AMERICAN FIRST STRIKE AGAINST RUSSIA.

For example, a Mideast war might be triggered by the summer of 1982, but it could take until the spring of 1983 for the resulting nuclear war to actually erupt. That plan had actually been changed and by winter 1982 drastic changes took place in the secret war planning under way in America. The timetable for Nuclear War One was speeded up by many months in order to render the oncoming winter an ally. This was when the target date was set for mid-September 1982. That was little more than six months from the third Shuttle launch and thus the desperate need for intelligence surveillance information regarding the Soviet Union. Well, then a major intelligence coup was scored by the American Bolsheviks which would allow for fairly accurate targeting. Two high-ranking soviet generals were spirited out of Russia and brought to Washington. Those two men were Bolsheviks whom Russia's new non-Bolshevik rulers failed to detect and weed out. In Intelligence parlance, they remained as \"moles\" in Russia's military apparatus. Now they had been brought to America, and they brought with them a wealth of data about Russia 's current military posture. Thanks to those two former Bolshevik Soviet generals the secret war planners in the U.S. now had enough information. If they could get more data from Space Shuttle flights Nos. 3 and 4, so much the better, but if neither of those two flights was successful, the war planners intended to wait no longer and go with ground intelligence. They wanted to make use of the intelligence obtained from the Soviet generals while it was still fresh and changes could not be made in the Soviet Union who would suspect treason. Therefore, the deadline to attack the Russians was rescheduled. If the U.S. had realized and listened, we would have all realized that the fourth launch was a crossing line to countdown to war. COUNTDOWN TO NUCLEAR WAR I In early 1982 there was a tremendous hidden struggle for power that was dividing the U.S. government. On one side were the American Bolsheviks whose chief government operative was Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. On the other side was the Rockefeller cartel whose chief government spokesman was Secretary of State Alexander Haig. Weinberger and Haig were constantly at each other's throats in the news, and worse, in private. Caught in the middle was the puppet, President Reagan. Reagan was installed by the Rockefeller cartel but came to be largely under Bolshevik control after the assassination \"attempt\" in March of 1981. By February of 1982 the American military was dominated by the Bolsheviks, but that had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:71:a6aca0329f2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9771, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "the other side was the Rockefeller cartel whose chief government spokesman was Secretary of State Alexander Haig.

Reagan was installed by the Rockefeller cartel but came to be largely under Bolshevik control after the assassination \"attempt\" in March of 1981. By February of 1982 the American military was dominated by the Bolsheviks, but that had not always been so. By 1982 a plan for a Rockefeller cartel-backed military coup was being set in motion (again) and this time it was a crash program. The Rockefeller cartel could not afford to let their Bolshevik enemies succeed in setting off nuclear war; therefore, the military coup must take place before the American Bolshevik surprise attack against Russia. If possible, the coup would be carried out before the fourth Space Shuttle flight planned for the summer of 1982, because the war was scheduled immediately following that flight. The man who was in charge of the military coup preparations was a four-star Army General who was also Secretary of State - General Alexander Haig. If you remember the Falkland Islands War occurred about this time and the Bolsheviks foiled the coup. Haig was fired and Bolshevik George P. Shultz took his place, on June 25th. FALKLANDS WAR You need to know the facts behind the Falkland Islands War, the shooting of the *U.S.S. Liberty* by the Israelis, the turmoil in Central America, developments towards the Iran-Iraq war, Libya's Kadhafi, Afghanistan, Poland, etc. Things were and are not as you think they are, friends! I have mentioned about doubles. For example, on March 6 the BBC quoted a *London Times* article questioning whether or not Khomeini was still alive. The article expressed suspicions that fake pictures were being used showing the \"double\" for Khomeini. HOW MANY FINGERS DO YOU SEE? I remember, I believe, the article was in *Reader's Digest,* an article that said that when Khomeini went into exile to Paris, he was missing a finger. When he later returned to Iran , Khomeini was not missing any fingers. Khomeini was quite a miracle worker, don't you think? Or could somebody be pulling a fast one? The Reagan-Begin Axis, in cahoots with their Zionist partners in Israel , were going all out to try to start a nuclear war. The Manhattan Project went from a decision to make the bomb (on the day before Pearl Harbor in December 1941), to a working bomb exploded on Hiroshima in August, 1945. And this was before computers. In 1982, a new program was started similar to the Manhattan Project. It was called the \"Stealth\" program, and, surprise, surprise, it succeeded the same year!

It succeeded because of the immense computing power of the Control Data Corporation Star 100 and Cray computers (an offshoot of Control Data). The most secret branch of the Stealth Program was developing aircraft that would be invisible to more than just radar. They must be invisible even to the eye. These invisible \"Phantom\" war planes would carry special electromagnetic gear. You see, there was already the capability, for Russia had the know-how to cause the Cosmos Interceptors and Cosmospheres to be invisible. All that was really needed was to get defectors and most defectors had a \"price\" under which they will bargain. The equipment included superconducting magnets which were maintained at temperatures close to absolute zero. The cryogenic equipment creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field around the aircraft. The field is designed according to the principles of Einstein's \"Unified Field Theory.\" Einstein never completely finished his Field Theory, but it was studied by numerical techniques using the Star 100 and Cray computers and others and integration became a simple game. By this method, enough could be learned, coupled with stolen information, to apply the Unified Field Theory to the new \"Phantom\" war planes. Think of the magnificent possibilities. Time is a function of the measurement of movement of \"things\" - atoms, matter, and stuff. At absolute zero, atoms stop moving. Time stops. When atoms speed up in relation to surroundings, time speeds up. Frequency is everything. When you understand the rules, wondrous things are possible. For hints of the possibilities, study the Philadelphia Experiment and Project Montauk. Read *A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME* by Stephen Hawking or *HYPERSPACE, A SCIENTIFIC ODYSSEY THROUGH PARALLEL UNIVERSE, TIME WARPS, AND THE 10TH DIMENSION* by Michio Kaku. This is why the government must keep the Stealth aircraft a \"national security\" secret. They have revealed the part of the secret telling that the shape of the surfaces affects the radar signature, to explain the strikes in Iraq and so on, but they don't want you to know the rest of the secrets. By revealing this much, they kept the Stealth program from being scuttled by Congress. Under this program they can send 22 planes into battle, and 22 planes return. Mission accomplished!

Under this program they can send 22 planes into battle, and 22 planes return. Mission accomplished! You do not see all the others that also went into battle, and those that are lost are made up for so that you see the same number return. When the invisibility field would be turned on, a \"Phantom\" war plane would be encased in a sort of electromagnetic bubble. Light that strikes the field from any direction divides, passes around the plane, comes together again on the other side, and goes on. The effect is like a boulder in a stream - water flowing toward the boulder divides, goes around it and then comes together again on the other side. When you \"see\" something, light bounces off the object and strikes your eyes. Your eyes then recognize the pattern. If something comes between you and the object, you can no longer see it. But if the light from the object goes around the obstruction, you see the original object, but not the obstruction. This is how Phantom planes work, although up close they can be dimly detected, while farther away they are totally invisible. Do you now understand why so many \"UFO\" sightings are blurry? Radar behaves the same way as light, it just has a different wavelength, so Phantom planes are invisible to both light and radar, unless they turn off their fields. This explains some of the reported sonic booms where there was no visible airplane. The Russians, however, can see through these fields using sophisticated infrared beam detectors. Phantom war planes are totally immune to lasers because a laser is just a beam of intense light. An invisibility field also would give protection against the Russian Particle Beam system in tracking ability but the plan backfired because the Russians had already developed anti-invisible shield technology. Ordinarily, charged particles are far easier to deflect than light, so the charged particle beam is no match for the light-deflecting shield. Ah, but when you get into pulsed neutron beams - you have a real handful of troubles. And so that leaves only neutron beam weapons. Russia's neutron beam would penetrate the invisibility shield, but ways were thought to have been found to shield against neutron radiation well enough to make neutron beams ineffective in stopping a Phantom war plane. This was conceived as true because extremely effective shielding would be part of the basic design of the Phantom war plane whereby the plane would have to first be \"located\" in order to be fired upon. The basic design would require such sophisticated shielding in order to prevent derangement of the electronic instruments as well as the crew, if it were a manned craft.

So the result of the program would be craft which would be undetectable by conventional means, and it was believed to be invulnerable to all of Russia's beam weapons. Those beam weapons had been the key to Russia's military superiority since late 1977, so the Phantom war plane was the hope-for weapon to attack Russia in the upcoming planned nuclear strike. The Phantom war plane had one recognized major drawback. In a way, its greatest strength would also be its greatest weakness. When the invisibility field would be turned on, incoming light waves would not strike the plane; instead, the light flows around the plane. That is what makes the plane invisible to observers at a distance but, at the same time, the field prevents light waves from the outside world from reaching the cockpit of the plane. In other words, the pilot cannot see anything outside the invisibility field. He is required by physical law to fly blind. There was only one technique known in the West by which a Phantom war plane could be navigated. It is called \"Inertial Guidance,\" a technique used for ICBMs. In Inertial Guidance, a computerized system keeps track of all the forces and maneuvers experienced by the vehicle. By adding these up over time, the system calculates where it is without reference to the outside world. For a Phantom war plane, the Inertial Guidance problem is very difficult. The guidance system must operate for as long as several hours while the plane flies to its target. That gives lots of time for errors to build up which would send the plane off course, but the problem was thought to be solved sufficiently to utilize the Phantom planes in the attack. New Inertial Guidance technology had been developed using lasers in place of the old mechanical gyros used in ICBMs, and so the supersecret Phantom war plane project had basically succeeded in concept - and, for all intents and purposes, we now had a new superweapon. It was revolutionary, prototypes were flying and a rush production program was already under way by the early 1980s. The secret war planners expected to have an operational fleet ready by summer, 1982. This was the \"pacing item\" in the short war timetable.

When Phantom war planes would take off to attack Russia, they would have to know ahead of time exactly where the target would be. Therefore, for a year the Space Shuttle had been making a desperate attempt to obtain the needed target information from space. It would be the first new data since Russia destroyed our Spy Satellites in 1978. The first two Shuttle flights were NOT successful in their secret military mission, but in February, 1982, Shuttle No. 3 was more successful. The war planners now obtained the most crucial target data needed for a Phantom war plane attack against Russia. As a result, a whole new war plan was being prepared for the coming planned nuclear war. America 's war strategists were eager for war because they believed they could achieve victory over Russia - the concept of victory, however, DID NOT INCLUDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE SECRET WAR STRATEGISTS WERE PREPARING TO SACRIFICE AMERICA AND MOST OF HER PEOPLE ON THE ALTAR OF WORLD DOMINATION - AND ONLY THE TIME AND PLACE HAS CHANGED. END OF PART 11. PART 12: WAR STRATEGY The radically new Phantom war plane caused an equally radical revision of the master war strategy of the U.S. Elements of several past strategies were being blended together to create a new and grander plan. It was the new grand master strategy which America 's war planners were counting on to bring them victory in Nuclear War One, and they planned to use the war plan very quickly - by Autumn of 1982, with or without the proper surveillance hoped for by Shuttle flight No. 3. Strategic nuclear war planning in Washington was being carried out under the code name \"Project Z.\" The letter \"Z\" was chosen because it is the final letter of the alphabet. The war planners were confident that this would be the last war plan they would need against Russia. War planning under Project Z was so secret that it was not being done at the Pentagon itself; instead, an elite group of war strategists were assembled at a special war room in downtown Washington. The war room was hidden away in a building which would never be suspected for the purpose. It was practically within the shadow of the White House.

The elite war planners for Nuclear War One were a very small group. Their job was to think in terms of the big overall picture. They had at their fingertips computer terminals with which they could access any information they needed from other government computers (using PROMIS software stolen from Inslaw, for instance). This included not only Pentagon data banks but also the computer files of all other government agencies. By May the Project Z planners had already arrived at the broad outlines for their master war plan. Countless details and refinements still lay ahead, but the basic strategy was already decided. That strategy bears looking at herein. The Project Z strategy for Nuclear War One was a three-phase plan - that is, the war planners intended for the war to proceed in three distinct phases known as: Phase 1 - Initiation; Phase 2 - Attrition; and Phase 3 - Domination. The major process was based on ever-increasing world crises, like those that led up to World War I. We were seeing that process in full swing all around us. It was planned that these crises escalate for about six additional months and finally the spark would be set off. The Project Z war planners were concerned with the military acts from that initial spark onward. Phase Number One: In their plan, the Initiation Phase would begin with an American surprise attack against Russia. The surprise attack would use the new Phantom war planes. They would be the key to the outcome of the rest of the war. In the summer of 1978 America had begun major shifting to a first-strike nuclear strategy against Russia. It would be a first strike. It would be to knock out the Earth bases for Russia 's space triad of strategic weapons. If that could be done, Russia 's overwhelming military power in space would soon wither and perish. That would leave the U.S. and Russia on more equal terms for the rest of the war. The plan was to use a combination of Subcraft and Unmanned Aircraft called RPVs for the initial attack. That plan was actually attempted some two years prior but ended in total failure because Subcraft of RPVs were no match for Russia 's Cosmospheres with their beam weapons, but the new Phantom war planes were almost ready and the plan was being revived in updated form. Phantom war planes were intended to be based in at least three countries on Russia's doorstep. These basing areas were: northern Norway; eastern Turkey; and most critical of all, Sinkiang Province in northwestern China.

These basing areas were: northern Norway; eastern Turkey; and most critical of all, Sinkiang Province in northwestern China. Now you know why Reagan and others became so cozy with China! Already, high-powered lasers were being moved into those areas. They were equipped with the new aiming device called CEIR (see-er). Those lasers had the proven ability to shoot down Cosmospheres. They would be used to protect the Phantom war planes from destruction on the ground by Cosmospheres. The Phantom war planes which would be used were unmanned. They were equipped with robot pilots which would be programmed for a one-way trip. The invisible robot pilot and aircraft would fly through Russian air space, invulnerable to any beam-weapon attacks. Anti-aircraft missiles fired at them would be unable to home in on them, and so the Project Z planners believed that the robot Phantom planes would reach their targets. Those targets were Russia's four Cosmodromes for rockets plus several Cosmosphere installations in central Siberia. The invisible robot planes would crash like kamikazes into their targets. Seemingly out of the clear blue sky, all of Russia 's space bases would suddenly vanish in thermonuclear fireballs. In addition to Russia's space bases, the Phantom war plane assault would also be directed at one other category of prime targets. These were the bases for Russia's flying Anti-missile System. The system consisted of a fleet of TU-144 Supersonic Transports equipped with particle-beam weapons. They were supposed to provide Russia's final line of defense against incoming missile warheads. American Phantom war planes would be programmed to destroy the TU-144 bases. Phase #1 was continuing on a very tight timetable by May, 1982. If the invisible war plane attack would succeed, a furious counterattack by Russia was guaranteed. Project Z called for the U.S. to beat Russia to the punch. The entire U.S. nuclear arsenal was to be fired at Russia. It would be done by creating the false indication that America was under nuclear attack. The method which would be employed was known as Electromagnetic Pulse or EMP. EMP is a phenomenon associated with nuclear blasts at the fringes of space. The strategic forces were programmed to consider an EMP episode to be positive proof of a Russian attack. Under those circumstances, they were instructed to counterattack against Russia without waiting for any further orders.

In the Project Z timetable, the Phantom was plane explosions in Russia would be followed moments later by nuclear detonations over North America. These would be the warheads of American high-speed missiles called ACMs. They would be launched into the sky from various locations around the U.S. to create a violent EMP episode. The Strategic/Nuclear Forces, obeying orders, would launch what they would believe to be a retaliation against Russia. As the American ACMs would be launched into the sky over our heads, still another event was to be underway. Keep in mind the episode of January, 1982, whereby a Russian Cosmosphere had been shot down for the fist time - over New Jersey. In the same way, high-power lasers located in many places around the U.S. would be shooting down as many Cosmospheres as possible. By the time our ICBMs were launched a few minutes later, it could be expected that many of the threatening Cosmospheres overhead would have been destroyed. They would be unable to blast all of our missiles as they were launched, and many would survive to be on their way to Russia. Thanks to the initial Phantom war plane attack, Russia 's flying ABM system would also be out of action. Stripped of all her defenses against missile attack, the Soviet Union would soon be aflame with a sea of nuclear firestorms. In the Project Z war plan, the arrival of American ICBMs on Russian targets would mark the end of Phase #1, the Initiation Phase. PHASE TWO: THE ATTRITION PHASE Phase Number Two: This is the Attrition Phase. During Phase #2 the war planners envisioned extreme damage to both the U.S. and to Russia , with the war gradually running down. First there would be a rain of Russian missile warheads on the U.S. There would also be missile attacks on certain other targets around the world where American Military Forces were located, but the real destruction would be right in the U.S. itself. The Project Z war planners did not expect America , as you know it, to survive a nuclear exchange. Unlike Russia , the U.S. has no Civil Defense worthy of the name, let alone hardened blast shelters and, because of the need for total surprise in the attack against Russia 's space bases, the ensuing nuclear exchanges would come without warning. Vacationers would be on beaches, businessmen would be making deals, housewives would be in supermarkets, children would be at play, etc. In my July 1978 newsletter I warned that it was the policy of the U.S. to NOT warn its population.

Suddenly air raid sirens might start to blare, as they would do so on a summer day in Hiroshima years ago, but it would be too late. The America you know and love would die in a thousand Hiroshimas. The war schemers have planned for all that and have only updated the plans to suit changes in happenings TODAY. While you and your children vanish from the face of the Earth, they fully intended and still intend to be riding out any attack they have caused, inside Government war bunkers build with your taxpayer money, at Camp David, Mount Weather , Pine Gap, China Lake and DOZENS of other locations. Do you have your passes to these places? I thought not. 4 OF 5 AMERICANS TO DIE Gradually, over a period of many months, they fully expected the conflict between Russia and the U.S. to sputter out. Both sides would be exhausted and ruined; both would lose the capacity to carry the war any further. In Russia , the wound would be grievous - up to 50 million dead and millions more injured and dying. BUT IN THE U.S. THE WOUND WOULD BE MORTAL. The Project Z war planners had figured it out on their computers. If we were lucky, from 40 to 50 million Americans might survive at the end of the war. All the rest would have been killed outright in the nuclear attacks or would have died of injuries and disease. Nuclear War One would leave medical care virtually nonexistent in what would be left of America. The American Bolsheviks intended to ride out the war after setting it off. They would wait until the stalemate point would be reached with both sides unable to fight any longer. That would mark the end of Phase #2, the Attrition Phase. PHASE THREE: FINAL Phase Number Three: Finally, the Project Z war plan would move into the third and final phase. That phase, of course, would be world domination by the SATANIC BOLSHEVIKS/ZIONISTS (PARASITES) who already controlled and control the U.S. military. In the final phase as planned for 1982, the Bolsheviks/Zionists in America would be taking advantage of secret preparations which began long, long prior.

One arm of the prior plan had been strategy which required the U.S. to give the impression that it was growing steadily weaker, disarming unilaterally, closing military bases, and so on, but that was only for public consumption. The secret side of the strategy involved an actual buildup of armaments, in secret. This necessitated a secret government, which was set up by Jimmy Carter, Oliver North, George Bush, et al., under the smokescreen of FEMA - the Federal Emergency Management Agency. When the Bolsheviks/Zionists in the U.S. seized power from the Rockefellers, they continued the stockpiling of secret reserves of armaments world-wide, and especially in Israel. It was well planned that as the war began to sputter, all these armaments would be brought into the open. Even if the entire populations of the U.S. and Russia were destroyed, that would still leave 95% of the world's population alive, and under total domination of the \"Elite.\" Both the Bolsheviks and the Zionists despise and loathe both the Russians and the Americans and world domination could only come to the bankers and global cartel through massive damage and/or destruction to both major powers. Where does all this leave our ally Great Britain ? Could it be they plan to survive free and clear in domination of the world? On March 30, 1982, one day behind schedule, we got to see a Shuttle landing at the White Sands Missile Range New Mexico. White Sands is the true nerve center of the Space Shuttle Program, regardless of what the media tells you otherwise. The third Shuttle flight, regardless of which Shuttle did what, represented another \"first\" and that one was not visible on television. For the first time a Space Shuttle had succeeded in its secret military mission. By so doing, another barrier was removed in the path to nuclear war. The third Shuttle mission took place nearly a year after the first flight of April, 1981. A comparison between the first and third flights is a study in ironies. In the April fiasco, publicity about the first flight was designed to give the impression that it was unnaturally perfect. Meanwhile, the secret military mission - which you did not see - was a disaster. With the third flight, it was the other way around. From start to finish the publicity emanating from NASA gave the impression that the Shuttle was plagued with problems.

TROUBLES Space Shuttle No. 3 was supposed to orbit a special new Spy Satellite. It was hardened against attack from Russia 's space weapons and armed with a robot-controlled laser that could shoot back. In addition, the Shuttle itself was armed with lasers on this third try. The public image of a troubled, plagued Shuttle flight actually got underway several days prior to launch, thanks to the weather. Drenching rainstorms turned Edwards Air Force Base in California, used for the prior two landings, into a wet bog. The tight military schedule of the Shuttle Program required that the flight take off on schedule anyway, so for public consumption a 23-car railroad train loaded with equipment was sent from California to New Mexico. Ostensibly, NASA was setting up a spur-of-the-moment landing site at the White Sands Missile Range. This was done so that the central role of White Sands Missile Range in the Shuttle Program would not be suspected by the public and would also delete the need for substitute Shuttles in the landing itself because it is publicly closed. Space Shuttle No. 3 lifted off from Cape Canaveral only an hour behind schedule on Monday morning, March 22nd. Beginning at the moment of liftoff, NASA started laying the basis for a cover-up story should the military mission fail. First you heard the pre-recorded voice of Shuttle Commander Jack Lousma saying unexplained white flakes were flying past the windshield. Later, after the Shuttle was out of sight, we were told that one of the power packs called an APU was not functioning. These initial hints of possible trouble had been pre-recorded for broadcast during the launch - for a reason. There was fear that the Shuttle might be destroyed by Russian space weapons before reaching orbit altitude. Had that happened, the Shuttle managers wanted to be able to initiate a cover-up which would not reveal the military situation; but as it turned out, the preparations paid off and, through the radical new maneuver already discussed, the Shuttle did at least reach proper altitude. When the Shuttle No. 3 took off, it headed into the northeast. Long-distance cameras followed it until the two solid rockets separated and fell away. Then, as the Shuttle disappeared from sight, it started its long sweeping turn into the north. It was heading toward a near-polar orbit so that it would pass", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:82:1a77f3408bb2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9782, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "military situation; but as it turned out, the preparations paid off and, through the radical new maneuver already discussed, the Shuttle did at least reach proper altitude.

Then, as the Shuttle disappeared from sight, it started its long sweeping turn into the north. It was heading toward a near-polar orbit so that it would pass over Russia. This much of the flight plan was the same as in the past, but this time a critical new feature was added. Less than 30 seconds after the Shuttle disappeared from TV cameras, the cargo-bay doors were blasted completely off. This opened up a field of fire for the defensive laser at the front of the cargo bay. Then the Shuttle and its giant external tanks started rotating slowly in a space-age version of a barrel-roll. In World War II, fighter pilots made use of the barrel roll to avoid bullets from enemy airplanes. Likewise, the Space Shuttle used a barrel roll to protect itself against probable attack from Russian Cosmospheres. By rotating like a corkscrew, the Shuttle made it impossible for a Cosmosphere to approach safely from any direction. The barrel roll maneuver was a very risky one, however, for the Shuttle. The Shuttle and tank were not designed with \"aerobatics\" in mind but calculations showed that it should survive a slow roll, and somehow it did. One of the biggest questions about the barrel roll stunt was what it would do to the astronauts Lousma and Fullerton. They were required to withstand these dizzying gyrations for about six minutes. At the same time, the Shuttle was still accelerating with up to three times the force of gravity; and because of the peculiar design of the Shuttle and fuel tank, the gyrations were sickening indeed. Military space doctors knew that at best Lousma and Fullerton would be very sick for some time after reaching this low orbit. Their wild, bruising, spinning ride would end abruptly in weightlessness. That is a combination guaranteed to derange the equilibrium of even the toughest astronaut. Nothing remotely like it has ever been done. Doctors were rightly worried that even if the two survived the mission and returned to Earth, there could be permanent damage to their equilibrium. When orbit was reached, they did indeed become violently ill. That is why you heard those reports about nausea striking both men. NASA wanted to pave the way for a plausible public explanation if they should not appear well when they returned to Earth. At the same time, the Shuttle planners knew perfectly well why they were sick. That is why NASA spokesmen acted so unconcerned when discussing the space sickness with reporters. When they called it \"motion sickness,\" they were making a gross", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:83:6ad0583b649e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9783, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "they did indeed become violently ill.

At the same time, the Shuttle planners knew perfectly well why they were sick. That is why NASA spokesmen acted so unconcerned when discussing the space sickness with reporters. When they called it \"motion sickness,\" they were making a gross understatement. Lousma and Fullerton were to begin work immediately upon reaching proper orbit - sick or not. Their extensively modified crew compartment was to be depressurized already - automatically - with the two men depending upon their space suits. This plan had to be modified slightly when the barrel roll was added to the flight plan. HARD ON THE CREW When the Shuttle reached orbit the astronauts were in space suits, but the cabin was still pressurized. They were allowed several minutes to get from the flight deck to the Gemini-type escape capsule stored below. Once inside the escape capsule they then depressurized the cabin; then the Nose Laser System deployed automatically to protect the Shuttle against any attacks by Russian space weapons. This allowed Lousma and Fullerton to recover from space sickness while inside the capsule. For the ensuing two days or so, getting well was their main task. It was a period of total vulnerability, of depending on the untried Automatic Laser System for protection. The Shuttle planners wanted to have the excuse ready later should the Shuttle be attacked and destroyed. So the day after the launch you were shown TV pictures of missing tiles on the nose of the Shuttle. According to those pictures at least a dozen tiles in the black area were lost. If that had really happened, it would have been cause for extreme alarm. Later a NASA spokesman downplayed it, saying the tiles were noncritical. But there is no such thing as a noncritical black tile. The black tiles supposedly lost are to withstand temperatures above 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. Under th tile there is nothing but a piece of felt called a \"strain isolation pad\" which would not last five seconds in those temperatures, and under the felt is the metal skin of the Shuttle. It is made of aluminum, which loses its strength above 350 degrees. If exposes to 1500 degree heat by a few missing tiles, the Shuttle could not possibly avoid very severe, crippling damage or destruction by rupturing. PRE-RECORDED HOAX The nice NASA space movies we saw on TV were a pre-recorded hoax to provide an excuse if something went wrong, but it didn't.

The astronauts recovered, went to work, and deployed the new military satellite. Meanwhile, NASA spokesmen waved aside the alleged tile problem as minor. It had served its purpose and was no longer needed. Throughout the remainder of the week we heard about one problem after another. Supposedly the cargo bay doors would not close and I guess not, since they were blown completely away, the toilet would not work, three out of four communications channels went out, one of the three crucial data display screens in the cockpit failed, etc. None of these stories was true; all were devised to provide blather material and cover story for possible problems with the secret military mission. But in the end none of them was needed and so NASA spokesmen just waved them aside as unimportant. The secret military mission was a success, so the pretended mission which was cooked up for TV was declared an overwhelming success, also. END OF PART 12. PART 13: Late Friday night, March 26th (1982), Lousma and Fullerton finished deploying the new Superspy Satellite. It had taken longer than planned, but it was done. The Shuttle was left in orbit. The astronauts re-entered their Gemini-type escape capsule, fired its retrorockets, and dropped out of orbit to an Indian Ocean splashdown. From there they were flown nonstop to the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The Shuttle directors took advantage of a sandstorm at White Sands to delay the public landing for an extra day while the astronauts recuperated. Then the next morning they boarded one of the two remaining secret Shuttles at White Sands. The Shuttle took off from the north end of the immense White Sands Range, using small solid rockets. Just moments before 11:00 A.M. it made its appearance on TV. They swooped in from the north, dropped down over the mountains, and touched down in a cloud of white dust. Finally, after a respectable wait, out stepped Lousma and Fullerton all rested and refreshed. On Memorial Day, May 30, 1982, Richard Halloran leaked the existence of Project Z in an article in the *New York Times.* The article said: \"PENTAGON DRAWS UP FIRST STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING A LONG NUCLEAR WAR. Defense Department policy makers in a new five-year defense plan have accepted the premise that nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union could be protracted, and have drawn up their first strategy for fighting such a war.\" It did not say, however, that the plans were to launch the war in three months.

Defense Department policy makers in a new five-year defense plan have accepted the premise that nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union could be protracted, and have drawn up their first strategy for fighting such a war.\" It did not say, however, that the plans were to launch the war in three months. The article went on to mention that the plan was laid out in an unpublished document of 125 pages. It was drafted for approval by a man who served Satan directly, Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger. Caspar Weinberger is a most interesting guy, but his story is so mind-boggling that I will have to save it for some other time. The U.S. Pentagon was controlled by the Bolsheviks who formerly controlled Russia. Weinberger was the highest *visible* agent of the Bolsheviks in the U.S. government at that time. BITTER RIVALS: WHY ROCKEFELLERS HAD TO BE TAKEN OUT The nuclear war plan of the Bolsheviks was moving most quickly, but the U.S. Government was a house divided. The Bolsheviks were opposed by their bitter rivals, the Rockefeller cartel. Their top visible operative in the federal government at the time was Secretary of State Alexander Haig. The often visible feuding between Haig and Weinberger was only a pale shadow of that deadly power struggle behind the scenes. Unlike the Bolsheviks, the Rockefeller factions did not want nuclear war. In a word, they couldn't \"afford\" it. They would lose everything, and so the Rockefeller faction was working feverishly to head off the Bolshevik nuclear war plan. The new anti-Bolshevik rulers of Russia were also against nuclear war. The anti-Bolshevik, anti-nuclear war attitudes of the Rockefeller cartel and the Kremlin led to a limited coalition between them. The most spectacular result from this Rockefeller-Russian coalition was the Falklands War raging between Argentina and Britain. The Falklands was the visible aftermath to cover warfare which took place during April, 1982. The Rockefeller cartel and the Russians joined forces to destroy certain military installations and weapons reserves. These were key ingredients in the final phase of the Project Z war plan. The whole operation began at South Georgia Island on April 3. With the help of Argentina a joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team was able to knock out the giant hidden naval base there. The base, built during the 1960s, was originally controlled through the U.S. Government by the Rockefeller cartel but the Bolsheviks acquired control of the bases in the late 1970s when they also seized control of the American Pentagon. The major base was contained within a giant man-made cavern hollowed out inside a mountain near the water. With the camouflaged ship entrances sealed, the base was bombproof, but the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team succeeded in attacking the base by drilling a shaft through the mountain. Then a compact Russian neutron", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:86:0b429af4199f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9786, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "through the U.S. Government by the Rockefeller cartel but the Bolsheviks acquired control of the bases in the late 1970s when they also seized control of the American Pentagon.

With the camouflaged ship entrances sealed, the base was bombproof, but the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team succeeded in attacking the base by drilling a shaft through the mountain. Then a compact Russian neutron bomb was inserted through the shaft and detonated inside the cavernous naval base. The process took several weeks. The Thatcher government which - like the U.S. government - was Bolshevik controlled, dispatched the Royal Navy. First, it was supposed to dislodge the heavily-armed Rockefeller-Russian military force before it could destroy the naval base, then it was to move on to the Falklands for the publicly-admitted fighting. The Royal Navy arrived several days too late to save the secret base on South Georgia Island. But by that time the panicking Thatcher government had already committed some two-thirds of the Royal Navy to the South Atlantic. On top of that, at least one British ship had already been sunk by Russia in connection with the secret South Georgia operation. That left the Thatcher government with no choice but to engage Argentina in battle, otherwise it would have been impossible to explain away Britain's huge deployment to the South Atlantic, much less the heavy losses which had been sustained. On April 30 the British blockade of the Falklands was just beginning. Later that day President Reagan announced that the U.S. was actively siding with Britain. The announcement was a victory for the Pentagon war faction. Right away warfare around the Falklands started heating up quickly. On May 1, the British launched bombing raids against the airport at Port Stanley, and on May 2 a British submarine torpedoed Argentina's second largest ship, the cruiser *General Belgrano.* It sank within 24 hours, leaving a death toll of more than 300 Argentine sailors. The sinking of the *Belgrano* was expected to demoralize the Argentines, but instead it enraged them. The *Belgrano* had been sunk at a time when it was not threatening the British forces. The Argentines decided it was time to start playing their ace-in-the-hole against the British. Argentina had been given certain promises in return for making the secret South Georgia operation possible. One of these was the promise of covert military assistance by Russia against Britain. Specifically, it was pledged that the Russians would intervene in parallel with Argentine air and naval operations in ways designed to even the odds. In this way Argentina's military leaders could take full credit for both their own and covert Russian attacks on the British.

At the same time, the procedure was designed to keep Russia's role in the fighting quite obscure. I simply do not have time to go into what the real truth was about the Falklands War, just suffice to say that what you were told was worlds away from the truth. On August 24, 1982, another Cosmosphere was blasted out of the sky over the New York City vicinity, to be sure the New Jersey shot event could be duplicated. It created a high-speed fireball, described in the *New York Times* as a possible asteroid burning up. When the American Phantom war planes would be launched into Russia on Z-Day, they would be swarming toward only six primary and about a dozen secondary targets. The six primary targets were the Russian Space bases, four Cosmodromes at Baikonur, Tyuratam, Plesetsk, and Kaspusin Yar, and two Cosmosphere facilities at Semipalatinsk and Novosibirsk. As for the dozen or so secondary targets, those were the complex of Russian flying ABM bases. The system consisted of anti-missile particle beam weapons carried aboard converted TU-144 Supersonic Transports. The Transports were mysteriously removed from service in June 1978 for conversion to anti-missile defense but by September 1982 the system was fully operational. The intent was to knock them all out, if possible, to make the American follow-up attack more devastating. Some other \"stuff\" came down about then, also. It was determined that if the strike against those bases failed, the war plan was doomed. There was only one satisfactory geographic location from which to launch a strike against the Russian Cosmosphere areas and that location was Sinkiang Province, China. The Bolsheviks must have access to Sinkiang Province at all costs it was decided - so - the Carter Administration unexpectedly dumped Taiwan on December 15, 1978, and suddenly announced full diplomatic relations with Peking. END OF THE WORLD PLANNED FOR THE \"END OF THE WORLD\" WAS SET FOR 3:00 P.M. E.D.T., FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1982. This was the second date set to launch Nuclear War One (the first in late January of 1980 had been postponed). This date, by the way, WAS THE \"FEAST OF TRUMPETS.\" At EXACTLY 3:01 P.M. E.D.T. all of Russia would be in darkness. When the Indian Ocean Satellite signal would arrive confirming the attack, it would be followed within a minute or so by the EMP episode described above.

If you were watching TV or listening to the radio, there would suddenly be horrendous static and possibly permanent damage to the receivers. There would have been a total power blackout and the telephones would have gone dead. Russian short-range underwater launched missiles were planted along OUR shores and in the Great Lakes in 1976 and 1977 (and are still there). We would have had from 24 to 10 minutes to live depending on how far from the launchers we would be. In addition, Russia had Moon bases and Cosmospheres overhead, both armed with their charged particle beam weapons. So what happened? The Superspy Satellite launched in March 1982 by the third Shuttle had detected something most puzzling in Russia. The puzzle consisted of large numbers of small domed installations arranged in rings around strategic Russian targets. There was a ring of those domes around each Cosmodrome and around each Comosphere Base in particular. They were obviously defensive weapons of some sort. There were heated discussions about what they might be. Actually, they were Rail Guns. I shall not spend more time on them, if you want to know more, do your own research. The information is available to the public. For now, I will just say the Rail Guns cannot be deflected by electronic defenses. Because of the arguments over the uncertainty of success, the attack was called off five hours before launch time. It was rescheduled. IT WAS RESCHEDULED FOR FEAST OF TRUMPETS, ROSH HASHANAH, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1990. This last one was also rescheduled and that date also passed. The time was again reset for a later date for the launch of Nuclear War One. Guess for when the new date was set? Please review the first paragraph of this paper. I will copy it for you here: \"As I begin writing this report, the news is telling about a strange USAIR airplane crash in Pennsylvania. Next day a plane crashed in Moscow. CNN told about a fireball that was reported from Bakersfield, California, to Medford, Oregon. They said it occurred about 6 or 6:15 in the morning on SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 10 (1994) and was so bright that the light shining through windows woke up some people. They showed a house in San Rafael with a hole in the roof from a piece of something falling from the sky. An Ariane rocket was launched from French Guyana and was LOST, a day before.

Several earthquakes have occurred in California, including one that CNN showed on a map, southwest of Lake Tahoe. About 15 minutes later, CNN began telling about the Space Shuttle firing lasers at Earth and showed a view of Earth, with Lake Tahoe in the upper right corner of the screen. If you put the two together, then you can see that the *Columbia* Space Shuttle is firing laser beams at Earth 'for environmental purposes,' precisely where the earthquakes are occurring. The President went to Camp David, then when the President returned (?), a plane crashed into the White House. Later he gave a speech in a room of the White House, then just after he left a fire broke out in the room. Rosh Hashanah is recently passed, and Yom Kippur is coming up. The President has ordered 8,300 Navy, 1,800 Marine and 4,000 Army personnel along with 15 or 20 warships to *[prepare to]* invade Haiti.\" Now, as I finish this article, as I am typing this the TV is telling that Carter and Colin Powell have arranged for the invasion of Haiti to be called off. The payload launched from Guyana was a relay mirror satellite for the weapon carried on *Columbia.* It was to be fired into earthquake lines in Southern California to trigger bombs that have been placed there, to set off earthquakes. The resulting destruction would allow the government to bring in FEMA and declare martial law. There are presently thousands of Russian troops across the border in Mexico and Baja California. The headline of the August 1994 *Criminal Politics* newsletter says, \"International Zionism Planning War in Mexico, 300 Tons of Soviet Hardware Landed in Veracruz.\" Recent articles in *SPOTLIGHT* newspaper and several other newspapers across the country, including the *San Francisco Chronicle,* have reported on thousands of Russian troops and military equipment presently seen inside the U.S. Clinton called two aircraft carriers into the Caribbean and called up the Reserves (usually, you call up the reserves when you are losing the battle!).

PART 14: THE REST OF THE STORY God did not say, \"Righteousness will make you free.\" He did not say, \"Obedience shall make you free.\" Obedience to a preacher, pope, pastor or guru WILL NOT DO IT. Neither will counting beads, ringing gongs, sitting cross-legged or chanting mantras. HE SAID THAT \"THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE.\" (John 8:32) We have lost a great deal of our freedoms, (and what is so appalling, most people are not even aware of it!) and are fast losing the rest. This must mean there is not much truth known and being taught! It is time we search for real truth! I have been asked for the rest of the story about what happened with the American Space Shuttle Program, so I will try to add more information as I have a chance. Now to continue the story. In my previous writing, I said that the \"End of the World\" was set for 3:00 PM E.D.T., Rosh Hashanah (Feast of Trumpets), Friday, September 17, 1982. At exactly 3:01 PM E.D.T. all of Russia would be in darkness. When the Indian Ocean Satellite signal would arrive confirming the American Phantom aircraft attack, it would be followed within a minute or so by the EMP episode described previously. This would signal all U.S. military forces to launch a full scale \"retaliatory\" nuclear attack against Russia. Obviously this did not happen, and I did not go into detail at the time about what really happened.

Obviously this did not happen, and I did not go into detail at the time about what really happened. A syndicated article published by *NEWSDAY* said that on June 10, 1982: \"President Reagan stunned allies at the NATO summit by telling them that as far as he is concerned the Soviet Union is at war with the United States, European officials said last week. The statement, which came as the President was summing up his views on the two-day meeting in Bonn, so surprised the other heads of state that they remained silent, and NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns immediately adjourned the session, according to these officials who were present at the summit a month ago.\" For several years prior the war had raged between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. There was just no public admission of the fact that the war was already under way between the superpowers. On July 13, *Pravda* published a speech by Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Ustinov which said that the U.S. was orchestrating a trade, credit and technological war against the Soviet Union. He also gave a blunt warning to Washington that a: \"...pre-emptive first-strike use of nuclear weapons could not insure an American victory.\" This indicated that Russia's new leaders knew about the Reagan Administration plan to launch nuclear war soon and they were prepared to defeat the Bolshevik-triggered American first strike if it was carried out. The Satanic Bolshevik-Zionist (Reagan/Begin) axis did not listen. They plunged right ahead with plans for all-out nuclear war. They had a 5-part plan. Part 1 was to stir up as much internal turmoil in Russia and her satellites as possible. This included sabotaging an Aeroflot jet which crashed in Moscow on July 6 (are any of you watching what is currently going on over there?) Part 2 called for conditioning the American people for war (anything like that going on now?). Part 3 of the plan involved the Space Shuttle Program. *Columbia STS-1* was launched April 12, 1981, on the 20th anniversary of the first orbital space flight of Russian Yuri Gagarin (and about two weeks after the \"attempted assassination\" of President Reagan). It was shot down by two Russian Cosmospheres. Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen were burned up when it crashed 85 miles south of Kazan in central Russia. A fake landing was staged at Edwards Air Force Base using the Shuttle *Enterprise* and actors. *Columbia STS-2* was launched November 12, 1981.

It supposedly carried Astronauts Joseph Engle and Richard Truly. In fact there were no human pilots aboard. It was shot down by Russian TU-144 jet airplanes using beam weapons, over the White Sea (near Finland on your map). *Columbia STS-3* was launched March 22, 1982. It was supposed to orbit a special new Spy Satellite. It was hardened against attack from Russia's space weapons and armed with a robot-controlled laser that could shoot back. In addition, the Shuttle itself was armed with lasers on this third try. It landed one day behind schedule on March 30, 1982 at White Sands. That is, something landed. Astronauts Lousma and Fullerton successfully deployed a new laser-armed spy satellite then abandoned ship and entered an escape capsule and returned to Earth splashdown in the Indian Ocean. From there they were flown to White Sands Missile Range, where they later faked another Shuttle landing. The \"End of the World\" was set for 3:00 PM E.D.T., Friday, Rosh Hashanah, Feast of Trumpets, September 17, 1982. However, what the Superspy Satellite found scared them into waiting, and the new launch date for Nuclear War One was eventually rescheduled for Feast of Trumpets, Thursday, September 20, 1990. This is where I left off in the previous article. *STS-4* was launched June 24, 1982, with Astronauts Thomas Mattingly and Henry Hartsfield (STS is Space Transportation System). Its purpose was to deploy a satellite that would be used to confirm the Phantom aircraft attack which was then the go-ahead for launching the nuclear missiles upon Russian targets. The Attack Confirmation Sensor was placed in geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean by an auxiliary rocket. It was a cryogenic satellite - that is, it was maintained at super-cold temperatures close to absolute zero. This cold state was intended to protect the satellite from detection by Russian space weapons which would be partially based on \"heat\" (infrared) sensors. For several years prior to 1982 the American scientific Intelligence analysts knew that the Russians had a new technology for target acquisition. The Russian technique was not radar, nor was it any other conventional means of detecting and tracking targets. The technique was deadly accurate, reliable, and, unlike radar, impossible to jam. Analysts were convinced they had figured out what the Russian technique was. They believed it was a Russian version of computer-enhanced infra-red detection. This was then developed in the U.S. and was called CEIR (see-er). Shortly after development, a CEIR-equipped American laser was used to shoot down a Russian Cosmosphere. All objects warmer than", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:93:028d2b31b33d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9793, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "not radar, nor was it any other conventional means of detecting and tracking targets.

Shortly after development, a CEIR-equipped American laser was used to shoot down a Russian Cosmosphere. All objects warmer than absolute zero emit infra-red radiation. The warmer the object is, the more infra-red for sensors to detect it. The only way to hide from CEIR is, therefore, to reduce the temperature as low as possible. That is why the Air Force Attack Confirmation Sensor was a cryogenic satellite. When our government tells us that the Shuttle payloads are carrying equipment to peer through clouds and electronic shields around planets and so on, don't you believe it. They are trying to develop a weapon they feel will give them the advantage when they launch all-out nuclear war, which they have tried to do several times. What do you think is really going on now with Korea, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq, etc.? Back to Shuttle mission #4. A liquid helium cooling system was originally used to keep the satellite only a few degrees above absolute zero, reducing infra-red emissions to nearly nothing. The cryogenic design of the Air Force satellite was what gave the Bolshevik war planners so much confidence that it would succeed. They were sure that the Russians would be unable to find it in time to destroy it before it was used in war. WRONG! The Pentagon Bolsheviks were wrong about the new Russian target-tracking technique. It was not an infra-red technique at all; instead, it was a revolutionary system which detects the atomic vibrations of matter. The Russians call it Psychoenergetic Range Finding, or PRF. The Russians regarded it as their master secret weapon. The longer it remained a mystery to the American Bolsheviks, the better it would be for Russia and so, when Space Shuttle #4 launched the Attack Confirmation Sensor in June, the Russians began the game playing. GAME PLAYING Instead of destroying the satellite right away, they allowed it to be orbited successfully. The Russians knew that the Attack Confirmation Satellite could do them no harm until war itself was about to begin, so they allowed it to stay there untouched for as long as possible. The result was exactly as expected: The long term survival of the Air Force Sensor convinced the Bolsheviks that they were right about Russia using CEIR. The Pentagon had walked right into a major intelligence blunder and the Russians were encouraging them to keep it up.

Throughout the summer Rockefeller cartel operatives within the CIA fed updates about the Pentagon war plan to the Russians. Those reports continued to say that the war timetable was remaining unchanged, targeted for mid-September, so the Russian Space Command let the Air Force Sensor alone for the interim time. Meanwhile, the Russians began preparing in a totally unsuspected way for the moment when they would destroy the satellite. Those preparations had to do with Russia's international telephone service. MEN IN OUR COUNTRY WERE PLANNING AN ALL-OUT FIRST-STRIKE HYDROGEN BOMB WAR WITH RUSSIA! Our government, friends. THEY HAD A BACKUP PLAN. If something happened to the Attack Confirmation Sensor, they could still tell whether or not the Phantom planes took out the Russian space bases, because the attack would shut down the Soviet telephone system! Or so they thought. In order to keep our Intelligence analysts from guessing what was afoot, the Russians resorted to a little disinformation in the right places. They created falsified leaks that there were unsettled conditions in the Kremlin, a power struggle (just like what is said to be going on over there right now). The Bolsheviks in the U.S., who are always struggling for power, swallowed the bait completely. First, in June of 1982 the Soviet Union drastically reduced the number of telephone links to the West. They also made clouded threats to reduce service still further at a later date. The next major step was to suddenly cut off all automatic dialing service to and from the West. The U.S. Bolsheviks were startled but still did not suspect what it really meant. They were too preoccupied with rumblings of trouble in China to worry for long about Russia's telephones. On April 21 the Rockefeller faction scored a major gain, while all eyes were on the Falklands crisis. The Bolshevik Admiral Bobby Inman was forced out as Deputy Director of the CIA and replaced by the Rockefeller man John McMahon. On June 24 the Shuttle was launched, and the next day a coup occurred when Rockefeller operative Alexander Haig was forced TO RESIGN and Bolshevik/Zionist (BZ) GEORGE SHULTZ took over as Secretary of State. The World War III (Nuclear War I) date was set for September 17 (Feast of Trumpets), but on September 1 Communist Party Chairman Hu Yaobang dropped a bombshell at the Party Congress in Peking.

He declared that China should no longer ally itself with the U.S. against Russia; instead Hu said China should regard both superpowers as equal threats but at the same time he included some conciliatory language toward Russia and said high Russian officials would come to China to begin talks around mid-month at China's invitation! By disowning the Sino-American alliance, Hu Yaobang made it clear that the secret American Stealth attack-base IN CHINA WAS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY. That base, located in Red China's western Sinkiang Province, was essential for the intended attack on Russia's two Cosmosphere bases in Siberia. That war base was the reason for the joint communique of August 17 by the U.S. and Red China concerning Taiwan. The communique committed the U.S. to discontinue arms delivery to Taiwan at some future date in violation of Reagan's past pledges. The communique was agreed to in order to head off a threatened shutdown of the Stealth base by the Chinese, but it was not enough to satisfy the Chinese. On September 6 former President Richard Nixon arrived in Peking, adding further to the troubles of the Pentagon war-planners (think about what has happened recently with Clinton-Carter, Korea-Haiti and such. THINK!) Nixon had long been cooperating with the Rockefeller cartel. Nixon went to Peking as a Rockefeller envoy and one with far more credibility for the Chinese than anyone the Bolsheviks had. Nixon shocked the Chinese by confirming what Russian sources had already told them - that the Stealth base was about to be used in war. Nixon then counseled them not to shut down the base outright at that time for fear of undesirable reactions by the trigger-happy Pentagon Bolsheviks. Instead, he urged the Chinese to start interfering with operations of the Stealth base by bureaucratic devices. That is one thing the Chinese are very, very good at, and they accepted Nixon's advice. By September 9 the American Stealth base in Sinkiang Province was effectively put out of action. Critical base personnel were tangled up in Chinese \"red\" tape, preventing them from reporting for duty. The Chinese were giving hints to Washington that all this was due to continued dissatisfaction over Taiwan but the real reason was that they wanted no part of a nuclear war with Russia and Russia would have taken that base right off the map. The Kremlin received word through Rockefeller channels on September 9 that the Sinkiang Province Stealth base had been effectively neutralized. At that point the Russians could rest assured that even if the Pentagon went through with its nuclear attack plan, Russia's Cosmospheres", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:96:a392a6461f6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9796, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 97, "text": "Washington that all this was due to continued dissatisfaction over Taiwan but the real reason was that they wanted no part of a nuclear war with Russia and Russia would have taken that base right off the map. The Kremlin received word through Rockefeller channels on September 9 that the Sinkiang Province Stealth base had been effectively neutralized. At that point the Russians could rest assured that even if the Pentagon went through with its nuclear attack plan, Russia's Cosmospheres would survive quite nicely. Russia's critical space triad of strategic weapons COULD NOT BE DESTROYED. The next Friday, September 10, there was a sudden total shutdown of most International Telephone service to and from Russia but, in order to send a message to America's Bolshevik war planners, a few selected circuits were kept open. Those included Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and Tallinn. Their significance lay in the fact that none were targets planned for the initial Stealth attack. The phone lines were cut off at 7:10 AM E.D.T., or 2:10 PM Moscow time. Moments later the Russian Space Command went to work. A Russian Jumbo Cosmosphere was parked in a pseudo-orbit about two miles above the Air Force Attack Confirmation satellite. It had been there for well over two months - from the moment the satellite was launched into orbit from Space Shuttle #4. By using its electromagnetic propulsion system at low power the Cosmosphere had remained on station instead of slowly drifting away as a normal satellite would and, parked as it was above the downward looking Air Force satellite, the presence of the Cosmosphere was never detected. The time had come! The Cosmosphere aimed its beam weapon and fired. Shortly after 7:10 AM E.D.T. on Friday, September 10, there was very bad news for the Bolsheviks. At the newly operational Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs (which used Control Data Corporation computers) there was a sudden loss of signal from their Indian Ocean satellite. At first they could not believe that their critical Attack Confirmation Satellite had been attacked. All sorts of things were tried in an effort to reestablish contact with the satellite - all to no avail. The satellite no longer existed! However, their attitude was, it really didn't matter. America was going to be sucked into a totally annihilating war at any rate. We are speaking about reactions and actions regarding the planned war - not what was or was not actually possible. As that Friday morning of September 10 wore on, the \"Project Z\" war planners were convened in crisis conference. The question was: What do we do now? Someone suggested falling back to the back-up plan based on the telephones. \"We can still go with the back-up plan - every target in Russia that is attacked by our birds will be obliterated.

If international telephone service to Russian target areas is suddenly cut off at zero hour, we can assume that our birds made it.\" There is always someone who didn't get the word. Nearly everyone yelled at him, \"The Russian phones are already shut down!!\" For a while there was an atmosphere of near panic. Some were sure that a first strike by Russia was sure to follow and that the Pentagon should push the Nuclear Button without delay. Others argues that if that were the Kremlin's intention, it was already too late - Russia's missiles would be on the way already. Someone suggested that the whole Project Z war plan be aborted and rescheduled for later on. Everyone agreed on one thing: without the Attack Confirmation Sensor, any attack on Russia had become far more risky. After launching the Stealth planes from Norway and Turkey, it would just have to be assumed that they had destroyed their targets. But, you see, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE! With the Attack Confirmation Satellite gone there would be no way to confirm that, so the all-out follow-up attack by America's nuclear forces might run into a lot more than just the trouble which might have been expected. Not much has changed, friends, we are still ruled by snakes! The Russians kept the International phone lines shut down for seven hours that day. They wanted to make sure that if the Pentagon Bolsheviks pushed the Panic Button, they would obtain absolutely no intelligence at all by monitoring telephone circuits. After the first two hours of the morning blackout, Secretary of State George Shultz was asked by reporters about it. Shultz told them, \"It is very significant,\" but would say no more. The idiots still planned to go through with it, and the go-ahead was set for Rosh Hashanah. Project Z would continue on schedule. Meanwhile, every effort would be made to cut through the Chinese red tape that was restricting use of the critical base in Sinkiang Province. At the same time, it was decided to set other plans in motion, too, just in case Project Z should finally fall through. The countdown continued until Z-Day, Friday morning on September 17. At about 8:30 AM in Washington, a well-known national newspaper reporter was interviewed on the Washington NBC radio station, WRC.

The countdown was called off with less than five hours to go. It has been rescheduled and aborted at least four times since then, including, as well as I can figure it out, the last time was Rosh Hashanah (Feast of Trumpets) this past month (September 1994). When ancient Israel was warned about Nebuchadnezzar, they said, \"We are God's people, God will protect us.\" The survivors were marched naked into captivity in Babylon. In 70 AD the Jews in Jerusalem said, \"We are God's people, God will save us.\" They all died. I continually hear good people today saying, \"I can not do anything about it; I leave it up to God; it is HIS will.\" BUT GOD SAYS, I GIVE YOU FREE WILL, NOT PROPHECIES. PROPHECIES SHALL FAIL, UNLESS YOU CHOOSE THEM (I Cor. 13:8). If you sit and do nothing, while your enemy works to destroy you, then you will be destroyed. Free Will is God's Will. So be it. Have a nice day. END OF PART 14. PART 15: FORWARD by the Author Many who read \"Fire >From The Sky\" (Parts 1-14) were shocked at the story. Some have said \"I don't believe it\" or \"It can't be!\" It is true, whether you believe it or not. For those of you who want to better understand, I will try to share with you some of the things I have learned. I will reveal here some more things that \"our\" government wants to keep TOP SECRET. The *FIRE FROM THE SKY* material told of anti-gravity Cosmospheres, invisible ships, and other \"far out\" stuff such as \"Psychoenergetic Range Finding.\" \"Psycho\" is right, you may think. Before you make judgments about something about which you know nothing, why not try to learn more about it? This material is for those of you who wish to research and learn more about the subject.

THE MARVEL OF EMPTY SPACE Many top scientists are recently talking about \"Universes\" coming into existence out of \"nothing\" and such. How can this be, isn't this thinking a form of insanity? Those of you who completed your brainwashing classes (I believe you called them college and university courses) a few years ago, may not be aware that the top scientists are now discussing about things coming into existence out of nothing, etc. *Science News,* Feb. 18, 1995, in an article called \"Making universes, constants out of nothing\" (p. 102) says, \"Quantum cosmology posits that incredibly tiny universes spontaneously nucleat out of nothing.\" Weren't we taught that \"spontaneous generation\" is along the line of \"old-wives' tales?\" If you stop and think, you will realize that the material universe had to come into existence out of \"nothing,\" or else it had to have existed forever with no beginning. If you check current literature, you will find much discussion among top physicists, mathematicians, etc., about these questions. For an example, read \"Nothing's plenty: The vacuum in modern quantum field theory\" by I.J.R. Aitchison, *Contemporary Physics,* 26(4), 1985, pp. 887-894. Or see Yu. G. Itnat'ev, \"Relativistic kinetics of an anisotropic plasmalike medium with damping in the field of gravitational radiation,\" *Soviet Physics Journal,* 27(12), Dec. 1984, (English translation: Plenum, June 1985), pp. 1066-1069. The article is about producing energy from a vacuum. Michio Kaku, author of *Hyperspace, A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension,* speaks of empty space \"bubbling\" and the universe coming into existence from these \"bubbles.\" Fritjof Capra, in *The Tao of Physics,* (Bantam Paperbacks, p. 208), says: The distinction between matter and empty space finally had to be abandoned when it became evident that virtual particles can come into being spontaneously out of the void, and vanish again into the void, without any nucleon or other strongly interacting particle being present... the vacuum is far from empty. On the contrary, it contains an unlimited number of particles which come into being and vanish without end. Here, then, is the closest parallel to the Void of Eastern mysticism in modern physics. Like the Eastern Void, the \"physical vacuum\" - as it is called in field theory - is not a state of mere nothingness, but contains the potentiality for all forms of the particle world. These forms, in turn, are not independent physical entities, but merely transient manifestations of the underlying Void. As the *sutra* says, \"Form is emptiness, and emptiness is indeed form.\" The relation between the virtual particles and the vacuum is an essentially dynamic relation; the vacuum is truly a \"living Void,\" pulsating in endless rhythms of creation and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:100:9122c202df1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9800, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "called in field theory - is not a state of mere nothingness, but contains the potentiality for all forms of the particle world.

As the *sutra* says, \"Form is emptiness, and emptiness is indeed form.\" The relation between the virtual particles and the vacuum is an essentially dynamic relation; the vacuum is truly a \"living Void,\" pulsating in endless rhythms of creation and destruction. The discovery of the dynamic quality of the vacuum is seen by many physicists as one of the most important findings of modern physics. From the role as an empty container of the physical phenomena, the void has emerged as a dynamic quantity of utmost importance. The results of modern physics thus seem to confirm the words of the Chinese sage Chang Tsai: \"When one knows that the Great Void is full of *Ch'i,* one realizes that there is no such thing as nothingness.\" This science of applying the physics of creating \"something\" out of \"nothing\" is variously called \"energetics,\" \"Psychoenergetics,\" \"scalar electromagnetics,\" \"orgone energy,\" \"radionics,\" etc. *Air & Space* magazine, June/July 1995, in the article by Frank Kuznik (p. 70) about making a vacuum, starts: Can something ever come of nothing? Alex Ignatiev fervently hopes so. Ignatiev, a University of Houston physics and chemistry professor, is scribbling equations for that very process on a board in his cluttered campus office. *Fer-De-Lance,* by Col. T.E. Bearden, p. 106, #60, says: Interactions which occurred between Krushchev and renowned physicist and Nobelian P. Kapitsa are of interest. Krushchev desired absolute defense of the Soviet Union so that the Soviets might be able to launch any action desired without risk of serious concern. Kapitsa informed the Soviet leader that, if a means of total neutralization of foreign missiles was to be found, it could only come from a group of new principles in physics which was called \"Energetics.\" The term \"energetics,\" of course, was contracted from \"psychoenergetics,\" and is essentially the expanded physics/electromagnetics that this author (Bearden) has dubbed, *scalar electromagnetics.* Now you know what \"psychoenergetics\" in the *Fire From The Sky* document is the same as what T.E. Bearden calls \"scalar electromagnetics\" and the Russians call \"energetics.\" (The Russian rocket that supplies their Mir [Russian for \"World\"] Space Station is called \"Energia.\") Bearden has had a considerable amount of writings published on the subject. For a list of his books, contact the Tesla Book Company, P.O. Box 121873, Chula Vista, CA 91912. To further track this information, take note of the following: So about 1950 or so, the Soviet Union would have started phenomenology experimentation in earnest, with phase conjugate radar mirrors and phase conjugate radars. This is what was referred to as *energetics.* The Soviets began a massive program in energetics about the time of the beginning of the Korean", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:101:4345bd1e4148", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9801, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "on the subject.

This is what was referred to as *energetics.* The Soviets began a massive program in energetics about the time of the beginning of the Korean War (p. 86, *Aids, Biological Warfare* by T.E. Bearden). Building upon Whittaker's important work, I formulated a conceptual revision to electromagnetics, which I dubbed *scalar electromagnetics* to accent that the observable EM vector force fields did not exist as such in a vacuum, but dynamic scalar fields did [\"vacuum\" is not empty]. I also wished to call strong attention to the fact that observable force does not exist until an observable particle of mass is coupled to the interference of the two scalar fields (much like in the Aharonov-Bohm effect). The Soviets, of course, call this area *energetics.* Energetics technology has been used in gigantic weapons programs of the Soviet Union for decades, and it appears to be developed under the most highly classified program that the Soviets possess. All development and deployment of energetics weapons is under the KGB and controlled directly by that organization, not by the Soviet Armed Forces (p. 88, *Aids, Biological Warfare).* P. 89 says scalar electromagnetics \"allowed the direct engineering of the unified field theory, including structuring the vacuum, curving local spacetime, and producing effects at a distance [like shooting down aircraft] and in higher dimensions.\" Please take special note of the above key identification terms \"phase conjugate mirrors,\" as this helps us to identify this subject in other literature! At this point you do not need to understand what it is talking about, just remember the term. ZERO IS NOT NOTHING We think of vacuum as zero, nothing, empty, nada, nichts, zilch. If we have 7 rocks and we take away 7 rocks, then we have no rocks, zero rocks. Later we learn that this is not always so. If we have 7 pieces of matter and 7 pieces of anti-matter, when combined we have zero, although we actually have 14 pieces. You may say that they canceled out each other and you now have nothing. Think of what you are saying. Are you saying that 14 things can be combined and cease to exist and become nothing? Then isn't it conversely possible that \"nothing\" can yield or be divided into 14 \"real\" \"things.\" In algebra we add seven plus-ones to seven minus-ones and get a sum total of zero, again in spite of the fact that there are actually 14 numbers. Bearden states it as: \"Although zero is the absence of just a *single* thing, it can be the presence of *multiple*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:102:b3c931c19b80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9802, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "you saying that 14 things can be combined and cease to exist and become nothing?

Bearden states it as: \"Although zero is the absence of just a *single* thing, it can be the presence of *multiple* things\" (p. 98, *AIDS*). You already know that \"empty space\" is not too empty - it contains radio waves, radar waves, gravity, cosmic rays, etc. Even when these are removed, Bearden and others point out that what we think of as \"empty space\" actually consists of an incredible amount of positive and negative forces that cancel each other out and sum to zero, thus appearing to be \"not there.\" By \"curving space\" and such, some forces become \"out of balance\" and the result is light, or gravity, etc. Normally this is expressed as positive gravity, but under the right conditions, the gravitation force is reversed. This is called anti-gravity. And, yes, my friends, the Russians (and now others) have anti-gravity. Note: For those readers who might already understand Bearden, I am aware that he says that force does not exist in a vacuum. (\"But if force CONSISTS OF mass welded to acceleration, it cannot exist in the absence of mass. Hence force does not exist in vacuum... Therefore neither magnetic field nor gravitational field exist in vacuum. The greatest error in physics has been the assignment of a force as a cause, and thus assigning it to the vacuum. The force is an *EFFECT,* and it never exists in a vacuum, a priori.\" (Toward A New Electromagnetics Part 4: Vectors And Mechanisms Clarified, slide 14.) The problem is physics and electronics as taught in universities are WRONG and there are problems with definitions, so in this brief introduction, I will say things in a simplified way that may not be correct in a higher understanding, but are necessary steps in beginning to understand. My purpose is not to explain the mechanics of exactly \"how it works,\" I am not qualified to do that. My purpose is to encourage you to break through your brainwashing and WAKE UP to reality and see who is your REAL ENEMY. A *knowledge* of these things *IS* a MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. END OF PART 15.

The last thing in the world they want is for us to have free energy, which is what results from understanding psychoenergetics (scalar electromagnetics, energetics, etc.). What does all this mean to you? Let's look at one example. There is a major government project being built in Alaska called the \"HAARP\" Program. \"High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.\" One of the patents for this project claims that it can \"cause... total disruption of communications over a very large portion of the Earth... disrupting not only land-based communications, but also airborne communications and sea communications (both surface and subsurface)... missile or aircraft destruction, deflection, or confusion... weather modification... by altering solar absorption... ozone, nitrogen, etc., concentrations could be artificially increased...\" I have a friend who returned from Canada recently. He was in contact with Nick Begich, Jr., who is monitoring the HAARP project (contact Nick at P.O. Box 201393, Anchorage, AK 99520). The friend was told that the government did a full wattage power-up test of HAARP on December 14, 1994. This date is rather interesting when you match it with the following article which appeared in the *Austin American-Statesman* newspaper on the next day, December 15, 1994. Western cities in the dark after 8-state mystery blackout. *Power surge might have triggered outages for up to 2 million people, by Richard Cole, AP. SAN FRANCISCO - An unexplained power surge in the West Coast's main electrical transmission line caused blackouts and other power power disruptions across eight Western states early Wednesday, shutting down a nuclear plant and forcing doctors to operate by flashlight. As many as two million customers from Arizona to Washington went without power for periods ranging from a few seconds to several hours when a stretch of the giant 500-kilovolt Pacific power grid went dead just after midnight. The blackout darkened the homes of 1 million California customers and interrupted power to patches of Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana. An initial inspection showed no breaks in the section where the trouble began, a 60-mile line between Tracy and Fresno in California's Central Valley. \"We believe it was a power surge from outside our service area, and a substation tripped to prevent an overloading of our system, just as a circuit breaker would do in your house,\" said Bill Sessa, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokesman.

Issing LEGAL-REP: Foley & Lardner ABSTRACT: This invention relates to generation of an Artificial Ionospheric Mirror (AIM), or a plasma layer in the atmosphere. The AIM is used like the ionosphere to reflect RF energy over great distances. A tiltable AIM is created by a heater antenna controlled in phase and frequency. The heater antenna phase shift scans a beam to paint a plasma layer. Frequency is changed to refocus at continually higher altitudes to tilt the plasma layer.

Eastlund's Aug. 13, 1991 patent (No. 5,038,664) describes the system now being implemented in the U.S. HAARP transmitter: If the particles which form the plasma along the Earth's field lines continued to move with a constant pitch angle, often designated \"alpha,\" they would soon impact on the Earth's surface. However, in converging force field, the pitch angle does change in such a way as to allow the particle to turn around and avoid impact. The point at which the particle turns around is called the mirror point. This process is repeated at the other end of the field line. The particle again turns around and this is called the \"conjugate point\" of the original mirror point. The particle is therefore trapped and bounces between the two magnetic mirrors. The particle can continue oscillating in space in this manner for long periods of time. (Letter with July 1994 copy of *Youth Action News,* P.O. Box 312, Alexandria, VA 22313.) I think it is obvious that the HAARP project is the same as the scalar electromagnetics phase conjugate mirrors that Bearden describes in articles he has written detailing Russian weather warfare against the United States and the shoot-down of the *Challenger* Space Shuttle, the destruction of numerous rockets and missiles, and relative to the ongoing (including recent) shoot-downs of many aircraft (such as the USAIR crash near Pittsburgh).

And now, it was revealed soon after the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, that there were two bomb blasts, the second of which came from overhead pulse beam blasts. (*CONTACT: The Phoenix Project* newspaper, April 25, 1995, p. 31. For subscriptions, call 1-800-800-5565.) CONFUSION One of the results that scalar electromagnetics can produce, as listed above, is \"confusion.\" We hear of controllers becoming \"confused\" in Iraq and shooting down our own helicopters. We hear of a pilot trying to land on a carrier and becoming \"confused\" and crashing. Recently in the news we hear of a helicopter pilot in Korea who got \"confused\" and strayed across the border and was shot down. In today's newspapers, as I write these notes, is an article which states: \"Human error alone was to blame for a U.S. Army helicopter straying into North Korea and getting shot down last winter, but no one involved should be punished, the Army said in a report Thursday. It said Hilemon and Hall had become disoriented in unfamiliar terrain.\" (*Austin American Statesman,* \"Army blames none for North Korea shootdown,\" p. A3, June 23, 1995.) This sounds reasonable enough until you stop and think. It is almost impossible for today's highly sophisticated military vehicles to become \"lost,\" unless something pretty major happens, because of geo-positioning satellites and such. Any fisherman can buy a little hand-held device that will tell him where he is. How can pilots flying one of the world's most dangerous borders just \"stray\" across? Do you remember the infamous raid into Iran to rescue the hostages during President Carter's administration, April 24-26, 1980? If you recall, the raid failed, because the helicopters got lost and had their equipment fouled because of sandstorms and the pilots got \"confused\" and crashed into each other. It was a very embarrassing incident for the United States. These were the most highly-trained people in the world (U.S. Army Special Forces Delta Teams) flying the best equipment in the world, and they got defeated by \"dust storms?\" Did it never occur to any of the pilots to simply fly above the dust storms? Doesn't that suggest there must be more to the story? Let's examine this event more closely. Col. Charlie Beckwith was the officer in charge of the Delta Teams and writes of the event in his book *Delta Force.* (Harcourt Brace Janovich, with Donald Knox, copyright 1983.)

Charlie Beckwith was the officer in charge of the Delta Teams and writes of the event in his book *Delta Force.* (Harcourt Brace Janovich, with Donald Knox, copyright 1983.) Three troop-carrying MC-130s and three fuel-bearing EC-130s left from Masirah Island off the coast of Oman and flew to a desert spot in Iran. There they were to wait 30 minutes for eight helicopters to arrive. Then the 118 man assault force would load on to the RH-53D helicopters and continue the raid. For some reason, the helicopters were up to an hour and a half late. When the helicopters started arriving, Beckwith quoted them as saying, \"Its been a hell of a trip,\" and \"words to the effect that if we had any sense we would move the helios out into the desert and load everyone on C-130s and go home.\" Strange words for the most highly-motivated, gung-ho soldiers in the military, don't you think? \"I didn't understand how tough a time he'd really had; and he didn't elaborate on his statement.\" Two helicopters never arrived at all, and the six that did eventually arrive came from scattered in all directions. One pilot said, \"I don't know who's really running things at my level, but I'll tell you this much, that some very careful consideration ought to be given to calling off this operation. You have no idea what I've been through. The damndest sandstorm I've ever seen hit us. It was tough! I gotta tell you, I'm not sure we're going to make it. I'm really not sure we can make it.\" \"Here were two very strong officers whom we'd observed and knew, who now were pretty well shattered. \"Things were so confused that the mission was called off. They began to load back onto the C-130s to leave. I turned around and began to walk quietly toward the head of the line. It was nearly 2:40 A.M. Some of the C-130 pilots had started to gun their engines. Dust was blowing all around. Between wind gusts, I saw one of the choppers lift off and bank to the left. It slid slightly backward. Then, BALLLOOEE! It wasn't a bomb, not a CRACK! It was a THUMP!\" Next a \"gasoline\" explosion. A blue fireball ballooned into the night. Obviously, the chopper I'd just seen lift off - it had been Major Schaefer's - had struck the northernmost EC-130, the one on which Blue Element had just boarded\" (pp. 244-248).

Another helicopter (Number Eight) landed with it. When it was determined that Number Six could not proceed farther, its crew climbed aboard the other chopper, which then proceeded to Desert One. Helicopter Number Five, the one in which Colonel Pittman was flying, turned back to the carrier four-fifths of the way to Desert One, when after flying through several cyclonic sandstorms, it began experiencing instrument problems.\" Dr. Peter Beter recorded the following comments on this incident a month later on June 28, 1980, which were published in *Wisconsin Report* newspaper on July 31, 1980. (Dr. Beter was an attorney practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court, appointed to U.S. Export-Import Bank by President Kennedy, was involved in intelligence activities, originator of the term \"stagflation\", responsible for revealing that there is no gold in Fort Knox, and had many intelligence contacts. He had access to very high-level sources of information.) [Quoting:] The American Commandoes who were sent into Iran tried their best to follow orders and do their duty; but unknown to them, those who had planned the raid did not intend for it to succeed. They were supposed to reach Teheran but discovered too late that they were too small a force to do the job. As soon as the Commandoes ran into big trouble, that was to be used as an excuse for American navy jets to strafe Teheran; and with American passion stirred up, the Iran crisis was to escalate with additional military moves. But for more than a year now, Russian Intelligence has been informed about even the most secret plans in Washington; and so the Russians were ready. They unraveled the latest Bolshevik war plan in two ways. First the huge armada of cosmospheres were floating overhead on April 25 as the American helicopter force entered Iran. Using their weather modification capabilities, the Cosmospheres intensified dust storms in the area. They also utilized microwave brain-scrambling radiation to cause nausea, disorientation, and fatigue among the helicopter crews. The Russian brain-scrambler is the same technology which I first revealed in Audio Letter No. 20. The Russians were hoping to cause the mission to be given up as hopeless without casualties, but the American Commando force reached its first check point, regrouped and prepared to continue. So the Cosmospheres turned up their brain-scrambling transmitters to full power. One helicopter took off but veered off crazily, and sliced into a C-130 Troop Transport airplane. Two others prepared to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:108:4021ce360a74", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9808, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "helicopter crews.

Two others prepared to take off. The Cosmospheres overhead fired low-power bursts from their Particle Beams, rotor blades flew off, and the helicopters went nowhere. At that point it was obvious that it was all over. The raid was aborted, and all energy shifted to efforts to explain away the disaster to the public. Soon the charred bodies of slain Commandoes were flown home to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. It was the second time in less than two years for Dover to receive bodies from a secret Commando raid by the United States! The first time they had paid the price for a successful operation was in Guyana [Jonestown]. On April 28... Cyrus Vance resigned as Secretary of State in protest. In the next paragraph, Beter continues by telling of Russian pulse beams triggering the eruption of Mt. St. Helens on May 18, but that is another story.

PART 17: THE JONESTOWN MASSACRE HOAX In studying what the truth is behind many of the events in recent history, you will find some amazing interconnections. Once you realize that the same \"elite\" groups of conspirators are behind many of our problems, it should not be surprising that there are connections because it is the same people involved. A better known example that could be given of this is E. Howard Hunt. Most researchers know that Hunt was involved in such seemingly unrelated events as the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Kennedy assassination and Watergate.

Most researchers know that Hunt was involved in such seemingly unrelated events as the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Kennedy assassination and Watergate. If you \"do your homework,\" you will find connections between the Jonestown massacre, the Waco massacre, and the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. To understand the Jim Jones Jonestown tragedy, you need to understand some of the background. In 1976-79, I worked in the classified section of Control Data Corporation. Control Data had the world's most powerful computers at that time, and they were used by the U.S. in its most secret and most important projects. I was also coordinator for the Mensa Special Interest Group called the \"Doomsday Club.\" I wrote a newsletter called the *Doomsday Club News and Intelligence Report.* I learned some things that concerned me about what Russia was doing and quoted an article from the Oct. 2, 1978, *Aviation Week and Space Technology* magazine in my October newsletter. I learned, for instance, that Russia had been shooting down our spy satellites. What I did not know at the time was that Dr. Peter David Beter was also concerned because he was getting information superior to some of our intelligence services about what was really going on. For example, in June 1976, Dr. Beter received information that Russia had planted a nuclear bomb on Mt. Desert Island, Maine, near the Seal Harbor home of Nelson Rockefeller. He reported the information to General George S. Brown, Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, who had the information checked AND FOUND THE BOMB. Nelson Rockefeller immediately put his home up for sale, although it had been in the Rockefeller for two generations. Dr. Beter said, \"But my report of June 1976 about the Seal Harbor bomb led to far more than the present unsettled real estate conditions there. It proved to high intelligence that the Dr. Beter Audio Letter could be trusted to tell the truth; and from that point onward, I began receiving large amounts of intelligence information that is not entrusted to any other public information channel.\" (Dr. Beter Audio Tape #39 recorded 10/29/78.) Dr. Beter continued to give Gen. Brown such information as the precise location of Russia's secret missile and bomb emplacement, including some that had been planted on American soil and in U.S. rivers, near dams, etc. Russia would plant them, Dr. Beter would tell Brown, and Brown would have them removed. The Bolsheviks in our government who were working with Russia arranged to have Brown replaced, and the bombs were no longer removed. On October 1, 1976, President Gerald Ford (a secret Communist and member of the Michigan Mafia) signed what has been called the treasonous Red Friday Agreement and the Russians were allowed to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:110:996b283b6abb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9810, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 111, "text": "planted on American soil and in U.S. rivers, near dams, etc. Russia would plant them, Dr. Beter would tell Brown, and Brown would have them removed.

On October 1, 1976, President Gerald Ford (a secret Communist and member of the Michigan Mafia) signed what has been called the treasonous Red Friday Agreement and the Russians were allowed to continue without interference. In Beter's Audio Letter #39, recorded 10/29/78, and printed in *Wisconsin Report* of November 16, 1978, he quoted the same October 2nd article from *Aviation Week* that I quoted in *my* October 1978 newsletter, about Russia attaining Particle Beam weapons technology. In his letter he said, \"Last September 1977 I reported Russia's first operational use of Particle Beam weapons in space. On September 20, 1977, the Russians blasted an American Spy Satellite into a huge fireball in space as it passed over the Petrozvodsk Observatory in northern Russia. And barely a week later, on September 27, 2977, the secret American Moon Base in Copernicus Crater was silenced by Russia's neutron-beam attack from Earth orbit. America had just lost the Battle of the Harvest Moon. Immediately America was forced to stop short in her secret Beam-weapons race with Russia, for suddenly our Unseen Rulers were teetering on the edge of war itself - and Russia suddenly was calling the shots.\" And now, friends, you know what the Apollo Moon Landing (hoax) was about - it was a cover for the real above-top-secret military missions. Although top secret, hints of the base have appeared here and there. The December 1993/January 1994 issue of *Air & Space* magazine, in the article \"Securing the High Ground,\" said: \"Details of the moon base, which were contained in a thick secret report called 'Military Lunar Base Program or S.R. 183 Lunar Observatory Study,' were revealed by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division's Directorate of Space Planning and Analysis *in April 1960.* The heart of S.R. (Study Requirement) 183 was an underground lunar-Based Earth-Bombardment System that would insure 'positive retaliation' in the event of a Soviet attack against the United States. Although the report said that construction of the missile complex could be postponed for three or four years, it called for active planning for the base to begin '*immediately* if maximum military advantage is to be derived from a lunar program.\" The broad outlines of the moonbase plan had been published in the April and September 1959 issues of *Aviation Week.* Richard Hoagland, R. Ren_, Bill Kaysing, and others have determined that the NASA moon landings as presented were hoaxed and they discuss what might really have happened.

Hoagland has found evidence of the remains of highly advanced structures on the Moon AND Mars. What Hoagland does not know is that *some* of those structures could be American built. This is a story that remains to be told. You will wonder where Beter got his information, including information that not even our highest intelligence services knew. Most of you are not ready for the answer to THAT QUESTION, but for those of you who are ready, I will tell you that the answer is revealed on page 204 of *Missing the Lifeboat?* Phoenix Journal #86 and page 29 of *Ascension or Never-Never Land?* Phoenix Journal #98. [Call 1-800-800-5565 to order.] On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy (in his state of the union address, not the inaugural address as sometimes reported) made the famous speech in which he said: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.\" Apparently he did not know at the time, although he soon began to learn, that at the time he made that statement, there was a base already on the Moon. A year later, on May 22, 1962, a space probe landed on Mars and confirmed the existence of an environment which could support life. Not long afterward the construction of a colony on the planet Mars was begun in real earnest. If you want to learn more, I suggest you research the subject known among the UFO crowd as \"Alternative 3\" (the book by that name is about 75% true and 25% disinformation). \"Bob Grodin\" was a pseudonym for an astronaut who saw the real base. The moonbase was set up by our *actual* rulers, known as Bilderbergers (this project was headed by the particular group known as the Jason Society), with headquarters in Switzerland. They have meetings to make their plans and *Spotlight* newspaper likes to brag that it is able to penetrate the meetings. What *Spotlight* doesn't know is the main meetings were conducted on a nuclear submarine under the Polar ice cap. There are fewer party crashers there. For proof that NASA has lied to you, contact Richard Hoagland of the Mars Mission. While you are at it, ask him about Dan Quayle. *(The Mars Mission,* 122 Dodd St. Weehawken, NJ 07087).

People who worked on the Apollo programs and in NASA will say that I do not know what I am talking about, after all, they were \"there,\" they \"know.\" For serious open-minded researcher, those who realize that something is fishy with NASA and want to know the real truth, I will tell you that the *REAL* Moon vehicles operate out of S-4 in Nevada (and sometimes Area 51), not to mention the Russian bases. CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS In 1962, it was learned that Russia was deploying nuclear missiles in Cuba. The information was obtained from photos taken by a U2 aircraft piloted by Roger Chaffee. President John F. Kennedy, thanks to information provided to him by the Russian defector Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, knew Russia's military weaknesses and warned Khruschev to pull the missiles out. Khruschev was in no position to stand up to Kennedy, so he removed the missiles. The story has been written many times in books and articles. The U2 pilot Roger Chaffee later was chosen as an astronaut on Apollo 1, commanded by veteran astronaut Gus Grissom (Mercury and Gemini flights). The evidence indicates Chaffee, Grissom and White were murdered, perhaps because Grissom did not like to cooperate in the hoax. Grissom told his wife, \"If there ever is a serious accident in the Space Program, it's likely to be me.\" Grissom tried to get NASA chief administrator Joe Shea to go through the Apollo test with him. Chaffee had never been in space, but was a veteran of secret intelligence missions such as the U2 flights. NASA had 7 oxygen fire accidents before Grissom, Chaffee, and White were \"accidently\" burned up in Apollo I in January, 1967. General Phillips, Frank Borman's superior, did an investigation which was withheld from the public as \"classified.\" Why classified? What were they hiding? Eight astronauts died of \"accidents\" in 1967. Is it any wonder that the other astronauts \"got with the program?\" For more details see *NASA Mooned America!* by R. Ren_. (R.

Ren_, 31 Burgess Place, Passaic, NJ 07055.) What Kennedy did *not* know when the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred was that Russia was very close to deploying a totally new weapons system. Khruschev lost much face with his countrymen, temporarily. To regain face with his leaders, on April 10, 1963, he tested his new weapons system by destroying the *U.S.S. Thresher* nuclear submarine. That is another story for another time. What all the many books about the Cuban Missile Crisis did not tell you, however, was where Khruschev moved those missiles. At that time the secret Rockefeller/Soviet alliance was in full swing, and the long range joint plans for a controlled Nuclear War were moving right along. Both sides were looking ahead toward an eventual double-cross, but that still lay far in the future at that time. The deliberate strengthening of Russia at America's expense was part of their joint plan for World Government and conquest. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 threw a temporary monkey wrench into the program when President Kennedy intervened personally and stopped the nuclear arming of Cuba; and for doing that, and other humane \"indiscretions,\" he lost his life in Dallas barely a year later. For additional information on Kennedy's secret plans, read *Final Judgment* by Michael Collins Piper, available from *Spotlight* newspaper, 300 Independence Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003. PART 18: GUYANA Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, made sure that *he* followed the script more carefully. In the wake of the Cuban crisis, the Russians needed a new forward base in the Caribbean area for strategic purposes until the heat was off in Cuba. To accommodate Russia, Guyana was selected for this purpose, and David Rockefeller saw to it that a Marxist named Forbes Burnham became Prime Minister. In return, the Chase Manhattan Bank became fiscal agent for Guyana, giving Rockefeller access to the gold produced in Guyana; and as a key factor in all this, then-President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 turned over the American Air Base, Atkinson Field, to Guyana. America's right to retain control over the base for several more decades was simply thrown away without any excuses offered. Atkinson Field, which was then renamed Temehri Airfield, is south of Georgetown, the capital city. This is the airfield to which American helicopters carried bodies to be airlifted to America after the Jonestown disaster. When Johnson gave the Temehri Airfield to Marxist Guyana, he handed Russia a very large plum indeed. The Temehri Airfield is the largest in all of Latin America, larger even than New York's largest airport, the John F. Kennedy Airport; and its location makes it ideal for ferrying Cuban", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:114:6131b56c2953", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9814, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "was then renamed Temehri Airfield, is south of Georgetown, the capital city. This is the airfield to which American helicopters carried bodies to be airlifted to America after the Jonestown disaster. When Johnson gave the Temehri Airfield to Marxist Guyana, he handed Russia a very large plum indeed. The Temehri Airfield is the largest in all of Latin America, larger even than New York's largest airport, the John F. Kennedy Airport; and its location makes it ideal for ferrying Cuban troops and supplies to Africa. As a result, Johnson's action on behalf of the Rockefellers robbed the United States of an important logistic connection to Africa while opening the door for Cuban troops. Our later troubles with Cuban troops in Angola and elsewhere in Africa were partly the result. For a number of years, Russian military activity in Guyana was heavily concentrated around the vicinity of the Temehri Airfield. In 1974, the Russians placed missiles in sites that ringed the airfield. Then the missiles were pulled out from those locations and moved to a separate missile complex west of Georgetown, over the following two years. In that new complex, the missiles were deployed at sites scattered over an area some 30 miles in diameter. In the approximate center was a Command and Control installation commanded by Russian personnel. And the plot began to thicken. After the missile base relocation was completed, the missile complex was centered at a point about 70 miles northwest of Temehri Airfield. It was no accident that the Peoples' Temple kibbutz was located so close to the missile base. At the time the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was established in WW II, Nelson Rockefeller already had a strong presence in Latin America with his own agency called the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. I am reminded of a story told to me by a friend who, as a young German in South America, was arrested for being German and sent to a concentration camp in Texas for the duration of World War II. Later he often returned to South America. He told me of the time he lived near the border of Colombia and Venezuela and admired the huge beautiful field of flowers owned by Rockefeller. Did you know that Rockefeller loved flowers and was in the flower business? What kind of flowers, you ask? POPPIES! ORIGINS OF THE PEOPLES' TEMPLE The origins of the Peoples' Temple in the 1950s had nothing to do with government intrigues. It was not until about 1970 that certain elements of the United States intelligence community began to infiltrate and subvert the Peoples' Temple. The Rockefeller brothers have always had a standard practice of supporting not only the faction in power but also spies and opponents to that faction - and who doesn't want a little \"free\" funding and support money?

The Rockefeller brothers have always had a standard practice of supporting not only the faction in power but also spies and opponents to that faction - and who doesn't want a little \"free\" funding and support money? In this manner they are always in a position, at least theoretically, to cut down anyone who tries to break free of their control. In the case of Guyana, the Rockefellers wanted to have such a tool in Guyana as a check on Forbes Burnham, the Prime Minister, whom they had put in power with the use of their money. Certain elements within the United States intelligence community under general coordination by the CIA were given the task of finding ways of accomplishing this. In the course of evaluating various options, it was concluded that the Peoples' Temple would prove ideal. The psychological profile of the leader, Jim Jones, indicated that he could be converted into a powerful tool of the Unseen Rulers. Contrary to reports in the controlled major media, Jim Jones was born a Jew, and he already exhibited tendencies toward kibbutz-style organization that could be channeled into useful directions. This would be brought about through a combination of both conscious and unconscious factors. At the conscious level, money and powerful political support would be channeled in his direction; at the unconscious level, the technique of psychological programming would be employed. Gradually, Jim Jones would lose control of his own personality and become what our Unseen Rulers wanted him to be. The process would inevitably create tremendous internal conflicts and turn Jim Jones into a troubled and dangerous man. CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR By 1973, changes in Jones' behavior began to be noticed by his friends and followers. His conversion into a semi-conscious agent of death and intrigue was underway in earnest by that time. That same year the mushrooming funds of the Peoples' Temple were used to launch the agricultural kibbutz at Jonestown, Guyana, though only a few people went there at that time. Guyana was a rigid Marxist police state, and no one could have launched a new enterprise like the Commune without its approval by Forbes Burnham; but David Rockefeller agents made sure that Burnham received all the assurances he needed that the Jones compound would fit neatly into the Marxist environment of Guyana. At the same time, Forbes Burnham had begun double-crossing David Rockefeller, exactly as had been feared. He was now playing ball politically but he was hiding much of Guyana's gold production in caves in the mountains. David Rockefeller found this out sometime later, but by then the much bigger problem was developing from a double-cross by Russia so Burnham was left", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:116:61cf2284e24d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9816, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "received all the assurances he needed that the Jones compound would fit neatly into the Marxist environment of Guyana.

David Rockefeller found this out sometime later, but by then the much bigger problem was developing from a double-cross by Russia so Burnham was left untouched in order to make way for bigger things. By summer 1974, the Rockefeller brothers were still soundly in bed with the Kremlin, and there were already ominous signs that something was happening in Russia which they did not understand; but they simply could not imagine that their old Kremlin allies, the Bolsheviks, were being overthrown. Public warnings about Guyana missiles were denied or ignored. The planned and programmed Nuclear War was being blueprinted for the late 1970s and they did not want the plan to be spoiled by public awareness; but two years later Russia's all-out military double-cross of America began with the Underwater Missile Crisis of 1976, another story for another time. MAJOR TARGET The Guyana missile base was one of the major targets of the revised planning. When this planning began more than two years prior, the Space Battle of the Harvest Moon still lay in the future. It seemed quite inconceivable that America could lose its secret beam-weapons base which was soon to be operational on the Moon; and so long as they had this Moon Base to depend on, our Unseen Rulers thought they could not lose. But in light of the Underwater Missile double cross, they wanted to be able to pull as many of Russia's military teeth as possible. In this way, their destruction of Russia would be even more complete than originally planned. The planners of Operation Guyana were given a difficult problem to solve. The objective was to wipe out the Russian missile base in Guyana by removing the threat it posed to the Panama Canal and southern American cities; but this was to be a pre-war operation carried out covertly and with complete surprise. It had to be covertly, because neither the United States nor Russia could afford to have it known that the base ever existed; and the surprise had to be complete, because with even the briefest warning the base could be reinforced and defended by Cuban troops. From these requirements it was concluded that a commando-style raid would be necessary, something like the Israeli raid at Entebbe Airport in Uganda in July 1976. Any other kind of attack would have required our leaders to do what President Kennedy did in 1962, that is, tell the American people what was afoot and ask for our support. At all costs, the one thing our Unseen Rulers were determined not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:117:64a11bc947a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9817, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 118, "text": "the base could be reinforced and defended by Cuban troops.

At all costs, the one thing our Unseen Rulers were determined not to do was to tell us anything. The problem then arose - how to get the joint attacking forces into Guyana in a force large enough and fast enough to do the job without betraying their hand. Wiping out a base like that one in Guyana, after all, was no small task. It was then concluded that somehow some very sudden, massive, compelling excuse would have to be provided in order to enable the secret joint military to enter Guyana temporarily. The excuse, whatever it was, would have to be so visible as to tie Russia's hands so that Russia could not retaliate in Guyana without giving away what she had been up to there; and the excuse would have to appear non-military yet require military expertise. Furthermore, some provision would have to be made for ALL casualties in the missile-base attack to be removed from Guyana after the raid, otherwise their presence in Guyana could have been made the basis of an international incident trumped up around some different story unrelated to the secret missile base. For example, the government of Guyana, following Russian dictates, might have publicly displayed the bodies of the joint military forces killed in the attack and said they were killed in an attempted coup d'etat against Forbes Burnham. It was a very big order, but the Jonestown kibbutz proved to be the answer. All that was necessary was to arrange for many hundreds of American citizens to die *suddenly* in Guyana and under conditions guaranteeing instant massive publicity. The sheer enormity of the tragedy would require military involvement, and the location of Jonestown was made to order. Helicopters commuting between the Temehri Airfield and Jonestown would naturally fly over the missile complex - whose details were known in spite of expert camouflage. This meant that joint special armed forces could be set down near the perimeters of the missile base and later recovered, along with casualties, with relative ease. And as the reporters at the Temehri Airfield watched helicopters leaving to the northwest and return from the same direction, they were led to assume that all were going to and from Jonestown some 150 miles away. They had no way of knowing that many of the flights were to and from the Russian missile base, which lay in the same direction but only half as far distant.

They had no way of knowing that many of the flights were to and from the Russian missile base, which lay in the same direction but only half as far distant. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHEME When it was decided to use mass deaths at Jonestown as a cover for the missile-base attack, Jonestown was functioning only as an outpost of the Peoples' Temple. There were not enough people there to provide a sufficiently major incident to serve the intended purpose, and so, through both direct and indirect means, Jim Jones was persuaded to go to the Guyana kibbutz himself, taking as many of his flock as would follow him. That turned out to be about 25% to 30%, and by following him they automatically identified themselves as the group most highly dependent upon Jones personally. They were also most susceptible to the combined influences of exhaustion, intimidation, and isolation from outside help - in other words, just right for thorough brainwashing. Ever since the days of the Korean War it had been known conclusively that brainwashing techniques can cause many people to do all kinds of things. Even hardened American GIs in Korea fell victim to brainwashing in surprising numbers because they did not understand what they were up against. The Jonestown victims were anything but hardened soldiers. In August 1977, Jim Jones left for Guyana with his large sacrificial flock. That same month, United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young carried a message to Prime Minister Forbes Burnham of Guyana. He said that under certain conditions the United States and the World Bank would increase its aid to Guyana - that is, line Burnham's pocket by a factor of ten times more than previous levels. And so the key disaster of Jonestown was set into motion shortly before the Battle of the Harvest Moon. POOR LEO RYAN To trigger the whole tragedy and in a blare of publicity, the interest of late Congressman Leo J. Ryan was developed and programmed. In a display of courage that is practically unknown today in the U.S. Congress, Ryan went to Guyana knowing that it might be dangerous. But what he did not know, of course, was that he had been lured into making a trip whose tragic outcome was planned well in advance. Congressman Ryan and those who died with him at Port Kaituma Airport were casualties in the secret war that was leading up to Nuclear War One. And so were the hundreds of other American civilians who died in the so-called \"mass suicide\" at Jonestown, Guyana.

And so were the hundreds of other American civilians who died in the so-called \"mass suicide\" at Jonestown, Guyana. As the time approached for Congressman Ryan to make his anticipated trip to Guyana, other activities were set in motion on the diplomatic and military state. It was essential that Russia's attention be diverted away from Guyana until too late to take action to protect the missile base. Russia's prize in the Western Hemisphere, of course, is Cuba; and so in the final days before the Battle of Guyana on Thanksgiving Day 1978, the trumped up MIG-23 crisis was used to divert Russian attention to Cuba. Only too late did the Kremlin discover that the real target was not Cuba but Guyana. PART 19: THE BATTLE OF THANKSGIVING DAY 1978 Close aides of the late Congressman Leo Ryan have reported publicly that his ill-fated decision to go to Guyana was triggered by a State Department report to him that he found totally unsatisfactory. This reaction of Ryan's had been correctly predicted and, in fact, deliberately encouraged. With elections coming up, Congressman Ryan decided to schedule the trip after the election during the Congressional recess. This was a quite natural decision, and had also been anticipated by the planners behind the scenes. No politician would miss the opportunity to campaign right up to election day. As the time approached for his trip, the false issue of the Cuban MIG-23 crisis erupted. The Carter Administration had learned nearly a year prior that the Russians were going to send the MIG-23s to Cuba and decided that it would be a perfect pretext for a fake crisis. The MIG-23 can carry certain types of nuclear weapons as claimed; but even this role it is a tactical weapon best suited for support of ground or naval forces. The MIG-23 in and of itself did not threaten America in the same way that the 1962 Cuban missiles did, and so when the United States began playing up the MIG-23s, it was very obvious to the Kremlin that this was a deliberate effort to stir up public tension over Cuba. The questions were: Exactly what was the United States up to? Would the Carter Administration be so crazy as to invade Cuba? Such a thing sounded irrational, but America's Unseen Rulers were behaving more and more irrationally. This, too, was partially deliberate and was intended to keep the chess players in the Kremlin off balance, but it was also partly a result of the increasing degree of control over America by those Satanic schizophrenics, the Bolsheviks. Cuba was, after", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:120:3402fd2bce6b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9820, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "Cuba.

This, too, was partially deliberate and was intended to keep the chess players in the Kremlin off balance, but it was also partly a result of the increasing degree of control over America by those Satanic schizophrenics, the Bolsheviks. Cuba was, after all, very important to Russia, for Russia was looking ahead to world domination after Nuclear War I; and for that, Cuba is Russia's main beach-head in the Western Hemisphere. Even more urgently, Cuba was the unadmitted home of Russia's Caribbean Submarine Fleet, and that fleet had repeatedly moved into attack positions in the Gulf of Mexico over the prior two years and more during periods of tension. As if that were not enough, there were concentrations of nuclear weapons in at least four land locations in Cuba. One was near the north coast roughly 10 miles inland southeast of Cardenas. This location is 150 miles due south of Cape Sable, Florida. A second site was about 150 miles to the east-southeast of that and about 10 miles inland from the north coast. One hundred twenty five miles farther to the southeast was a third concentration 15 miles northeast of Marti, well inland. A fourth nuclear site was near the eastern tip of Cuba, 18 miles north-northwest of the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. With all this at stake, American publicity over the MIG-23s caused worry in the Kremlin. And in early November the tension increased when the United States began sending SR-71 reconnaissance flights over Cuba - shades of 1962 and the U-2. In response, massive formations from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean Submarine Fleets of the Russian Navy began fanning out along America's east, west, and gulf coasts on November 6. They did not deploy into attack formations but their sheer numbers signaled a clear warning to Washington. At that moment they were still on station, many with neutron weaponry. Then during the week immediately preceding the tragedies in Guyana the MIG-23 pseudo crisis built to a climax. Beginning on Tuesday, November 14, a huge combined American and British naval Task Force began heading toward Cuba. By midweek, Cuban defense forces were on full alert, and on Thursday, November 16, a group of twelve United States Senators in Moscow - supposedly to discuss the SALT talks - met with Russia's Kosygin. There they pressed the alleged issue of the Cuban MIG-23 argument, calling it a \"false issue.\" As a former test pilot and America's first astronaut in orbit, Senator John Glenn knew what he was talking about, but Kosygin's anger over the other comments about the MIGs provided the United States intelligence community with valuable proof that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:121:49f6b0337921", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9821, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "Thursday, November 16, a group of twelve United States Senators in Moscow - supposedly to discuss the SALT talks - met with Russia's Kosygin.

The next day, November 17, Russia publicly admitted sending MIG-23s to Cuba, calling them strictly defensive weapons. The same day an editorial in the *Washington Post* typified the crescendo of media attention to the Cuban MIG-23s. It was titled: \"A New Cuban Missile Crisis?\" The very next day, Saturday, November 18, Congressman Leo Ryan, three newsmen and a woman seeking to escape from Jonestown were slaughtered at the Port Kaituma Airport. At least a dozen other people were also wounded, but there was no effort to destroy the airplane filled with terrified escapees from Jonestown. Instead, many witnesses were left alive, and a smaller plane managed to take off right after the airport massacre and report the attack in the capital, Georgetown. Immediately world attention was focused on Guyana, and meanwhile the mass murder at Jonestown - wrongly called a mass suicide - was underway. At this point, the elaborate decoy action toward Cuba was no longer needed, so the Pentagon announced that a routine naval exercise was in progress which would approach no closer to Cuba than 50 miles. Cuban defense forces relaxed, but the real action was only beginning in Guyana. The methodical executions of Congressman Ryan and three prominent newsmen had guaranteed that Jonestown would shortly be in the glare of publicity. Having guaranteed this publicity, Jim Jones then ordered the mass executions at the Jonestown kibbutz. DETAILS OF MASSACRE The complete details of the Jonestown disaster may never be known publicly. It is certain, however, that very few if any of those who died there willingly took their own lives. Some were tricked, not realizing that the death rites were real. Many more resisted, but they were weak, helpless, and confronted with armed execution squads. So by various means, several hundred people were poisoned with potassium cyanide, many by being forcibly injected. Many more fled into the jungle, where U.S. Army Green Berets and British SAS special forces troops tracked them down and killed them with a shot to the temple. Finally, when the mass murder was completed, the executioners performed their final task of stage-managing the horrible death scene. In order to achieve the surprise needed in attacking the Russian missile base, it was critically important that the first reports from Jonestown described the scene as a mass suicide. Only in this way could its actual military significance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:122:eab69a297f5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9822, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "U.S. Army Green Berets and British SAS special forces troops tracked them down and killed them with a shot to the temple.

In order to achieve the surprise needed in attacking the Russian missile base, it was critically important that the first reports from Jonestown described the scene as a mass suicide. Only in this way could its actual military significance be hidden long enough to fool the Russians. Therefore, all the bodies free of gunshot wounds were carefully arranged in neat rows and other groupings, suggesting at first sight that everyone died willingly and deliberately. This was the scene that greeted Guyanese troops late the following day, Sunday, November 19. It was more than 24 hours after the kibbutz victims died and the executioners, including the real Jim Jones, were long gone. Jim Jones did not die at Jonestown. COUNTERS AFRAID OF DISEASE The Guyanese troops were afraid of possible disease but counted the bodies as accurately as possible without close handling or moving the bodies. The total they reported was 409 on that Sunday night. The initial impression of a mass suicide was seized upon by the controlled major media of the United States. Without waiting for an investigation, the media drummed away at the suicide image of Jonestown as if it were a proven fact. After a few days a few people did begin to raise questions, but by then the initial image of suicide had served its purpose of opening Guyana's doors to the United States. For example, on Tuesday, November 21, Jim Jones' surviving son, Steven, said in a Georgetown press conference, \"There's no way it could have been mass suicide.\" And that same day, according to the *Washington Star,* a Guyanese source pointed out a serious medical discrepancy in the Jonestown kibbutz death scene. He said, \"If you die of cyanide, which seems to have been the poison, your body goes into spasm and contortion death, but at Jonestown everyone looked totally relaxed.\" The reason for this discrepancy was that by the time the Guyanese troops arrived, all the bodies had been rearranged. They were also placed face down for the most part. This was so that the widely publicized news photos would not ruin the desired impression of calm by letting you see the victims' final expression of agony. THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED To continue the nightmare charade to fool the Russians, the United States at first publicly urged Guyana to collect and bury the hundreds of bodies. As arranged, Guyana replied in effect that it was America's problem and that America should take the bodies back to the United States - just as planned. To facilitate this huge and hideous task, Guyana obligingly agreed to waive the usual Guyanese law that requires any body", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:123:60f56220aac5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9823, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 124, "text": "victims' final expression of agony.

To facilitate this huge and hideous task, Guyana obligingly agreed to waive the usual Guyanese law that requires any body to be autopsied before removal from the country. With this arrangement, the United States achieved the carte blanche military access to Guyana that was needed. Russian intelligence realized what was afoot by early Monday, November 20, but it was already too late to stop it. Russia could hardly announce to the world that, \"We have a secret nuclear missile base in Guyana and the United States is getting ready to destroy it.\" That would have rallied world opinion behind America; and, although Russian Cosmoshperes quickly converged over Guyana, they, too, were useless in the covert conditions of battle there. Their Charged Particle Beam Weapons could have made short work of the commando-style forces, but in the process they would have wiped out the Russian base itself. The Guyana missiles had become only a minor factor in Russia's military power since the Battle of the Harvest Moon the year prior. They were not valuable enough to Russia to declare open war on their account. And so under these conditions, Russia was powerless to act once the Jonestown tragedy had been staged. As Thanksgiving Day approached, huge American transports, helicopters, troops, and medical teams swarmed into Guyana. In a remote corner of the huge Temehri Airfield a command post was established for the twin operations of Jonestown and the Russian missile base. As some of the troops began the nauseating task of cleaning up the Jonestown kibbutz, other joint attack forces were taking up positions around the missile base in preparations for the surprise raid. Meanwhile, day after day the death count reported at Jonestown remained unchanged at 409. Then on Thanksgiving Day itself, the Battle of Guyana took place. Crack military forces experienced in jungle and surprise warfare moved in on the Russian complex, striking all the dispersed sites simultaneously. Like the Entebbe raid, the battle itself did not last long. It had to be over quickly to be successful. First the small crews on site near each missile were overwhelmed, and then killed. The missiles themselves were quickly disabled. Next the military forces converged on the Missile Command and Control Center, where a bloody pitched battle took place. When the smoke cleared, every single person manning the missile base had been killed, including the Russian commanders. When the battle was over, American helicopters from Temehri Airfield began landing within the ruined missile complex and flying out the wounded. Then the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:124:6911fa5522f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9824, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 125, "text": "the small crews on site near each missile were overwhelmed, and then killed.

When the battle was over, American helicopters from Temehri Airfield began landing within the ruined missile complex and flying out the wounded. Then the remaining attackers were left with two more jobs before they could retire from the area. First, they were under strict orders to leave no bodies in the attacking forces on Guyanese soil, and so the entire area was scoured until every single member of the attacking force had been accounted for. Their bodies, like those of the victims at Jonestown, were sealed in Vietnam-type body bags and collected in clearings where helicopters could land to pick them up. Finally, the combined forces were under orders to remove the nuclear warheads from the missiles and take them back to Georgetown for airlift to the United States. Specially trained members of the attacking force had set to work on this task immediately after the initial attacks on the missile crews. By early Friday, November 24, all the warheads had been removed. They, too, were placed in body bags, one per bag, with some jungle foliage stuffed in to give the bag a reasonable appearance. Of course none of this war was apparent to the reporters at Temehri Airfield, whose access to the American Command Post there was carefully controlled. When wounded members of the attacking force were flown back to the Airfield, after the Battle of Guyana on Thanksgiving afternoon, they were kept out of sight of the reporters. Otherwise, when reporters occasionally saw body bags being moved from place to place they just naturally assumed that all contained victims from Jonestown. They had no way of knowing that some contained slain Commandoes and that others contained Russian nuclear warheads. The continual cargo of death from the Jonestown kibbutz made the perfect cover for the aftermath of the Battle of Guyana. WHERE COULD THEY TAKE ALL THOSE BODIES? Many reporters were totally puzzled at the choice of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the Guyana airlift. Most of the Jonestown victims were from California, and there is a mortuary facility, similar to the Dover facility, at Oakland Air Force Base in California. Dover was chosen to facilitate transfer of the Russian nuclear warheads to the nearby Aberdeen Proving Ground and Arsenal. This was done by means of shallow flights from Dover to Phillips Air Force Base. Originally the Guyanese count of 409 had been accepted as firm by United States officials in Guyana. That had raised questions as to where the rest of the one thousand or so residents reported to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:125:ff855531ea0f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9825, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "to the Dover facility, at Oakland Air Force Base in California.

That had raised questions as to where the rest of the one thousand or so residents reported to be in Jonestown had gone. Finally, on Thanksgiving Day, with the body clean-up operation well under way, a military spokesman told reporters, \"The evaluation that we have made is simply that there were not many more people in Jonestown at the time of the suicide.\" But even as he spoke, the Battle of Guyana was raging at the Russian missile base. By midday on Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, 485 body bags had already arrived at the Temehri Airfield. The \"bodies\" of warheads from the Russian missile base were destined to raise the total far beyond the total of 409 bodies originally counted by the Guyanese at the kibbutz. It was a bad mistake, the kind of thing that happens in the heat of battle. Something had to be done, and quickly. So, on that Friday after Thanksgiving, a breathless and nervous Pentagon spokesman at the Temehri Airfield made a stunning announcement over CBS television [some of us call it CIABS Television, don't we, Dan Rather?]: \"The original count of persons found dead at the Jonestown site has been found to be seriously in error. It now appears there may be as many as 780 bodies, total, found at the site. They were found simply buried under other bodies. There were larger adults that were grouped together, and under their bodies were found bodies, and under their bodies were found the bodies of smaller adults and children.\" Rather a curious mass suicide, I would say. Badgered by incredulous reporters, the Government embellished the cover story later on. The *Washington Star* quoted the same spokesman as saying Friday night: \"Near the center of the pile of bodies, near the assembly hall, they were three deep in some areas. They were in layers with blankets between them.\" Wasn't it just nice of all those people to fall over in well orchestrated and neat rows? The story was so unbelievable that within two days the United States Government dismissed its own story about the blankets as a \"rumor.\" Still the basic idea of bodies on top of bodies had to be maintained, so on Saturday, November 25, another Air Force spokesman tried to make it all sound plausible in the following words: \"From what I observed, the people, when they committed suicide, would line up in nice neat little circles, children in front of them, and as they died they folded into the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:126:398ea15276da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9826, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "days the United States Government dismissed its own story about the blankets as a \"rumor.\" Still the basic idea of bodies on top of bodies had to be maintained, so on Saturday, November 25, another Air Force spokesman tried to make it all sound plausible in the following words: \"From what I observed, the people, when they committed suicide, would line up in nice neat little circles, children in front of them, and as they died they folded into the interior of the circle.\" Even though the story kept getting curiouser and curiouser, nearly everybody accepted it hook, line, sinker and fish! The Guyana cover-up was world-wide in its dimensions - it had to be. In Guyana, Deputy Prime Minister Reid made the first public announcement to the Guyanese people about Jonestown on Friday afternoon, November 24, in parliament. Then he refused to answer questions, and rushed out to cries of \"Shame, Shame\" and \"Cover-up\" from parliament members. And in the United States on Thanksgiving Day, FBI Director William Webster said that the: \"FBI disaster squad had positively identified the body of James Warren Jones through fingerprint identification records.\" This was a lie, and at that moment Jim Jones was making good his preplanned escape from Guyana. HOW DID JIM JONES GET OUT? The plans for removal of Jones were laid well in advance. An ocean-going boat, well stocked with supplies and money, was waiting for him near the river town of Bartica, 35 miles southwest of Georgetown. In order to make his way to Bartica from Jonestown, Jones had a Safe Conduct Pass. In the early morning of Thanksgiving Day, as the Battle of Guyana was beginning, Jones headed downstream toward Georgetown. Shortly after noon Guyana time his boat left the mouth of the Essequibo River into the Atlantic Ocean. From there Jones followed a complicated itinerary which was designed to prevent his being followed; but in spite of that, he was followed. From Guyana Jones headed due east for about 330 miles and then turned south, landing near La Mere, French Guyana, at about 5:30 A.M. local time, November 27. From there he traveled by land to the capital of Cayenne, and took an airplane across the Atlantic Ocean to Freetown, Sierra Bissau Airport, arriving there approximately 7:00 P.M. local time, November 28. There, less than two hours later, he boarded a DC-3 and took off. His route took him eastward to Tambacounda, (Senegal); from there onward into Mali with stops at Segou, Mopti, and Gao; then onward to Agadez (Niger), and Largeau (Chad). From there his plane continued to Atbaqra (Sudan), and then a short final hop to Port Sudan where he arrived shortly after 4:00 A.M., November 30, local time. When he arrived at Port Sudan, Jones found a Turboprop Executive Transport waiting for him which was owned and operated by Israeli Intelligence.

When he arrived at Port Sudan, Jones found a Turboprop Executive Transport waiting for him which was owned and operated by Israeli Intelligence. Within 20 minutes the plane took off with Jones and headed up the middle of the Red Sea toward the Gulf of Aqaba. At 6:30 A.M. local time on November 30, Jones' plane landed briefly at Elath, the back door to Israel; then on to a private airport outside of Jerusalem, arriving at 7:20 A.M. local time. From there he headed to a nearby location for an intelligence briefing. I have information that Jones was in Israel for about 7 or 8 years then was killed by his \"keepers\" as being too dangerous to have around. However, I have other information that conflicts with this, so I do not know his current status. I have heard preachers giving sermons making a point by telling about Jim Jones and Jonestown. They are really just snorting in the wind; they have no notion of truth and are merely reinforcing the brainwashing that has been laid upon them. PART 20: LT. COL. JAMES \"BO\" GRITZ AND JONESTOWN The officer in charge of all U.S. Army Special Forces for Latin America at the time of the Jonestown holocaust was Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz. Gritz was the original soldier after which the movie character \"Rambo\" was patterned. Gritz was the most decorated soldier to come out of the Vietnam war. The Guyana massacre was carried out by Bo Gritz' men (along with British SAS troops). *Flatland* (#10) magazine, in an interview with Gritz, asked him: Question: You trained Special Forces that went into Jonestown? What was the precise nature of the operation? \"I don't know precisely because it was a compartmentalized operation. The only thing that I do know for certain is what the Sergeant I quote coming out of Jonestown, he was insistent because he was disgusted, on writing this book. He was, without compromise, going to call it *All the Niggers Are Dead.* I asked him, 'Why would you want to entitle anything such an offensive way?' 'It doesn't make a difference what your color, your creed, your sex,' he said, 'when you are treated the way they were, that's what you are; you're a nigger, you're nothing else.' I think that those soldiers saw things that affected them and made them very angry. I've seen other things like that in combat where there have been abuses.

I wrote about one of them in my book where the Captain tortured the young severely and the young Sergeant put on a swastika and said, \"If I'm going to act like a Nazi I'm going to look like one.' I think that the same kind of negative impact occurred in Jonestown.\" Gritz has more about Jonestown in his autobiography, *Called to Serve.* Perhaps you simply cannot believe what I am telling you. Will you believe it if told to you by the Green Beret officer in charge of the men who did the killing? He admits that the information was \"compartmentalized\" and it was not until later that he learned what his men were actually doing. The following information is from pages 584-587 of his book: \"The true story of the Jonestown camp in Guyana has been brought to light through an extensive investigation conducted by John Judge, from Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and other dedicated researchers and investigators. The truth, which was thoroughly suppressed by the American media, is that it was actually a slave-labor camp run by Jones with the assistance of the CIA. Most of the information which follows is from John Judge's summary of the investigation, supplemented with information provided by Special Forces teams I had earlier trained and commanded, who were sent in to 'clean up the remains of Jonestown.' \"Most of the black and Hispanic poor people and social activists who became the inmates of the camp were brought there either by force or coercion, or lured under false pretenses, where extensive experiments of drug-induced mind control were performed on them. Even before they were moved to Guyana, reports of beatings, kidnappings, sexual abuse and mysterious deaths had leaked out to the press about the earlier Peoples' Temple in Ukiah, California. \"Jim Jones had a very interesting past which was overlooked by the media: During the time his friend Dan Mitrione was teaching torture techniques to the Brazilian and Argentineans, Jones was also sent to Brazil where his house, transportation and groceries were provided to him by the U.S. Embassy, and he frequently traveled to Belo Horizonte, the CIA headquarters in Brazil. \"Jones had been contacted in Ukiah by 'Christian missionaries' from World Vision (World Vision is a CIA controlled front operation), an evangelical order which had performed espionage work for the CIA in Southeast Asia. Most of Jones' top lieutenants were from wealthy, educated backgrounds, many with connections to the military or intelligence agencies.

Most of Jones' top lieutenants were from wealthy, educated backgrounds, many with connections to the military or intelligence agencies. These were the people who were involved in setting up the bank accounts, complex legal transactions and financial agreements which put people under the control of the Peoples' Temple. \"Some of Jones' Lieutenants were: Dr. Lawrence Layton was chief of Chemical and Biological Warfare Research at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah for many years and later worked as Director of Missile and Satellite Development at the Navy Propellant Division at Indian Head, Maryland. His wife, Lisa, was the daughter of Hugo Phillips, who had represented the huge Nazi manufacturing cartel, I.G. Farben, as a stockbroker. Their daughter, Debbie, met and married George Philip Blakey, whose parents had extensive stock holdings in Solve Drugs, a division of I.G. Farben. \"Blakey was reputed to be training mercenaries in Jonestown who were sent to work with CIA-backed UNITA forces in Angola. Terri Buford's father, Admiral Charles T. Buford, worked with Naval Intelligence. Marie Katsaris' father was minister with the Greek Orthodox Church, thought to be a conduit of CIA funding, and she claimed she had proof he was a CIA agent. The 'official survivors' were represented upon their return to the U.S. by Joseph Blatchford, an attorney who had been named in a prior scandal involving CIA infiltration of the Peace Corps. \"The people who were taken from San Francisco to begin their 'new life' in Guyana were bussed to Florida and arrived in Guyana bound and gagged, where they were forced to work 16 hours or more daily, and were fed on minimum rations. As more and more rumors began to filter back to the United States of druggings, beatings, torture, sexual humiliations and coercion at the Guyana site, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to go to Guyana and verify the situation for himself. \"Ryan had challenged the CIA's overseas operations before, as a member of the House Committee responsible for oversight on intelligence. He was co-author of the controversial Hughes-Ryan Amendment, which would have required advance CIA disclosure to the congressional committees of all planned covert operations. The amendment would be defeated shortly after his death in Jonestown. \"With Ryan on the way to Jonestown, the secrecy surrounding the camp would be broken and desperate measures would need to be taken to keep the truth from escaping, much less the inmates. In a futile attempt to test their conditioning methods, the leaders at Jonestown apparently tried to implement an actual suicide drill, but it was obviously ignored.

In a futile attempt to test their conditioning methods, the leaders at Jonestown apparently tried to implement an actual suicide drill, but it was obviously ignored. Official stories first numbered the victims at 408, but later revised the toll upward to 913. It was claimed that some 505 bodies had been covered by those of the first 408 who had fallen directly on top of them, confusing those who had been counting from aerial photographs. - a blatant and ridiculous attempt at cover-up. \"However, the first reports were true - 408 had died, and 700 fled to the jungle where British Black Watch troops and American Special Forces were conducting 'training exercises.' Of the 700, 505 who had been deliberately shot in the jungle were added to the count of those who had supposedly committed suicide by drinking cyanide-laced Kool Aid. \"The truth is that nearly 400 inmates were forced to die by injection, according to the Chief Guyanese medical examiner, Dr. Mootoo, who arrived at Jonestown within hours of the massacre. He found needle marks on the left shoulder blades of 80-90% of the victims, and the others had been shot or strangled. \"As Chief Medical Examiner, Mootoo's testimony to the Guyanese Grand Jury led to their conclusion that all but three of the people who had died at Jonestown were murdered by 'persons unknown.' Several pictures show the gunshot wounds on the bodies as well. The U.S. Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Schuler, told the press, 'No autopsies are needed. The cause of death is not an issue here,' and the forensic doctors who later performed the autopsies at Dover, Delaware, were never made aware of Dr. Mootoo's findings. \"Guyanese troops discovered a large cache of drugs, enough to control the entire population of Georgetown, Guyana (pop. 200,000), for over a year. One footlocker contained 11,000 doses of Thorazine, a dangerous tranquilizer, and others such as sodium pentothal (truth serum), chloral hydrate (a hypnotic), demerol, Thallium (confuses thinking), haliopareael and Largatil (powerful tranquilizers) and many others. It was very evident that Jonestown was a tightly-run concentration camp, complete with medical and psychiatric experimentation. \"Direct orders to cover up the cause of death came from the top levels of the American Government. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security advisor, authorized Robert Pastor to order Lt. Col. Gordon Sumner to strip the bodies of the medical bracelets they had been forced to wear for identification.

While the Secrecy Act prevented him from detailing all that went on, SFC Inman carefully hid the entire story within his title: *All The Niggers Are Dead!* When I asked that he explain the crudeness of so naming his report, he replied, 'Sir, that's what they were. Both blacks and whites were niggers; that's what any slave is; that's what they were. That was our final radio message when the job we were assigned was finished.' I could tell by his bitterness that the government had no fear that the book would ever be printed. He just needed someone to vent his anger on. \"Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham rose to power as the result of a CIA-inspired coup against the recalcitrant Guyanese leader Cheddi Jagan. Richard Dwyer, a CIA agent working as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Guyana, was shown to have been at the scene at the time of the massacre and at the airport strip, where he failed to order Guyanese troops, armed with machine guns, to defend Ryan and his staff. \"Chief Consular Officer Richard McCoy, who was described as 'close to [Jim] Jones,' worked for military intelligence and was 'on loan' from the Defense Department at the time of the massacre. Dan Webber, who was sent to the Jonestown site the day after, was also named as a CIA agent. \"U.S. Ambassador John Burke, who had served in the CIA since 1963 and had worked with Dwyer in Thailand, according to Philip Agee, tried to stop Ryan's investigation. The State Department concealed all reports of violations at Jonestown from Congressman Leo Ryan, while the Embassy regularly provided Jones with copies of all congressional inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act. \"According to current reports, Jonestown has been 're-populated' with over 1,000 Laotion Hmong people who grew opium and served under General Vang Pao during our 'secret war' in Laos and Cambodia.

It may only be a matter of time before another Jonestown is exposed. It is sad to know that what started out to be an information gathering organization has turned into an instrument of the dragon.\" PART 21: IN THE BEGINNING... In the March 1919 issue of *Electrical Experimenter* magazine, details of the Roger's underground communication system were released. This system was later classified SECRET and used to communicate with submarines during World War I. It involved using frequencies through the ground and water. The signals were 5,000 times stronger than signals through the air. The patents are confusing to most engineers, but to someone who understands, it is obvious that the transmitters were using scalar waves. If you wonder if it could be possible for scientists to devise the type of technology written about in the early *Fire From The Sky* articles, you need to be aware that this technology has been around for a long time. Actually, for a very long time. For instance, in 1977, Louis Kervran won the Nobel Prize for showing that plants and animals (his main experiments were with chickens) use \"scalar wave\" type technology to transmute elements, for instance, turning potassium into calcium. This is impossible according to the \"laws\" of physics currently taught in schools. The ruling Elite does not want you \"common folk\" to have this type of knowledge, as it will undermine their control over you. So the \"laws\" they teach are WRONG. While the oil barons sabotaged Nikola Tesla's efforts to provide cheap or free energy to the world, the Russians took an interest in his material and developed it. Nikita Kruschev asked his physicists, specifically Pyorte (Peter) Kapitsa, to develop a system for total defense against missiles and aircraft. By studying Tesla and others they were successful and, in 1960, Kruschev announced the development of a \"fantastic\" Soviet weapon, one that could destroy all life on the world. (\"Kruschev Says Soviets Will Cut Forces a Third; Sees 'Fantastic Weapon',\" by Max Frankel, *New York Times,* Jan. 15, 1960, p. 1.)

However, it was not quite ready and in 1962 Kruschev was forced to back down during the Cuban Missile Crisis. This caused him to lose much face with his government and people. U.S.S. THRESHER AND THE U-2 As things were not going well with Kruschev, he decided to use the weapons system before it was fully operational and on April 10, 1963, he successfully detected and destroyed the nuclear submarine *U.S.S. Thresher,* using an underwater scalar howitzer. The next day, they celebrated by firing a pulse blast creating a tremendous underwater explosion about 100 miles north of Puerto Rico, south of where they had sunk the *Thresher.* Col. Tom Bearden described the event: \"It left a signature: the sub's surface companion, the *U.S.S. Skylark,* was in the splatter zone of the underwater scalar interference. That is, spurious EM noise was being generated in all the *Skylark's* electrical systems, some of which were actually disabled. So intense was the \"electronic jamming\" that it required over an hour and a half for the *Skylark* to transmit an emergency message back to its headquarters that the *Thresher* was in serious trouble and contact with it had been lost. Some of the *Skylark's* communication systems actually failed, but later resumed operation inexplicably, once the jamming was gone. That type of \"jamming\" of multiple bands and multiple electronic equipment, of course, together with the anomalous failure of electronic equipment and its later mysterious recovery, were direct signatures of the use of the exothermic scalar interferometer against the undersea target area in the vicinity of the *Skylark.* \"The very next day, April 11, 1963, the same Soviet scalar EM howitzer system was tested in the \"destroy submarine\" pulse mode. A huge underwater EM blast occurred off the coast of Puerto Rico, about 100 miles north of the island. The underwater explosion caused a huge boiling up of a giant mushroom of water about a third of a mile high. The mushroom of water then fell back into the ocean, completing the signature. \"Fortunately the entire incident was seen by the startled crew of a passing U.S. jetliner which was just passing its checkpoint in that area.\" (See Robert J. Durant, \"An Underwater Explosion - or What?\" *Pursuit,* 5(2), April 1972, p. 30-31.) For more information on the *Thresher* disaster and *Skylark* problems, see John Bentley, *The Thresher Disaster,* Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y., 1975, particularly p. 164. \"These two incidents were full-up operational tests of Kruschev's newly-deployed superweapons.

Bearden says: \"In fact, Gary Powers' high-flying aircraft was probably shot down in 1960 by a 'jury-rigged' scalar EM howitzer using modified radars and timed scalar pulses to provide an aerial explosion and EMP.\" (*Fer-De-Lance,* by Tom Bearden, p. 65.) END OF PART 21. PART 22: TOTAL RUSSIAN DEFENSE In 1968, the Soviets made a statement in *Military Strategy* that the USSR has achieved a 100% defense, and the West has not (*Sokolovsky,* 3rd Edition). Were they telling the truth, and if so, to what were they referring? It is only a matter of life and death, you know. Dr. Edward Teller said in 1987: \"Today, the Soviets have a monopoly on defense and they intend to keep it. We have done practically nothing about civil defense.\" He also said, \"The Soviets have worked for the past 10 years perfecting laser weapons and now have a laser capable of shooting 1,000 miles without its beam *spreading more than 5 feet\"* (Jan.-Feb. 1987 *Fusion*). PROJECT PAPERCLIP Before we continue in time sequence of what happened, I want to go back and point out some connections you need to know. The earlier *Fire From The Sky* material says that Russia succeeded in developing anti-gravity levitating platforms, which are the same things as commonly called flying saucers. In fact the Soviets used former Nazi scientists to achieve their advances. The Nazis actually originated the \"flying saucers,\" and they got their ideas and information concerning them from extraterrestrials. This is what all the records indicate. I will give you some leads and if you are serious, you can do your own research and prove it to yourself. You don't have to believe me or anyone else - check it out for yourself! For information about the Nazi scientists, I suggest you study material about Project Paperclip. (*Project Paperclip* by Clarence Lasby; *The Torbitt Document* by William Torbitt; *The Nazi Connection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination* by Mae Brussell; etc.) A former member of that operation is a *good friend of mine.* Among the Germans (Austrians) involved in Paperclip was a *Communist spy named Henry Kissinger* - you've heard of him, perhaps?

Another German was Werner von Braun, who was brought to this country and became head of the U.S. space program. Von Braun worked for a German general named Walter Dornberger, and had been an *SS Sturmbannfuhrer* since 1937. Dornberger was in charge of Peenemunde. At the end of the war, von Braun and 115 other German scientists surrendered to the Americans and were brought to Fort Bliss Texas (just across the state line from White Sands Missile Range New Mexico). In 1950 they were transferred to the Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Alabama. Col. Tom Bearden was a nuclear physicist at Redstone Arsenal. Von Braun's original security report said: \"He was an SS officer but no information is available to indicate that he was ardent Nazi. Subject is regarded as a potential security threat by the Military Governor.\" Von Braun played down his SS membership and said that it was only honorary, and that \"his real reason for working in the Nazi missile program, he said, had been the potential usefulness of his machines in 'space travel'\" (*Blowback,* p. 39). Dornberger was convicted as a war criminal, then later was secretly brought to the U.S. at the request of von Braun to High Commissioner John J. McCloy. He went to work for Bell Aircraft (Bell Textron) where he worked on the space program as director of R&D (James \"Bo\" Gritz, *Called to Serve,* p. 511). He was also a special CIA consultant (*The Nazi Hunters,* p. 217). Eventually he served on the board of several aerospace companies. He helped develop a nuclear powered trans-atmospheric vehicle (TAV). These vehicles began operating out of Area 51 in Nevada, and other places. Dornberger became a boss of Bell Aerospace Corporation and had about 30 former Nazi scientists working for him. A man named Stanton Friedman is going around the country saying he has worked on these type of nuclear propulsion systems. He sells videos with photos. McCloy was Assistant Secretary of War and blocked the executions of many Nazi war \"criminals.\" He is the one who was overseer of the internment of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps in California. In 1949 he became High Commissioner in Germany and pardoned convicted war criminals such as Alfred Krupp and Dr. Hjalmar Schact (who went to work for Aristotle Onassis).

OPERATION SUNRISE According to Col. Bo Gritz, former head of U.S. Army Special Forces for Latin America , \"General Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler's chief intelligence officer against the Soviet Union , had struck a deal with the Americans (Called OPERATION SUNRISE ) that was not, for obvious reasons, released to establishment media. The principal negotiators were Allen Dulles and William Casey of the OSS , Sir William Stephenson for the British, and SS General Karl Wolff, head of the Gestapo in Italy and former chief of Heinrich Himmler's personal staff\" (p. 562). Operation SUNRISE developed into Operation OVERCAST with General Walter Dornberger and Werner von Braun, and then became Project PAPERCLIP, BLOODSTONE AND BELARUS, etc. (ibid.). John McCloy, by the way, would later serve the Warren Commission and helped cover up the assassination of JFK. He became head of the World Bank, head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, head of the Ford Foundation, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, and co-author of *Freedom From War, The United States Program For General And Complete Disarmament In A Peaceful World* (Department of State Publication 7277). Von Braun had an assistant named Fred Wolff: \"...that matter had been amply met through Dr. von Braun's suggestions (which Wolff sketched out quickly to receive von Braun's check).\" *War For The Moon* by Martin Caidin, E.P. Dutton, 1959, chapter \"Project Moon,\" p. 61 (this book was illustrated by Fred Wolff). Note above that the head of the Gestapo in Italy , Karl Wolff, was working with von Braun. Was Fred's name originally Karl, or was he a son? We are not talking Smith or Jones here, how many men named Wolff (spelled with two f's) that were close friends of von Braun were there in this very small organization? Gehlen, von Braun and Dornberger continued to have considerable influence on American politics, as evidenced from this quote from *Blowback,* p. 64: \"Gehlen also played a role in the creation of the famous missile gap of the 1950s.

'Gehlen provided us [the CIA] with specific reports on the Soviet ICBM program,' Victor Marchetti says. 'He said, \"We have two reliable reports confirming this,\" and they [the Soviets] have just installed three missiles at that site,' et cetera, claiming that they had contacts among the German scientists captured by the Russians at the end of the war.\" The intelligence reports were transmitted to the Pentagon through interagency channels, and word about the alarming new development eventually leaked from there into the press. \"Walter Dornberger added fuel to this fire in 1955 by publishing alarming speculations that the Soviets might attack from the sea, using shorter-range missiles deployed in floating canisters off the coast of the United States. He was deeply involved in the United States ' own ICBM program at this point, and his opinions were given considerable weight in public discussions.\" PROJECT OVERCAST On July 19, 1945, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a program called Operation Overcast. Under this program, 350 German scientists and technicians would be brought into the United States for a period of six months. The program was labeled Top Secret to keep it from the American public. (Ashman, Charles & Wagman, Robert J., *The Nazi Hunters,* Warner Books, p. 212.) When the Nazi scientists were brought into the U.S., they were first put up at Camp Overcast. Camp Overcast was at Wright Field, which later became famous among UFO researchers as Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, home of the infamous Hangar 18. Even Senator Barry Goldwater was not allowed access to this facility. Rabbi Stephen Wise, head of the American Jewish Congress, discovered that the wife of one of the Wright Field rocket team was a former Nazi Party official and in May 1946 said: \"This operation [Paperclip, formerly called Overcast] is all the more deplorable at a time when officials of our government find every possible reason for failing to fulfill the declared policy of President Truman to rescue as many victims of the Nazi terror as our immigration laws permit... As long as we reward the former servants of Hitler while leaving his victims in DP camps, we cannot even pretend that we are making any real effort to achieve the aims we fought for.\" Rabbi Stephen Wise is also famous for the quote: \"Some call it Communism; I call it Judaism!\" When the Germans were first brought into New York, \"At Port Washing, they lived in comfortable conditions at a castle that had been build by the multimillionaire Jay Gould. They soaked in marble bathtubs and ate in an imposing dining room\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:138:e90fefde5fdb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9838, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "victims in DP camps, we cannot even pretend that we are making any real effort to achieve the aims we fought for.\" Rabbi Stephen Wise is also famous for the quote: \"Some call it Communism; I call it Judaism!\" When the Germans were first brought into New York, \"At Port Washing, they lived in comfortable conditions at a castle that had been build by the multimillionaire Jay Gould. They soaked in marble bathtubs and ate in an imposing dining room\" (p. 203, *American Swastika* by Charles Higham). \"In August 1945, General Walter Bedell Smith's private plane was used to fly Gehlen and five of his general staff to the American capital. They traveled in plain clothes, one of their members using a violin case for a suitcase. It is interesting to note that Bedell Smith was Eisenhower's chief of staff\" (p. 260, *American Swastika*). On March 4, 1946, the operation was changed to Operation Paperclip, with no limits on the time or to the number of Germans. Another German brought in, who was not a scientist, was Otto von Bolschwing. He was educated at the University of London and the University of Breslau. He joined the Nazi Party on April 1, 1932 and developed an import/export business, owned a coal mine, and was involved with several drug companies. When the war broke out, he joined the SS and became an intelligence officer, working with the German branches of General Electric and Standard Oil. He was in charge of important funds that came through Nazi connections with Allen Dulles in the Schroeder Bank of New York. In 1945 he was contacted by the Army CIC and in 1947 was a member of the Gehlen organization. He came to the United States and got a job with Alfred Driscoll, former governor of New Jersey and president of Warner-Lambert drug company. Later he joined the Transinternational Computer Investment Corporation (TCI) in Silicon Valley, California and became vice-president of the company. Reinhard Gehlen worked for TCI during the time he was helping Richard Nixon run for President. MICHAEL PAINE Those who studied the assassination of President Kennedy perhaps will recall that Lee Harvey Oswald's wife Marina was staying with Ruth Paine. On April 30, 1961, Oswald married Marina Pruskova in the Soviet Union. He wrote to U.S. Senator John Tower for help in returning to the United States, and it was granted. Remember, Oswald had denounced and left the United States, then he asked a U.S. Senator for help in returning, and got it! Why did he pick Tower to ask, and why did Tower help him? Tower took Lyndon Johnson's place in the Senate and later became head of the Armed Services Committee. A special non-quota immigrant permit was issued for Oswald's wife. Oswald and Marina arrived in the U.S. on June 13, 1962 and went to Dallas. \"He returned to Dallas on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:139:5216a18e9eae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9839, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "had denounced and left the United States, then he asked a U.S. Senator for help in returning, and got it!

A special non-quota immigrant permit was issued for Oswald's wife. Oswald and Marina arrived in the U.S. on June 13, 1962 and went to Dallas. \"He returned to Dallas on October 2, 1963, and was met by fellow CIA agents George de Mohrenschildt and Ruth and Michael Paine. Michael Paine worked for Nazi war criminal Gen. Walter Dornberger at Bell-Textron in Dallas\" (Gritz, p. 529). Next page - \"Most of Oswald's contacts in Dallas, in fact, were with persons hired by Dornberger.\" The majority of people who testified about Oswald before the Warren Commission were carefully selected Dornberger associates. Gritz says of these very people: \"Eastern European and Russian emigre groups supplied by Gehlen were the personnel initially trained for these missions at a special camp set up at Oberammergau in 1946, under the command of General Sikes and SS General Burckhardt, and with the assistance of Henry Kissinger and Lucius Clay. The camp held 5,000 anti-communist elements who were prepared there and called themselves \"Special Forces\" (p. 564). This was the origin of the U.S. Army Special Forces and on the next page Gritz says: \"Many of the remainder underwent special guerrilla training as Special Forces recruits at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and helped form the nucleus of the present-day Green Berets. They would later be quite at home at their first assignment - the SS Bad Tolz Flint Kaserne in the heart of the Bavarian Alps.\" And on page 566 Gritz says: \"Gehlen's immediate staff of about 350 agents, in fact, were brought en masse to the U.S. Army's Historical Division. Almost all resistance to using Nazi war criminals to accomplish the CIA's missions seemed to have been overcome by the time Allen Dulles became Director in 1953.\" The Nazi SS Death's Head insignia was adopted as the symbol of the U.S. Army Special Forces (p. 567). CIA agent George de Mohrenschildt's boss in the CIA was George Bush. De Mohrenschildt had a close friend, John W. Mecom, who was one of the incorporators of the San Jacinto Fund which was used to launder Bush's drug money. (\"Surreptitious Entry: The CIA's Operations in the United States,\" by Thomas B. Ross of the *Chicago Sun Times* in *The CIA File,* edited by Robert L. Borosage and John Marks (Viking, 1976), and quoted in *The Mafia, CIA & George Bush* by Pete Brewton, p. 317.)

De Mohrenschildt had another friend, Jean de Menil, president of Schlumberger Corporation. Jim Garrison tells of Schlumberger being the source of weapons involved in anti-Castro operations and in Algeria. In 1977, hours after arranging to meet an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, de Mohrenschildt joined the long line of people involved in the Kennedy assassination who \"committed suicide.\" If you have the stomach to check into it, you will find that Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Reagan and Bush *shot* their way into the Presidency. And people keeping a list have identified over 30 people close to President Clinton who have been murdered or at least died under mysterious circumstances. If you count the wars, our Presidents have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. Tell me, friend, are you a Republican or a Democrat? Oswald told a public stenographer that an \"engineer\" (Michael Paine) offered to publish a book about the Soviet Union for Oswald if he would write it. The Paines began to subsidize the Oswalds and later Mrs. Oswald moved in with the Paines, where she and Ruth chatted every day in Russian. Lee Harvey Oswald then went to New Orleans and became involved with the \"Fair Play For Cuba Committee.\" The head of that committed was a Jew named V.T. Lee, real name Tappin. Researchers of Lee Harvey Oswald must take into account the fact that there were several people claiming to be Oswald. While living with the Paines, Oswald practiced shooting with a rifle he kept in their garage. Some say he took a pot-shot at General Walker at this time. In September, it was announced that President Kennedy would visit Dallas, and three weeks later Mrs. Paine called Mr. Truly, the manager of the Texas School Book Depository and got Oswald at job working there, under the name of \"O.H. Lee.\" (*New York Post,* Dec. 10, 1963, p. 22.) END OF PART 22. PART 23: MORE ASSASSINATION CONNECTIONS Immediately after Kennedy was assassinated there were three main investigations launched - by the Texas Attorney General, the FBI, and the U.S. Congress. On Dec. 9, 1963, seventeen days after the assassination, the Communist *Worker* Newspaper demanded that the three investigations be stopped and that only Earl Warren do the investigation. Three days later, President Johnson ordered the three groups to stop and put Earl Warren in charge, exactly as the Communists had ordered. Warren immediately began destroying evidence. While the other groups were finding information of multiple people involved, Arlen Specter came up with the \"magic bullet\" theory to explain what happened.

While the other groups were finding information of multiple people involved, Arlen Specter came up with the \"magic bullet\" theory to explain what happened. No one else supported that theory except Gerald Ford, but that became the conclusion of the Warren Commission. Gerald Ford, whose real name was Leslie Lynch King (*American Heritage Dictionary,* 1979), in his book *Portrait of the Assassin,* page 51, tells about Lee Harvey Oswald being on the payroll of the American Red Cross while in Russia. The current head of the Red Cross is Elizabeth Dole, the wife of Senator Bob Dole. Specter has become prominent recently in the Waco and Ruby Ridge investigations, and is campaigning for President. Does it sound like maybe the Communists were behind the assassination of Kennedy? If only it were that simple! We need to pay attention to who and what these people are, as their names come up in all kinds of strange places. Ruth Paine's husband Michael worked as an engineer at Bell Aerospace for the German ex-General Dornberger, head of research for Bell. Paine was part of the Gehlen operation. Werner von Braun became a close personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover and soon after he came to the U.S. he also became a close personal friend of Lyndon B. Johnson. Von Braun worked with Hoover in security projects at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Redstone Arsenal and later in the National Space Agency. In 1958 Lyndon Johnson, majority leader of the Senate, helped push through the National Space Act, which gave funding to von Braun. The Navy and Air Force were in charge of the U.S. missile programs when Russia launched its Sputnik satellite in October of 1957. Two weeks later, they launched the much larger Sputnik II which carried a dog into space. The Russians had put a six-ton package into orbit, while two months later the Navy tried to launch a three-and-half-pound grapefruit-size satellite on their Vanguard missile. It rose a grand height of four feet and blew up, on national television. Eisenhower was reminded about the little-known bunch of Nazis at Huntsville, so he gave them the go-ahead. Less than two months later, the (ex) Nazis put America's first satellite, Explorer I, into orbit on January 31, 1958. \"Sputnik forced two space agendas on the United States, one public, the other top secret.\" (Burrows, William E., *Deep Black - Space Espionage And National Security,* Random House, 1986, p. 138.)

Reinhard Gehlen was head of the Nazi Abwehr spy organization during WW II, and at the end of the war he approached the OSS and offered to work for them, with his team and records. They accepted and brought many of his team into the U.S. under Projer Paperclip. Gehlen remained chief of the West German Intelligence service until he retired in 1968. Frank Wisner, who worked for Allen Welsh Dulles, was a Wall Street lawyer who became head of Dulles' Secret Intelligence Branch and was responsible for the Gehlen organization. Working with Wisner were Harvard grad Harry Rositzke who worked in the same room with Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Richard Helms, who later became Director of the CIA in 1966. One of Wisner's team was George Bookbinder, who later became President of the Rand Development Corporation. It was the Gehlen organization that dug the famous Berlin tunnel. They, especially the Rand Corporation, became good at digging tunnels (except they have not quite conquered that annoying \"hum\"!). PEOPLE OF EARTH/SHAN The book *Air America* says, during the Vietnam conflict, \"An HQ was established in Singapore where Frank Wisner, the Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA, went personally to head the operation.\" (Robbins, Christopher, *Air America,* New York: Avon Books, 1979, p. 70). Air America was the secret CIA airline involved in Operation Phoenix in the Vietnam war. One of the pilots was John Lear of UFO fame. The name Phoenix was a translation from the Phung Hoang, a mythical bird the Vietnamese said had magical powers to bring news of peace. The CIA bought drugs from Khun Sa, leader of the \"Shan\" people. Bo Gritz, in *Called To Serve,* tells that Khun Sa tried to STOP the drug trade and was forced to continue by the Americans. On page 300, Gritz tells that President Reagan offered to recognize Shanland as a new and independent nation. I suppose it is \"only coincidence\" that the command ship (\"flying saucer\") of the ships involved with UFO legend Billy Meier was called the \"Phoenix\" and the extraterrestrials involved said that their name for Earth was \"Shan.\" The man in charge of the CIA Vietnam drug operation was Richard Armitage, who later became Assistant Secretary of Defense. Armitage shipped the drugs to Manuel Noriega in Panama, who shipped them to George Bush, head of the CIA and later President, at Bush's drug bases in Mena, Arkansas, Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, and through the Zapata and Black Rose and such Bush family operations.

Armitage had a best friend named Erich von Marbod, also a Gehlen Organization person and a friend of Bo Gritz. At the end of the war in Vietnam, \"he [Armitage] and Erich secreted tons of munitions in strategic caches around Southeast Asia. Erich's friends read like a global Who's Who. He was a best friend to the Shah of Iran. He is also very close to James Schlesinger, who was appointed Director of the CIA by Richard Nixon in December 1972. Schlesinger later became Secretary of Defense from 1973-1975 and Secretary of the Department of Energy from 1977-1979\" (Gritz, p. 300). Erich \"...was a protege of Henry Kissinger.\" NIXON, BUSH & DONOVAN On page 572 of his book, Gritz says: \"The Indonesian campaign marked the entry of the CIA into large-scale operations, and although it was a failure, the more the Agency failed in the future, the more it grew and prospered. Oddly enough, the man who had helped back Dulles and Frank Wisner [remember, Wisner was over Gehlen's Nazi spy network] on the campaign was Richard Nixon.\" In 1969, Richard Nixon was in California campaigning and one of his campaign supporters was Reinhard Gehlen, former Nazi head of the German Secret Service (Abwehr). Gehlen was with a high-tech firm called TCI (Transinternational Computer Investment Corp.) that worked on classified Defense Department projects. His translator for German projects was Helene von Damme, who was also Governor Ronald Reagan's personal appointments secretary and personal secretary to Reagan when he became President. Von Damme later became U.S. Ambassador to Austria. Von Damme was former secretary to the Nazi German High Command. William Donovan, head of OSS, and Allen Dulles, head of OSS in Europe under Donovan (who later became head of the CIA until President Kennedy fired him - it was said that he told Kennedy, \"You can't fire me, you don't even know who I work for!\"), and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, brought Reinhard Gehlen and his Abwehr spy group into the United States. One of the men involved was counter-intelligence officer William P. Clark. Clark married Werner von Braun's niece, Joan von Braun (Brauner). Clark at one time was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Clark moved to San Luis Obispo in California and joined Ronald Reagan. He became President Reagan's National Security Advisor on the National Security Council.

He became President Reagan's National Security Advisor on the National Security Council. A suit was filed in Southern California naming William Clark as being involved in the Kennedy assassination. Researchers Mae Brussell, William Torbitt, District Attorney Garrison, and others say Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Werner von Braun, and Walter Dornberger were involved in the Kennedy assassination. Also involved were Richard Nixon, George Bush and Allen Dulles. Col. Bo Gritz, in *Called To Serve* (p. 534), quotes a memo written by an FBI staff assistant in 1947: \"Nixon intervened on behalf of a Chicago gangster who was about to be called as a witness before a congressional committee... It is my sworn statement that one Jack Rubinstein of Chicago, noted as a potential witness for hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, is performing information functions for the staff of Congressman Richard Nixon, Republican of California. It is requested Rubinstein not be called for open testimony in the aforementioned hearings. That same year Rubinstein moved to Dallas, Texas, and changed his name to JACK RUBY...\" Sam Giancana bragged that Nixon was controlled by the \"Mob,\" see the book *Double Cross* written by his brother. GEHLEN AND THE GERMAN GENERAL STAFF Dick Russell in *The Man Who Knew Too Much* is one of the researchers with many details of the involvement of Nixon, Bush, and Dulles and said, \"Willoughby was in regular correspondence with Allen Dulles - before JFK fired Dulles - and with ex(?) Nazis who ran the CIA's European-based spy network\" (p. 707). Gehlen was responsible for reviving the Nazi German General Staff after the war by placing his agent Adolph Heusinger in charge of the German General Staff. *Der Spiegel* said: \"It is quite true that General Gehlen had engaged the former Chief of Wehrmacht Opertions for a purpose other than his espionage service. The West German spy boss did not at that time think of confining himself to merely collecting and sifting information. Two years before Adenauer offered soldiers to the Allies, General Gehlen was, with General Heusinger, already engaged in assembling a new general staff high command.\" (*Der Spiegel,* Feb. 29, 1956.) The Heusinger Wehrmacht were involved in the space race (remember, it was the Germans who started rockets, \"flying saucers,\" etc.). The book *Heusinger of the Fourth Reich* by Charles R. Allen, Jr., said: \"The conservative columnist Edgar Ansel Mower on September 28, 1962 reported that the West German newspaper *Die Welt* of Hamburg devoted a lengthy series to the vigorous efforts being made", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:145:1725092caa3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9845, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "General Heusinger, already engaged in assembling a new general staff high command.\" (*Der Spiegel,* Feb. 29, 1956.) The Heusinger Wehrmacht were involved in the space race (remember, it was the Germans who started rockets, \"flying saucers,\" etc.). The book *Heusinger of the Fourth Reich* by Charles R. Allen, Jr., said: \"The conservative columnist Edgar Ansel Mower on September 28, 1962 reported that the West German newspaper *Die Welt* of Hamburg devoted a lengthy series to the vigorous efforts being made by the West German Defense Ministry to perfect 'death rays' (LASERS) which, when fired from a space platform, 'WOULD BURN, VAPORIZE, DESTROY ANY KNOWN MATTER AND MATERIAL BY ITS FANTASTIC ENERGY CONCENTRATION OF MILLIONS OF WATTS and, from the DISTANCE OF THE MOON, WOULD TAKE EXACTLY 1.3 SECONDS TO KILL.\" (*Long Island Daily Press,* September 28, 1962). Note they were talking, in 1962, of lasers from a Moon base. WILLIAM CLARK Paperclip Operation member William Clark was one who pressured to pardon Ollie North. Clark has a ranch in California called the \"Eagles Nest.\" There was (is?) a machine gun in Clark's living room which came from a National Guard Armory robbery in Oxnard, California. The rest of the weapons from the robbery were stored at a hideout at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. When \"they\" wanted \"their\" guns back, David Koresh did not want to give them back. Oh, friends, why don't you check up on your leaders?! Why waste your time on soap operas, when the real thing is so much more \"interesting\"?! As another interesting \"coincidence,\" not that our present Jewish Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Shalikashvili (who succeeded the part-Jewish, part black CFR member Gen. Colin Powell) speaks English with a foreign accent and was born in Soviet Georgia. The media has reported that his father was a major in the Nazi Waffen SS. In spite of this, he is the darling of the Zionists, with strong support from Les Aspin, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Senator Carl Levin, etc. When Reagan became Governor of California, he appointed William Clark as Superior Court Judge in San Luis Obispo County. Later Reagan appointed him Deputy Secretary of State. When James Watt resigned as Secretary of the Interior, William Clark replaced him. Reagan appointed Clark's wife Joan Brauner (von Braun) Clark as alternate United States representative to the United Nations General Assembly. Ray Renick says: \"The American headquarters of the Gehlen Organization is in San Luis Obispo County.

[The cattle are brought in from Mexico. Cattle have four stomachs.] Ronald Reagan is a slient partner in the San Luis Obispo cattle/drug business. Remember, Clark was one of the original architects of \"Project Paperclip\"! The Zapata Cattle Company is affiliated with George Bush's Zapata Oil Company of Houston, Texas (REF: \"The SLO Connection,\" Barrons article \"The Mexican Connection\") - Sept. 19, 1988. A major law firm for the Gehlen Organization is Sinsheimer, Schiebelhut, and Baggett. The Gehlen Organization, copying Hitler's New Order, established a concentration camp system in San Luis Obispo County. It was called the California Specialized Training Institute. It developed plans called the *King Alfred Plan, Operation Cable Splitter, Operation Garden Plot,* and *REX-84* and was later renamed as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). You can get more information on these subjects from Militia of Montana, Bo Gritz, *Spotlight Newspaper,* etc. Also brought in under *Paperclip* was Henry Kissinger. The U.S. Army 44th CIC and 970th CIC Detachments negotiated the surrender of the German Army in Northern Italy and Austria in Operation Sunrise from which Paperclip took over. Later the Vatican provided documents and help for many Nazis to escape to South America, including Martin Bormann. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands created a group that became known as the Bilderbergers. Many \"conservative\" researchers have come to recognize the Bilderbergers as an important force for the \"New World Order.\" What they probably don't know, though, is that Bernhard was a former Nazi SS storm trooper. Some of the *Paperclip* surrender operation personnel included Theodore Shackley and Heide Kingsbury (daughter of General Galland, designer of the Messerschmidt ME 262). Kingbury became secretary and court transcriber to Judge William Clark. Shackley became head of Operation *Phoenix* in Vietnam (Laos). Shackley was head of JM Wave, code name of the CIA Miami office during the Bay of Pigs and Kennedy assassination events (Furiati, p. 41).

PART 24: GERMAN SCIENTISTS AND ALIENS Here is something you should think seriously about. The ONE thing that \"everybody\" agrees on. Christians, atheists, Republicans, Democrats, Communists, whatever, is that the Nazis were degenerate, sick, nuts, weird, the ultimate evil. I ask you: realistically, how can this be? Is it possible that this is another \"lie?\" You ask, am I saying the Nazis were not evil? What is your definition of evil? Does the evidence support what you believe? How can a whole nation of Germans - many of them our brothers and sisters and direct ancestors - all be totally evil? Were they that different from us? Was our government telling us the truth? Has the government ever told us the truth about ANYTHING? Let's go back to Werner von Braun. IN 1959, (in *News Europa,* Jan. 1, 1959), von Braun states this about extraterrestrials in an interview: \"We find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto assumed, and whose base of operations is at present unknown to us\" (when asked about the deflection of a U.S. satellite). \"More I cannot say at present. We are now engaged in entering into a closer contact with those powers, and in six or nine months' time it may be possible to speak with more precision on the matter.\" The great German space pioneer Hermann Oberth said, \"We cannot take credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fields alone; we have been helped.\" When asked who helped, he said: \"The people of other worlds.\" (Robin Collyns, *Did Spacemen Colonize the Earth?* London: Pelham Books, 1974, p. 236.) Noted German rocket expert Dr. Walter Riedel said: \"I'm convinced that saucers have an out-of-world basis.\" (April, 1952, *LIFE* magazine, p. 96.) The *American Weekly* of October 24, 1954, quoted Professor Oberth of Germany: \"It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system.\" General Douglas MacArthur, quoted in the *The New York Times,* Oct. 8, 1955, said \"The nations of the world will have to unite - for the next", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:148:a02f70286dfb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9848, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "Noted German rocket expert Dr. Walter Riedel said: \"I'm convinced that saucers have an out-of-world basis.\" (April, 1952, *LIFE* magazine, p. 96.)

The nations of the Earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets.\" There is plenty of proof that \"flying saucers\" are real. The questions now are, what are they, and from where do they come? NICAP The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) was founded in 1956 by Navy physicist Thomas Townsend Brown. Brown is known as the discoverer of the electrogravitic capacitance effect. He was former Vice President of Douglas Aircraft (one of the founding groups of the RAND Corporation). NICAP gained a reputation as being a CIA front operation. For many years it was headed by Marine Major Donald Keyhoe. In *Der Weltraum Rueckt Uns Nagher, Blanvalet Verlag,* Chapter III, by; Major Keyhoe, he says that the U.S. infiltrated 600 scientists into Bohemia in tank crew uniforms, in 1945, to check out some of the U.F.O. bases. Vice-Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, a former director of the CIA, was a board member of NICAP for years. Colonel Joseph Bryan III, chief of the CIA psychological warfare staff and Count Nicolas de Rochefort of the same CIA staff were board members. Karl Pflock was chairman of NICAP's Washington sub-committee. John Acuff \"who was alleged to have CIA affiliations\" per the *UFO Encyclopedia* by John Spencer, took over as head of NICAP. Then Acuff did a curious thing, according to *Cosmic Patriot Files, Vol. 2,* by the \"Committed of 12 to Save the Earth,\"* edited by Commander X, p. 137, Acuff sold classified CIA documents to a Nazi organization in Canada called Samisdat. Samisdat is the publisher of two books called *UFOs, Nazi Secret Weapon?* by Mattern-Friedrich and *Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions* by Christof Friedrich, both of which were available from Samisdat Publishers, 206 Carlton St., Toronto, ONT., M5A 2L1, Canada, or from Liberty Bell Publications, Reedy, WV, 25270. A video called *UFO Secrets of WW II German Flying Saucers* and one called *UFO Secrets of the Third Reich,* both produced by the American Academy of Dissident Scientists, are available and a phone number from the tapes is: 310-473-9717. (American Academy of Dissident Scientists, 10970 Ashton Ave. #310, Los Angeles, CA 90024. One of their Presidents is Vladimir Terziski.

Acuff was kicked out and replaced by CIA agent Alan Hall in 1979. Christof Friedrich campaigned to become Prime Minister of Canada. A Jewish radio announcer interviewed Friedrich to try to discredit him, but the result was the firing, blacklisting, and subsequent persecution of the Jewish moderator. *Cosmic Patriot Files* (currently available from ads in UFO publications and most UFO book dealers) says in *Vol. 2*, p. 131 that in 1945 the Germans began transferring their flying saucer projects to a secret underground base near the South Pole. Also in 1945, General Hans Kammler disappeared from Germany and went to the South Pole on German U-Boat U-977, and German flying saucers began appearing over the United States. Samisdat was selling a manuscript called \"The Lightning & the Sun\" by Savitri Devi, a \"guru\" from India whose book connected roots of Naziism with the pyramid in Egypt and Pharoah Akhn-aton and the \"ancient cult of the Sun.\" Willard McIntyre, a friend of Stuart Nixon, who was the assistant to NICAP President John (Jack) Acuff, accused Acuff of selling the material to Samisdat and of intending to merge Samisdat and NICAP. One NICAP board member, the Jewish Senator Barry Goldwater, was quite upset upon learning about the involvement with Samisdat, considered a Nazi organization. Goldwater was busy running for President and no doubt would not appreciate the link to Nazis and UFOs. The head of his Presidential Campaign Committee was someone you have perhaps heard of, named Ronald Reagan. Goldwater was Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. He tried to obtain entrance to the infamous Hangar 18 at Wright-Patterson and was denied. There was more going on with this situation than we are allowed to know. Anyway, Acuff had to go and was forced out. A new board was voted in which included two new board members: one was Senator Goldwater's aide, Charles Lombard, and the other was John Fisher. If you recall, in the early *Fire From The Sky* writings, I said that General George Keegan, head of Air Force Intelligence, inspired the founding of the American Security Council to try to warn the American public of what was happening. The President of the American Security Council was - did you guess it? - John Fisher. A Co-Chairman of the Council was Senator Robert Dole. The members of this council did not understand who was the real enemy, and they were sabotaged. \"NICAP continued to have confidential UFO data leaked to it during Acuff's tenure.

Late in 1976, for example, an officer in the Pentagon provided Acuff with copies of a number of classified documents, including the now-famous Iranian report and several other 'hot' reports.\" This had to be stopped, so Acuff was canned and retired CIA agent Alan Hall was brought in to replace him. \"Not much is known about Hall's background, except he evidently worked in some technical capacity - perhaps with the Office of Scientific Intelligence...\" My-Oh-My. What tangled webs. THEN CAME 1947 The famous Roswell crash occurred in 1947. That year, Operation Majestic-12 was supposedly established by Truman to control the UFO situation, the National Security Act was passed, Project SIGN was established at Wright-Patterson and the CIA was established. Admiral James Forrestal was soon appointed Secretary of Defense, later to be murdered when he was tossed out of a hospital window by CIA agents, because he wanted to tell about the flying saucers. The Roswell, New Mexico, crash of a flying saucer in 1947 has been described by the government as nothing but a weather balloon. Yet, an investigation by the Government Accounting Office and others has shown that all records pertaining to this event were illegally destroyed. Another strange thing about this event is that the government must have released HUNDREDS of these \"weather balloons\" in 1947 - or - perhaps they were not weather balloons? A file in the MUFON computer bulletin board called *1947.SIT* lists the reported sightings of UFOs during 1947, sorted by state. There were 853 events and 3283 witnesses *reported.* How many more were not reported? Quite a lot of \"weather balloons,\" don't you think? In 1951, Congress was talking about turning Antarctica into a nuclear test area, but suddenly changed their mind when Washington was buzzed by UFOs and pictures of flying saucers over the White House appeared on the front pages of newspapers. ANTARCTICA In early 1980, I received the following letter from Christof Friedrich of Samisdat, written in 1979, the same year John Acuff was kicked out of NICAP for selling classified CIA documents to Samisdat. As it is too long, I will quote only part of it. \"SEARCH FOR HITLER'S ANTARCTIC U.F.O. BASES.

Not only is this response extensive, it is massive - a clear indication on the part of knowledgeable UFO researchers and members of the public that they are tired of the 'junk food' being served up by old-line UFO groups and publications who expound the official CIA-KGB alibi that all UFOs are extraterrestrial. What the UFO-watching world wants now is the real meat of the matter - a serious investigation of UFOs whose origins are terrestrial. SAMISDAT is the only organization making such an effort, but we are not alone, for we have thousands of supporters like yourself who want to know the truth which the saucer-charlatans have for 30 years tried to cover up with fairy tale fantasies of 'little green men.' It is people like yourself who have made SAMISDAT the most active UFO organization and publisher on Planet Earth! [I want to insert a question to readers who consider themselves serious UFO researchers. Have you ever heard of Samisdat? That's what I thought. Continuing:] \"Certainly we can be proud of this achievement which is the result, not only of our own Herculean efforts and sacrifices, but of your faithful support during this 5-year-long struggle against the forces of vested interest, deceit and prejudice which have attempted to hide the UFO story under a cloak of childish nonsense and outright lies. For many years we have determinedly pursued this new course of investigation, firm in the knowledge that man is able to achieve that which he perceives. Our researchers' keen sense of direction and perception has guided them unerringly in their discovery of seemingly insignificant clues and the derivation of meaningful patterns therefore. Only such devoted and painstaking research could succeed in unEarthing the present array of facts which indicate the Earthly origin of most flying saucers.

Already, these teams have designed and constructed small scale models, some using conventional power and others which have propulsion systems unprecedented in today's aerospace technology. With additional research, we hope to make available several different models in kit form for hobby-builders.\" END OF QUOTE. ADMIRAL BYRD AND OPERATION HIGHJUMP Also in 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 military troops from the U.S., Britain and Australia in an invasion of Antarctica (Operation Highjump and follow-up), but encountered heavy resistance from Nazi flying saucers and had to call off the invasion. A Rear-Admiral who was in that invasion has retired in Texas, and said he was shocked when he read the *Fire From The Sky* material. He knew there were a lot of aircraft and rocket shoot-downs but did not realize the situation was so bad. The invasion of ANTARCTICA consisted of three battle groups from Norfolk, VA, on Dec. 2, 1946. They were led by Byrd's command ship, the ice-breaker *Northwind,* and consisted of the catapult ship *Pine Island,* the destroyer *Brownsen,* the aircraft-carrier *Phillipines Sea,* the U.S. submarine *Sennet,* two support vessels *Yankee* and *Merrick,* and two tankers *Canisted* and *Capacan,* the destroyer *Henderson* and a floatplane ship *Currituck.* A British-Norwegian force and a Russian force, and I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:153:702a5681898c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9853, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 154, "text": "realize the situation was so bad.

On March 5, 1947 the *El Mercurio* newspaper of Santiago, Chile, had a headline article \"On Board the Mount Olympus on the High Seas\" which quoted Byrd in an interview with Lee van Atta: \"Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States to initiate immediate defence measures against hostile regions. The admiral further stated that he didn't want to frighten anyone unduly but that it was a bitter reality that in case of a new war the continental United States would be attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds. (Earlier he had recommended defence bases at the North Pole.) Admiral Byrd repeated the above points of view, resulting from his personal knowledge gathered both at the north and south poles, before a news conference held for International News Service.\" When Byrd returned to the States, he was hospitalized and was not allowed to hold any more press conferences. In March 1955, he was placed in charge of Operation Deepfreeze which was part of the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) exploration of the Antarctic. He died, some have suggested he was murdered, in 1957. UFO researchers are familiar with a diary purported to be Admiral Byrd's diary which tells of an entrance to a hollow Earth at the poles and a being called THE MASTER. The diary is generally considered to be a hoax, but even if it is a hoax, it is an indication that there was SOMETHING going on upon which to build the hoax. UFO researchers are also aware of strange sightings of flying saucers with swastikas or iron crosses on them, \"aliens\" speaking German, etc. An example is the American Reinhold Schmidt, whose father was born in Germany, who tells in his book *Incident At Kearney* (Nebraska) that he was taken on a flying saucer on several occasions. He said the crew spoke German and acted like German soldiers. He said they took him to the Polar region (if someone were making up a story, why would they claim to be taken, of all places, to the pole?) After returning he was subjected to persecution by the U.S. Government. His description of the flying saucers matched pictures captured from the Germans. In 1959, three large newspapers in Chile reported front page articles about UFO encounters where the crew", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:154:1c7f98aaedac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9854, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 155, "text": "He said the crew spoke German and acted like German soldiers.

In 1959, three large newspapers in Chile reported front page articles about UFO encounters where the crew members appeared to be German soldiers. IN the 1960s there were reports in New York and New Jersey of flying saucer \"aliens\" who spoke German, or English with a German accent. In the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg atomic espionage trials, they spoke of \"warships of space.\" Since they had access to top secret information, about what were they talking? END OF PART 24. PART 25: HITLER ESCAPED! I remember hearing, in the 1950s, rumors that Hitler had escaped to a secret Nazi base at the South Pole. In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower said: \"We have been unable to unearth one bit of tangible evidence of Hitler's death. Many people believe that Hitler escaped from Berlin.\" When President Truman asked Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam conference in 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, \"No.\" Stalin's top army officer, Marshall Gregory Zhukov, whose troops were the ones to occupy Berlin, flatly stated after a long thorough investigation in 1945: \"We have found no corpse that could be Hitler's.\" The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremburg, Thomas J. Dodd, said: \"No one can say he is dead.\" Major General Floyd Parks, who was commanding general of the U.S. sector in Berlin, stated for publication that he had been present when Marshall Zhukov described his entrance to Berlin, and Zhukov stated he believed Hitler might have escaped. Lt. Gen. Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff to Gen. Eisenhower in the European invasion and later Director of the CIA, stated publicly on Oct. 12, 1945, \"No human being can say conclusively that Hitler is dead.\" Col. W.J. Heimlich, former Chief, United States Intelligence, at Berlin, stated for publication that he was in charge of determining what had happened to Hitler and after a thorough investigation his report was: \"There was no evidence beyond that of hearsay to support the theory of Hitler's suicide.\" He also stated, \"On the basis of present evidence, no insurance company in America would pay a claim on Adolph Hitler.\" Nuremburg judge Michael Mussmanno said in his book *Ten Days to Die,* \"Russia must accept much of the blame (to the extent that it still exists) that Hitler did not die in May 1945.\" However, Mussmanno stated that he interviewed Hitler's personal waiter, his valet, his chauffeur, his two secretaries, pilots, top generals, etc., and they all agreed perfectly that Hitler committed suicide. He said they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:155:5dc1b191c8f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9855, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 156, "text": "present evidence, no insurance company in America would pay a claim on Adolph Hitler.\" Nuremburg judge Michael Mussmanno said in his book *Ten Days to Die,* \"Russia must accept much of the blame (to the extent that it still exists) that Hitler did not die in May 1945.\" However, Mussmanno stated that he interviewed Hitler's personal waiter, his valet, his chauffeur, his two secretaries, pilots, top generals, etc., and they all agreed perfectly that Hitler committed suicide. He said they could not have gotten together afterward and made up a story that agreed in perfect detail without one flaw anywhere, so they must be telling the truth and he was absolutely convinced that Hitler committed suicide. The story at first sounds convincing, until you realized that they could have memorized a story BEFOREHAND and these were all people who almost WORSHIPPED Hitler. Do witnesses ever agree *perfectly* in detail in real life? Former Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes in his book *Frankly Speaking* (as quoted in the April 1948 *The Cross and The Flag*): \"While in Potsdam at the Conference of the Big Four, Stalin left his chair, came over and clinked his liquor glass with mine in a very friendly manner. I said to him: 'Marshal Stalin, what is your theory about the death of Hitler?' Stalin replied: \"He is not dead. He escaped either to Spain or Argentina.'\" I still have the September, 1948, issue of a magazine called *The Plain Truth* with the headline article: \"IS HITLER ALIVE, OR DEAD?,\" subtitled: \"Here is summarized the conclusions of an exhaustive three-year investigation - together with reasons for believing Hitler may be alive and secretly planning the biggest hoax of all history.\" Another article in November, 1949, says \"The Nazis went underground, May 16, 1943!\" and details a meeting at the residence of Krupp von Bohlen-Halbach, the head of I.G. Farben, etc., at which they planned \"for World War III.\" Another article in August, 1952, entitled \"HITLER DID NOT DIE,\" subtitled \"Adolph Hitler's fake suicide in his Berlin Bunker now is exposed as History's greatest hoax! Positive evidence comes to light that Hitler did not die - here's new evidence that Hitler is alive, directing Nazi underground, today!\" The June, 1952, issue of *The Plain Truth* is headlined: \"HITLER *May Be Alive!\"* The article states: \"Now, NEW FACTS, or purported facts, leak out. It's reported now that in 1940 the Nazis started to amass tractors, planes, sledges, gliders, and all sorts of machinery and materials IN THE SOUTH POLAR REGIONS - that for the next 4 years Nazi technicians built, on an almost unknown CONTINENT, Antarctica, the Fuhrer's SHANGRILA - a new Berchtesgaden.

The report says they scooped out an entire mountain, built a new refuge completely camouflaged - a magic mountain hide-a-way. The recently discovered continent is larger than Europe - 5,600 miles from Africa, 1,900 miles from the southern tip of South America, 4,800 miles from Australia. It is NOT a mere ice-covered surface, but a real continent, with plains, valleys, mountain peaks up to 15,000 feet. The temperature in the interior is around zero (?) in the summer, and never drops below 20 or 30 degrees below in the winter. In other words, it is not as cold as in parts of North Dakota or Canada.\" *Bonjour* magazine, the *Police Gazette,* and the Paris newspaper *Le Monde* all had articles about Hitler's South Pole hideaway. Admiral Doenitz, in 1943, stated, \"The German submarine fleet has even now established an earthly paradise, an impregnable fortress, for the Fuhrer, in whatever part of the world.\" Although he did not specify where the exact location was, *Bonjour* pointed out that in 1940 Nazi engineers had begun construction of buildings that were to withstand temperatures to 60 degrees below zero. There have been strong rumors, from the end of the War, that Hitler escaped to the South Pole. Yet, most people simply REFUSE to believe the evidence, the idea that Hitler survived the war is just unacceptable! It is too upsetting to too many people! There is plenty of PROOF that the Americans and Russians LIED about what happened to Hitler, and there are strong rumors that he escaped to Antarctica. There is ample proof that a major group of Nazis escaped to Argentina. What do YOU think? Why did Admiral Byrd lead an *invasion to Antarctica,* and why the extreme secrecy about the whole situation? In 1981, Donald McKale wrote *Hitler: The Survival Myth* to try to lay to rest the questions about what happened to Hitler. The flyleaf says: \"In this book a distinguished historian examines the postwar world's most absorbing and persistent mystery, revealing why it has endured and where the mystery leads\" (emphasis mine). The back flyleaf says \"Absolute certainty about what happened still eludes us today.\" Just recently on TV there are STILL programs telling \"at last, the final, once and for all, this is the real story\" about what happened to Hitler, yet they all do not really answer the question.

A recent TV program, called \"What Really Happened to Adolph Hitler,\" after investigating numerous stories, ends by saying that, in spite of Glasnost and the new freedom of access to Russian files, the files on Hitler are still some of the most highly classified items of the Soviets. The *Diario Illustrado* of Santiago, Chile, January 18, 1948 issue, said: \"On 30th of April, 1945, Berlin was in dissolution but little of that dissolution was evident at Templehof Airfield. At 4:15 p.m. at JU52 landed and S.S. troops directly from Rechlin for the defence of Berlin disembarked, all of them young, not older than 18 years. The gunner in the particular plane was an engineer by the name of B... whom I had known for a number of years and for whom I had endeavored to get exemption from military service. He sought to tank up and leave Berlin as quickly as possible. During this re-fueling interval Mr. B... was suddenly elbowed in the ribs by his radio operator with a nod to look in a certain direction. At about 100-120 meters he saw a sleek Messerschmitt Jet Model 332 [an editorial comment says this should be an ARADO 234]. Br. B.. and the radio operator saw, and without any doubt whatsoever, standing in front of the jet, their Commander in Chief, Adolf Hitler, dressed in field-grey uniform and gesticulating animatedly with some Party functionaries, who were obviously seeing him off. For about ten minutes whilst their plane was being refuelled the two men observed this scene and around 4:30 p.m. they took to the air again. They were extremely astonished to hear during the midnight military news bulletin, some seven and a half hours later, that Hitler had committed suicide.\" On a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program called *As It Happens,* September 17th, 1974 at 7:15 p.m., a Prof. Dr. Ryder Saguenay, oral surgeon from the Dental Faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles, said that Hitler had ordered a special plane to leave from Berlin with all medical and dental records, especially X-rays, of all top Nazis for an unknown destination. He said that the dental records used to identify Hitler's body were drawn from MEMORY by a dental assistant, who disappeared and was never found. An editorial in *Zig Zag,* Santiago, Chile, January 16, 1948, states that on April 30th, 1945, Flight Captain Peter Baumgart took Adolf Hitler, his wife Eva Braun, as well as a few loyal friends by plane from Tempelhof Airport to Tondern in Denmark (still German controlled). From Tondern, they took another plane to Kristiansund in Norway (also German controlled).

From Tondern, they took another plane to Kristiansund in Norway (also German controlled). From there they joined a submarine convoy. (*U.F.O. Letzte Geheimwaffe des III Reiches,* Mattern, pp. 50-51.) The Jewish writer Michael Bar-Zohar in *The Avengers,* p. 99, said: \"In 1943 Admiral Doenitz had declared: 'The German U-boat fleet is proud to have made an earthly paradise, an impregnable fortress for the Fuhrer, somewhere in the world.' He did not say in what part of the world it existed, but fairly obviously it was in South America.\" The German writer Mattern said that Admiral Doenitz told a graduating class of naval cadets in Kiel in 1944: \"The German Navy has still a great role to play in the future. The German Navy knows all hiding places for the Navy to take the Fuhrer to, should the need arise. There he can prepare his last measures in complete quiet.\" The Germans say they were in contact with extraterrestrials. Now consider what Ronald Reagan, who was involved with the formerly Nazi Gehlen spy organization, said to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the November 1985 Geneva summit conference: He told him, \"How much easier your task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this earth together.\" (*International Herald Tribune and Daily Telegraph,* 5 Dec. 1985.) On September 21, 1987, Reagan spoke before the General Assembly of the United Nations and said: \"I occasionally think, how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet I ask, is not an alien force already among us?\" On May 4, 1988, at Chicago's Palmer House Hotel, Reagan said: \"I've often wondered, what if all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by an outer... a power from outer space, from another planet.\" You of course have heard about Reagan's Star Wars program. If you study what was reported *after* the Gulf War about the Patriot missiles, you will find that the Patriot missile program and the Star Wars program were a big lie and the money was spent on something other than what we were told.

The Patriot missiles never shot down a Scud, as learned by Congressional inquiry and reported by Israel. There are so many facets to this story, it is hard to explain one part because it will not make sense unless you understand the other parts. END OF PART 25. PART 26: POLAR DEFENSES One thing that Admiral Byrd stated in a press conference after his defeat at Antarctica was that the Antarctic continent should be surrounded by a \"wall of defence installations since it represented the last line of defence for America.\" Although the U.S. and Russia had been allies during the war, suddenly the \"Iron Curtain\" was created and we and the Russians became enemies. Both the Soviets and the United States ringed the poles with defense and detection bases, and in between was the barren no-man's-land of the poles where absolutely nobody lived, or did they? Could it be that we pretended we were protecting against the Russians and they pretended they were protecting against us, while really we and they were both scared of what was in between us - the Nazi Last Battalion? UFO researchers should now begin to see the light of why the Navy has always been in the lead of UFO research. And you should now understand why, right from the beginning, they issued shoot-to-kill orders against any UFOs and why the situation was so highly classified! And anti-communist researchers have more clues now as to why we were giving aid to the Soviets at the same time we were calling them our enemies! UFOs - NAZIS OR ALIENS? Let me be sure you understand, though, that NOT ALL UFOs ARE NAZIS. Originally they were Nazi with some alien. Later the U.S. developed UFOs, and the Russians, and who knows who else. But all along there really were extraterrestrials, that is from where some of the technology originally came. Read the lives of Walter Russell, Nikola Tesla, the world's most advanced mathematician Ramanujan, etc., and they all say they were in contact with \"gods\" (The Goddess Namagiri, in the case of Ramanujan) or they had \"enlightenment\" from a \"cosmic messenger\" as in the case of Walter Russell. Russell is one who understood true physics, as opposed to the deceptions taught in modern physics. RUSSIAN SPACE PROGRAM Let's return to the origin of the Russian space program.

The Russians also captured many German rocket and space scientists. Later the chief Russian physicist was Kapitsa, who once headed an atomic research laboratory at Cambridge University. (*Assault on the Unknown, The International Geophysical Year* by Walter Sullivan, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, p. 56. Part of the IGY explorations were covers for secret investigations into the Nazi UFO base at Antarctica, see books referenced elsewhere.) The Russians were successful in their endeavors and in 1972, at a meeting of Communist leaders in Prague, Brezhnev stated that the Soviets would be able to dominate the world by 1985. He specifically stated they would control the oceans, 90% of the land, and the air and space. He said they would control, not invade and conquer. In 1974, the construction of the Tara directed-energy facility at Saryshagan was begun. In 1975, a Soviet article in *International Life* talks about weather war, changing the nature of lightning, increasing the power of lightning, and using directed energy of tremendous power at specific targets. It tells of using \"atmospheric electricity\" to suppress mental activity of large groups of people. On June 13, 1975 - he repeated his call for a ban on doomsday weapons to visiting U.S. Senators. They could not understand what he was talking about. In August 1975 - Ponomarev made the same proposal to a group of U.S. congressmen visiting the Kremlin, same result. In November of 1975 - large amounts of hydrogen gas with traces of tritium were detected at Semipalatinsk by U.S. Air Force TRW reconnaissance satellites. General George Keegan had been paying special attention to this facility ever since one of his men warned him of something \"fishy\" there in 1972. This was evidence confirming his suspicions of Soviet particle beam research. In October-December of 1975 - the Soviets destroyed at least five U.S. satellites over the Indian Ocean. In 1976 - the State Department revealed that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had been continuously under some sort of microwave radiation attack from the Soviets. Two ambassadors were killed, other people got sick. All Embassy employees were given a 20% hazardous duty pay increase. In 1976 - Soviet nuclear physicist Rudakov visited the U.S., and gave a talk which was immediately classified and the blackboard ripped down and carried away. Material which was open public scientific material in the USSR was considered classified here in the U.S. Who was being kept in the dark?

March 30, 1976 - a huge unexplained boom occurred over the Netherlands. Probable Soviet scalar howitzer test. July 4, 1976 - Independence Day! Russia joined our celebrations by activating its giant *Woodpecker transmitters* causing worldwide interference in all frequencies from 3 to 30 MHz. Transmissions have been continuous ever since. Later the U.S. government said these were merely Russian over-the-horizon radar. September 10, 1976 - European Airways Flight 831, Moscow to London, saw a huge blinding ball of light below them. Pilot contacted Soviets, was told to not ask questions. This was probably a test to measure the British reaction and to determine if the British knew what it was. In 1976 - Sweden detected evidence of nuclear explosions from Semipalatinsk but without seismic activity. In 1976 - Legionnaires Disease strikes in downtown Philadelphia. Kills 34, 187 others got sick. Dr. P. David Beter said this was actually caused by Soviets releasing plutonium gas, but Bearden says it was a scalar electromagnetic attack. SCALAR WEAPONS ACTIVATED March 24, 1977 - a luminous patch of light appeared off the coast of Spanish Sahara, Africa, and a large globe of dynamic lights appeared over it. Bearden says this was a test of the Tesla shield which shields everything within it from any outside attack. June 11, 1977 - Soviet scientist gave a report to *Los Angeles Times* journalist Robert Toth (who was in Moscow) which spoke of energy coming from the vacuum of space. KGB quickly arrested both and charged them with possessing Soviet state secrets. Most American scientists at the time thought energy from the vacuum was nonsense. September 26, 1977 - Russia launched the Intercosmos 17 octagon space vehicle and destroyed the U.S. moon base, as mentioned in earlier *Fire From The Sky* material. Soviets also destroyed our spy satellites and \"took the high ground.\" Russia has prevented us from controlling space ever since. December 1977 and later - mysterious unexplained booms began occurring off the U.S. coasts. This was, according to Bearden, Soviet weapon registration and calibration, and according to Beter was warnings to our government. Also in 1977 - Russia began weather war in earnest. Two huge hot spots in the Pacific were created which caused an El Nio effect and resulted in one of the most severe winters on record.

January 27, 1978 - all three engines fail on a Boeing 727 off U.S. east coast, restart one by one as plane falls 8,000 feet. Bearden says this was a Soviet test and warning. Four planes crash in 6 days NW of Las Vegas in February, 1978. From this point on the aircraft events and crashes are too numerous to list and are still ongoing. Atmospheric booms were reported over Texas coast, Nova Scotia, South Carolina. April 2, 1978 - 39 pilots in a race off Florida experience \"time loss\" on synchronized watches. Unexplained lights and lighted objects seen and tracked on radar over Florida. For more information on scalar EM bird kills, earthquakes, Tesla shield observations, crashes, and much more as part of Soviet man-caused events, see Tom Bearden's material, Dr. Beter's material, and related material from other authors. There are far too many for me to list. COALITION INSIDER In December, 1978, I received Vol. 1, No. 1 of the *Coalition Insider,* a report of the Coalition for Peace Through Strength. This was published by the American Security Council, started by General George Keegan after he resigned as head of Air Force Intelligence to become a private citizen so he could warn about the Soviet particle beam and other weapons developments. The back page article entitled \"Soviets Have Satellite Killers\" says: \"At a news conference recently, Defense Secretary Harold Brown revealed that the Soviet Union has placed into operation a space interceptor satellite capable of shooting down U.S. military and civilian satellites.\" How did he know the capabilities of these interceptors? Because they had already knocked out our satellites! The article further stated: \"Last year, the Soviet Union denounced the U.S. for even considering the development of a similar space interceptor satellite, capable of shooting down Soviet interceptor satellites, before they could knock out our reconnaissance satellites. Any such plans, warned Moscow, would be in 'direct violation' of the treaty for peaceful uses of space. But, the Soviets already had a 'killer satellite' of their own!\" The co-chairman of the press conference is pictured; his name was Senator Robert Dole. NORTHERN BOOK HOUSE Also in 1978 I received a packet of Communist literature from the Soviet distributor Northern Book House, Box 1000, Gravenhurst, Ontario, Canada. At the time, I considered the material as worthless nonsense garbage. Now, as I review it, I am shocked. They talk about humans and animals responding to \"electromagnetic waves.\" They talk about Soviet scientist Dr. N. A.

They talk about humans and animals responding to \"electromagnetic waves.\" They talk about Soviet scientist Dr. N. A. Kozyrev's study of earthquakes on the moon. They talk about getting energy out of the vacuum. They brag about the \"world's first supersonic aircraft,\" the Soviet TU-104, introduced in 1956 (they ignore the German supersonic bomber code-named Horten XVIII, made in 1945). I'll just quote the article: \"Remember back to 1956? World's first jet passenger plane. Changed whole course of flying (vastly increased people carried). When NN [*Northern Neighbors,* publication of Northern Book House] said it (15 years ago), hor-hor-hor, such exaggerating! Plane was, of course, famous Soviet TU-104, long far ahead of USA. Now they've {Russia] got the TU-144 supersonic aircraft. And where is USA? Where NN said it would be. Far behind USSR's. But darn it all, we missed out! We didn't say USA would not have any SST at all, like it hasn't. Sorry, but don't expect to see us exaggerate all the time. These days it's hard to see how far behind USA is falling.\" Oh, but now we are far ahead of them, we are told. Our supersonic passenger transport is the, ah, er, it's the - somebody help me out here, please? And our space station is the ah, er, oh - never mind. We have Disney World, so there! They quote a *U.S. News & World Report* article \"U.S. Superiority Has Ended,\" April 5, 1971. The centerfold of the magazine is a spread of pictures of the inside of their space station and the four men working there for months at a time. They point out that the U.S. astronauts have to crash land in the ocean on return, while Soviet astronauts land on the ground. The next page is an article condemning Zionism as racism! One of the articles tells of the Russian educational system. In their system, there is no homework, all study is done at school. Everybody learns another language starting in Grade One. In some of the schools physical training consists of three hours a day! No wonder they win all the Olympic medals. Oh well, they are probably just bragging. KAMMLER Anybody familiar with Nazi Germany will be familiar with Himmler, Speer, Bormann and such but few have ever heard of Hans Kammler. Kammler was a General in the SS, rather an accomplishment any way you look at it. Kammler \"was regarded by many in the Nazi hierarchy as the most powerful man in Germany outside the Cabinet.\" (*Blunder! How the U.S. Gave Away", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:164:2d4bd72d0d59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9864, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "day!

KAMMLER Anybody familiar with Nazi Germany will be familiar with Himmler, Speer, Bormann and such but few have ever heard of Hans Kammler. Kammler was a General in the SS, rather an accomplishment any way you look at it. Kammler \"was regarded by many in the Nazi hierarchy as the most powerful man in Germany outside the Cabinet.\" (*Blunder! How the U.S. Gave Away Nazi Supersecrets to Russia,* by Tom Agoston, Dodd, Mead & Co., p. 4.) Kammler, whose position of authority was directly under Himmler, was in charge of Hitler's most secret projects, specifically projects such as the world's first jet engines and rockets. He had over 14 million people working for him, mostly building underground factories. Agoston said his projects were equivalent to being in charge of building the Great Pyramids of the Coliseum in Rome. Speer said that he believed that Kammler was being considered to take his (Speer's) position. Working under Kammler in charge of rockets was General Walther Dornberger, who with Dr. Werner von Braun, developed the V-2 rocket. Working with Kammler at the \"Reich's most advanced high-technology military research center\" at the Skoda armament complex in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia was General Dr. Wilhelm Voss. Some of the projects at Skoda remain secret to this day, but it is acknowledged that among the projects was one by Dr. Franz Josef Neugebauer, \"a specialist in thermal systems for aircraft nuclear propulsion.\" (Agoston, p. 12.) Albert Speer, in his book *Spandau, The Secret Diaries,* brags that it was he who ordered Werner Heisenberg to stop building an atomic bomb and concentrate on a \"uranium motor\" for aircraft. Towards the end of the war, Hitler even made Goering and Speer subordinate to Kammler. Eisenhower admits in *Crusade In Europe* that the Nazis were within 6 months of developing advanced weapons that would have changed the outcome of the war. RUDOLPH HESS AND SECRET GERMAN SPACE BASE Rudolph Hess, Hitler's best friend and second in command, went to England to try to stop the war with Britain and was arrested as a \"war criminal\" on May 10, 1941 and was kept from having any contact with the public until he was recently murdered. He was the only prisoner in Spandau prison. Ones who paid any attention to his situation at all have wondered what was the big secret he knew that made him so dangerous to the Allies? Perhaps the answer is revealed in Friedrich's book *Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions* on page 34: Hess \"was entrusted with the all-important Antarctic file... Hess, himself, kept the Polar File...\" If you look at a map of Antarctica you will see that a portion of Queen Maud Land is called new Schwabenland.

This is the part of the continent nearest to South Africa. The Germans made a major expedition to this area in 1938-1939 and began the construction of a major base. For details of this expedition, see the book by Friedrich. This book has pictures of the *warmwater* ponds and other information that will surprise you. It has maps showing that Admiral Byrd's Operation Highjump (Naval Task Force 68) military invasion landed on the side opposite the German bases. The book tells of a major food item in the area called krill. Ever heard of \"Krill?\" The maps of Operation Highjump say that they left the German side of the continent unexplored. A man who was very influential in modern German post-war politics was Hans-Ulrich Rudel, a frequent guest speaker in German military and political circles. Rudel was the man groomed by Hitler to become his successor. It is known that Rudel made frequent trips to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America nearest Antarctica. One of Martin Bormann's last messages from the bunker in Berlin to Doenitz mentioned Tierra del Fuego. The book, *UFOs, Nazi Secret Weapon?* says (p. 8) \"Hitler's appraisal of the Jews can best be summed up as contained in '*THE PROTOCOLS OF THE LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION.' This is a very important aspect of the whole U.F.O. story, because in it, we find the seeds for many far-reaching decisions made 30 years later.\" Do you have any idea what such a politically \"incorrect\" subject such as the *PROTOCOLS* could have to do with UFOs? A book called *America's Aircraft Year Book* tells about the U.S. using captured German scientists at Ft. Bliss and Wright Field. \"Among those in the German group at Wright Field were Rudolph Hermann, Alexander Lippsisch, Heinz Schmitt, Helmut Heinrich, and Fritz Doblhoff and Ernst Kugel. Hermann was attached to the Peenemunde Research Station for Aerodynamics, where Germany's V-2 rockets were hatched and launched against England. A specialist in supersonics, he was in charge of the supersonic wind tunnel at Kochel in the Bavarian Alps. He also was a member of the group entrusted with Hitler's futuristic plans to establish a space-station rocket-refueling base revolving as a satellite about the Earth at a distance of 4,000 miles - a scheme which he and certain high-ranking AAF officers in 1947 still believed to be feasible.\" Later evidence shows that most or all of the craft and flying saucer scientists disappeared.

The available evidence indicates they went to South America or Antarctica. The *El Mercurio* and *Der Weg* papers told of a large submarine convoy discovered by the British Navy at the end of WW II. All available Allied units engaged the convoy and were totally destroyed except for the Captain of one destroyer, who was reported as saying, \"May God help me, may I never again encounter such a force.\" On July 10, 1945, more than two months after the end of the War, the German submarine U-530 surrendered to Argentine authorities. The Commander was Otto Wermoutt. The sub had a crew of 54 men (the normal sub crew was 18 men) and the cargo consisted of 540 barrels of cigarettes and unusually large stocks of food. The Commander was 25 years old, the second officer was 22, and the crew was an average of 25 except for one man who was 32 years old. This was an unusually young crew and upon questioning it was learned that they all claimed that they had no relatives. A map from a Spanish book called *Is Hitler Alive?* with the route of the Fuhrer convoy shows it passed alongside South Georgia Island, where later a secret underground base was the focus of a secret battle during the Falkland Islands War. On April 4, 1944 at 4:40 a.m. the German submarine U-859 left on a mysterious mission carrying 67 men and 33 tons of mercury sealed in glass bottles in watertight tin crates. The sub was sunk by a British submarine and most of the crew died. One survivor on his death bed about 30 years later told about the expensive cargo and some divers checked out his story and found the mercury. For what purpose was this mercury to be used? And where were they trying to take it? There are many other stories of other U-boats and German survivors, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. The Germans and other European nations required very meticulous registration records of everybody, including their relatives, employment, addresses, children, etc., and at the end of the war the Allies, cross checking these records, taking into account casualties and deaths, determined that there were 250,000 persons unaccounted for. WERNER HEISENBERG Hitler signed the order for the atomic bomb to be built on September 26, 1939. The top scientist on this project was Dr. Werner Heisenberg.

WERNER HEISENBERG Hitler signed the order for the atomic bomb to be built on September 26, 1939. The top scientist on this project was Dr. Werner Heisenberg. (Powers, Thomas, *Heisenberg's War,* Alfred A. Knopf, 1993, p. 16.) Heisenberg won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1932 \"for the creation of quantum mechanics.\" He was professor of theoretical physics at Leipzig and later Director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics. His best friend, until the war, was Niels Bohr. Edward Teller received his doctorate by studying under Heisenberg (Powers, vii). Thomas Powers wrote the book *Heisenberg's War, The Secret of the German Bomb,* in which one of the main themes was trying to account for the fact that Germany was far ahead of the rest of the world in developing the bomb and yet the Allies were astonished when they found the primitive experimental reactor at the end of the war that was supposedly the best the Germans were able to accomplish. Excuses such as German inefficiency, etc., do not fit the evidence, and to say that the Germans were more moral than the American Jews that developed the bomb is not politically acceptable. It is known that the Germans were also working on the hydrogen bomb, and the Allies frantically bombed the heavy water plants. There are many books and movies about the heroes who stopped the German nuclear efforts, yet somewhere in the hoopla you find that at least one large load of heavy water was never accounted for. In a speech in June 1949, Vannevar Bush tells that the Allies were extremely concerned that the Germans were ahead of them on the bomb, but finally found out \"they had not accomplished five percent of the undertaking which had been brought to success... in this country.\" He blamed their failure on typical German \"regimentation in a totalitarian system.\" But if you think about it with an open mind, you should realize that \"regimentation in a totalitarian system\" is usually MORE efficient, especially when it comes to making weapons. Powers explores Heisenberg's explanation that the Germans \"had used their influence as experts to direct the work into the channels which have been mapped in the foregoing report.\" But the \"foregoing report\" did not explain what happened. Powers said: \"His account is incomplete. Something is withheld\" (p. 482).

It is the difficulty of assigning reasons for the failure that have kept the issue tender for nearly fifty years.\" When Field Marshall Erhard Milch visited the Gottow laboratories in 1945 where atomic research was being carried out, he asked Heisenberg, \"How big would a bomb have to be in order to destroy New York or London?\" Heisenberg replied: \"About as big as a pineapple, and we will have a basketful for the Fuhrer by Christmas...!\" (Mattern-Friedrich, *UFOs, Nazi Secret Weapon?,* p. 77. Some of the material in the book came from classified documents obtained from the CIA. See elsewhere in this text.) (It takes 33 pounds of highly-enriched uranium or 13 pounds of plutonium to make a small atomic bomb). In 1943 Niels Bohr escaped from Denmark to London and reported that Germany was making the bomb. They also had proof that the Germans had \"cornered the major supplies of uranium and also of thorium.\" END OF PART 26. PART 27: WHO CREATED THE ATOMIC BOMB? Boris Pash, head of security for the Manhattan Project, and scientist Samuel Goudsmit followed the lead tanks into Paris and into Germany, looking for the German nuclear laboratory, which they found in Strasbourg. This was called Operation Alsos (Greek for \"Groves\"). Peter Goodchild in his book *J. Robert Oppenheimer, Shatterer of Worlds,* p. 110 said: \"Very soon a picture of the Germans' progress began to emerge. They revealed that Hitler had been told of the possibilities of a nuclear weapon in 1942 and that there had been a whole series of uranium pile experiments. But the crucial facts were that even as late as August 1944 the experiments were still at an early stage. The Germans had neither the certain information that an explosive chain reaction was possible, nor did they have the material or the mechanism to make their bomb. It was apparent that the project had moved forward hardly at all since 1942. There were one or two people in Washington who, when they read Goudsmit's final report, suspected that the information had come too easily, but most people believed it.\" It is possible that Germany DID develop the bomb, and the Allies kept it secret? In *Heisenberg's War,* p. 481, Vannevar Bush is quoted as saying in June 1949: \"The Nazis wanted an atomic bomb; we knew that. They had as good a chance at it as we had. In the tense years up to 1945 we thought that they were close competitors, even", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:169:9f10e749e4c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9869, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 170, "text": "Goudsmit's final report, suspected that the information had come too easily, but most people believed it.\" It is possible that Germany DID develop the bomb, and the Allies kept it secret? In *Heisenberg's War,* p. 481, Vannevar Bush is quoted as saying in June 1949: \"The Nazis wanted an atomic bomb; we knew that. They had as good a chance at it as we had. In the tense years up to 1945 we thought that they were close competitors, even that they might be six months ahead of us. Then after Stuttgart fell and the Alsos mission did its work, we found out. The Nazis had not even reached first base.\" Surprise, surprise. Or was it lie, lie? My best guess, based on the evidence, is that there is a strong possibility Germany DID develop the atomic bomb! The Americans managed to capture some of them in early 1945, then on August 6, 1945, dropped one on Hiroshima. This would account for J. Robert Oppenheimer's curious statement that the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was made in Germany. Could the Germans have taken some bombs with them when Hitler escaped? Was the submarine convoy protected by nuclear weapons, and were they what stopped Operation Highjump? Perhaps not, that is just conjecture, but I strongly suspect we got the \"bomb\" from the Germans. In *Blowback,* \"the first full account of America's recruitment of Nazis, and its disastrous effect on our domestic and foreign policy\" by Christopher Simpson, he states: \"On July 6 [1945] the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) specifically authorized an effort to 'exploit... chosen, rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use' under the top secret project code-named Overcast... At first this was justified on the grounds that German scientists might be useful in the continuing war against Japan\" (p.33). When the Allies found the German atomic bomb laboratory, they were amazed that it was just a small concrete reactor in a cave, too small to go critical. Yet they went to considerable trouble in a top secret program to grab these scientists because they might be useful in defeating Japan? What were they going to do, throw radioactive concrete at the Japanese? Tom Agoston in *Blunder!* says (p. 38) that \"Unknown to Allied scientists, the Germans had been able to build up a sizeable stockpile of U-235 and had held up to two tons, as well as two tons of heavy water.\" William Stevenson, in *A Man Called Intrepid,* says \"The Germans had the man [Heisenberg] whose theoretical work was the basis of the bomb\" (p. 456) and \"In the military field, the view prevailed in 1939 that the country with the greatest chance of brining together the pieces was Germany.\" Let's see now, the atomic bomb was a German idea, they had the best scientists, they had a proven ability to develop advanced weapons, they had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:170:25f84a02fbc3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9870, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "two tons of heavy water.\" William Stevenson, in *A Man Called Intrepid,* says \"The Germans had the man [Heisenberg] whose theoretical work was the basis of the bomb\" (p. 456) and \"In the military field, the view prevailed in 1939 that the country with the greatest chance of brining together the pieces was Germany.\" Let's see now, the atomic bomb was a German idea, they had the best scientists, they had a proven ability to develop advanced weapons, they had plenty of raw material, and yet their \"bomb\" consisted of nothing more than some radioactive concrete in a cave in a hill at the base of a church? (*Heisenberg's War,* p. 421.) The German laboratory was captured on April 21, 1945, then three months later on July 16 a bomb was tested at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Then on August 6, 1945, one was dropped on Hiroshima, and August 9 on Nagasaki. This is not counting the nuclear explosion in the Oakland, California, area, but we are not supposed to know about that. Pash and Goudsmit in Operation Alsos captured several tons of uranium and \"it was shipped to Britain and then the United States, transformed into uranium hexaflouride gas for isotope separation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and finally in the form of U-235 used to destroy Hiroshima.\" (*Heisenberg's War,* p. 362.) Most classified files from World War II have been routinely declassified under the provisions of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Tom Agoston (*Blunder!,* p. 124) said of the Alsos information, \"The files continued to be suppressed and remain under lock and key in Washington, well beyond the thirty-year rule. The motive for this remains a four-decade mystery.\" He also said that the testimony of Albert Speer, referring to General Kammler, \"The transcript continues to be classified beyond the normal thirty-year rule, and is not expected to be made public before 2020.\" Kammler disappeared at the end of the War and it was reported that he committed suicide (four different versions). If he were dead, why the secrecy? Kammler was regarded as \"the most important man in Germany outside the Cabinet.\" The chain of command was Hitler to Himmler to Himmler's Deputy SS General Karl Wolff to SS General Oswald Pohl to Kammler, and later the link was more direct. Dr. Wilhelm Voss told Agoston what happened to Kammler was a \"hot matter\" that could not be revealed. Agoston said one of Kammler's close associates was Rudolph Hess, who flew to Britain on a secret mission in May 1941. \"The secret British file that might explain why he flew to Britain will remain closed until the year 2020\" (p.160). What clinched the proof for me was when I read in Phoenix Journal #18 (*Blood And Ashes*), speaking of the Manhattan Project, \"Of course, they utilized the German production urn and, actually, the bomb used on Japan was constructed in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:171:abdb0f7f35de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9871, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "said one of Kammler's close associates was Rudolph Hess, who flew to Britain on a secret mission in May 1941. \"The secret British file that might explain why he flew to Britain will remain closed until the year 2020\" (p.160).

The author of those Journals is \"One Who Knows.\" GERMAN SUBMARINES IN SOUTH ATLANTIC The newspaper *France Soir* had the following account: \"Almost 1-1/2 years after cessation of hostilities in Europe, the Islandic Whaler, \"Juliana\" was stopped by a large German U-boat. The Juliana was in the Antarctic region around Malvinas [now Falkland] Islands when a German submarine surfaced and raised the German official naval Flag of Mourning - red with a black edge. The submarine commander sent out a boarding party, which approached the Juliana in a rubber dinghy, and having boarded the whaler demanded of Capt. Hekla part of his fresh food stocks. The request was made in the definite tone of an order to which resistance would have been unwise. The German officer spoke a correct English and paid for his provisions in U.S. dollars, giving the Captain a bonus of $10 for each member of the Juliana crew. Whilst the food stuffs were being transferred to the submarine, the submarine commander informed Capt. Hekla of the exact location of a large school of whales. Later the Juliana found the school of whales where designated.\" The French *Agence France Press* on 25 September 1946, said: \"The continuous rumours about German U-boat activity in the region of Tierra del Fuego (Feuerland, in German), between the southernmost tip of Latin America and the continent of Antarctica are based on true happenings.\" There have been stories and books written about Germans counterfeiting U.S. currency and otherwise obtaining American money printing plates, which may account for the German use of American money. The Guinness Book of World Records says that the \"greatest unsolved robbery\" was the disappearance of the entire German treasury at the end of the war. RAND CORPORATION In January 1946 industrialist Donald Douglas approached the Army Air Force with a plan for government and industry to work together on long range strategic planning. This was called Project RAND, a name coined by Arthur Raymond from Research ANd Development. Much of their first government money went to the von Braun team.

LESLIE R. GROVES Groves is known as the General in charge of the Manhattan Project which built the Atomic Bomb. He was chosen because he is the one who supervised the building of the Pentagon, and by 1942 was in charge of all U.S. military construction everywhere. After the war he went to work for Remington Rand Corporation. BORIS PASH \"The stakes in the search for the scientific expertise of Germany were high. The single most important American strike force, for example, was the Alsos raiding team, which targeted Axis atomic research, uranium stockpiles, and nuclear scientists, as well as Nazi chemical and biological warfare research. The commander of this assignment was U.S. Army Colonel Boris Pash, who had previously been security chief of the Manhattan Project - the United States' atomic bomb development program - and who later played an important role in highly secret U.S. covert action programs. Pash succeeded brilliantly in his mission, seizing top German scientists and more than 70,000 tons of Axis uranium ore and radium products. The uranium taken during these raids was eventually shipped to the United States and incorporated in U.S. atomic weapons.\" (Simpson, Christopher, *Blowback,* Collier Books, New York, 1988, p. 26.) \"Another notable Bloodstone veteran is Boris Pash, a career intelligence officer identified in the Final Report of the U.S. Senate's 1975-1976 investigation into U.S. intelligence activities as the retired director of the CIA unit responsible for planning assassinations\" (*Blowback,* p. 108). *Blowback,* p. 152-153 says: \"The records of Operation Bloodstone add an important new piece of information to one of the most explosive public issues of today: the role of the U.S. government - specifically the CIA - in assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign officials. According to a 1976 Senate investigation, a key official of Operation Bloodstone is the OPC officer who was specifically delegated responsibility for planning the agency's assassinations, kidnappings, and similar 'wet work.' \"Colonel Boris Pash, one of the most extraordinary and least known characters in American intelligence history... his work for U.S. intelligence agencies places him in the critical office given the responsibility for planning postwar assassination operations...

(More than a decade later it was Colonel Pash's testimony that helped seal the fate of scientist Robert Oppenheimer in the well-known 1954 security case.) Before the war was out, it will be recalled, Colonel Pash led the series of celebrated special operations known as the Alsos Mission that were designed to capture the best atomic and chemical warfare experts that the Nazis had to offer. \"After the war Colonel Pash served as the army's representative on Bloodstone in the spring of 1948, when the tasks of that project, including recruiting defectors, smuggling refugees out from behind the Iron Curtain, and assassinations, were established. Bloodstone's 'special operations,' as defined by the Pentagon, could 'include clandestine warfare, subversion, sabotage and... assassination,' according to the 1948 Joint Chiefs of Staff records. In March 1949, Pash was assigned by the army to the OPC division of the CIA... His five-man CIA unit, known as PB/7, was given a written charter that read in part that 'PB/7 will be responsible for assassinations, kidnapping, and such other functions as from time to time may be given it... by higher authority.'\" From *Dulles* by Leonard Mosley (A Biography of Eleanor, Allen and John Foster. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1978.), we find, p. 459: \"But now he [Allen Dulles] was interested in the more sinister Agency experiments in mind-bending drugs, portable phials of lethal viruses, and esoteric poisons that killed without trace. Allen's sense of humor was touched when he learned that the unit working on these noxious enterprises was called the *Health Alteration Committee* (directed by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and Boris Pash)...

One of the people they killed was Frank Olson (a CIA germ warfare doctor whose specialty was anthrax), while they were working on Subproject-68, also known as MK-ULTRA.

MK-ULTRA started as *Project Bluebird,* set up on April 20, 1950, by CIA Director Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (who later was a member of NICAP), and on July 20, 1950, they began using sodium amytal, Benzedrine and other drugs to \"brainwash\" prisoners. In September 1950, the *Miami News* published an article under the headline BRAIN WASHING TACTICS which was considered the first formal use of the term. One of Gottlieb's partners was Dr. Harold Wolff, who appears to be a Paperclip doctor. He worked with Parke-Davis and \"...remained closely connected with the M-K Ultra brainwashing project\" (p. 191). He helped set up an apartment and introduce LSD to the hippies in San Francisco, and worked on Project Mindbender (a Manchurian-Candidate type operation) with William Buckley. Isn't it interesting that so many of the participants in the most secret of secrets of World War II are still very involved in the Kennedy assassination and other more current affairs. Many books and articles have been written about the CIA being involved in the JFK assassination, and now you know that the man in charge of CIA assassinations was Boris Pash, formerly chief of security for the Manhattan Project. He was also head of the group trying to capture Hitler's advanced technology, including \"flying saucers\" and other secrets. The book *ZR Rifle - The Plot To Kill Kennedy And Castro* by Claudia Furiati, p. 36, says that a man named William Harvey had been in charge of the CIA post in West Berlin until 1960, then was placed in charge of CIA assassinations by Richard Bissell in 1961. The plans to assassinate political leaders was code-named *ZR-RIFLE,* headed by Harvey. Bo Gritz said on p. 525 of his book: \"The Kennedy assassination was code-named 'ZR-RIFLE'.\" It seems apparent to me that Harvey and Pash were wearing the same pair of pants. In 1941, Ian Fleming, the future creator of the \"James Bond\" stories, and at that time a high ranking officer of British Intelligence, suggested to William Donovan that he set up a specially trained and selected assassination unit. PB/7 (Pash Boris Seven) was the original of the \"Agent 007\" concept. If my memory is correct, I believe Nixon stated that William Harvey was the real 007. I assume Pash was Agent 001, or perhaps he had seven agents working for him (originally five).

If you want to understand more of how these various factions such as CIA, KGB, Nazis, Communists, FBI, etc., can be fighting each other and working together at the same time, you need to understand who was above them, controlling them. To understand that, look to British Intelligence! You will find British Intelligence to be an operation of British and European Royalty and \"Aristocracy\"! E. Howard Hunt, while in prison in December, 1975, in an interview with the *New York Times,* said that the head of the CIA assassination unit was Boris Pash. Pash was assigned to Angleton at this time (see *Final Judgment,* p. 207). Angleton was head of the Israel desk of the CIA and was very pro-Israel. He was also closely involved with Meyer Lansky. In *Cold Warrior,* the biography of James Jesus Angleton by Tom Mangold, he says on page 362: \"I would like to place on the record, however, that Angleton's closest professional friends overseas, then and subsequently, came from the Mossad (the Israeli intelligence-gathering service) and that he was held in immense esteem by his Israeli colleagues and by the state of Israel, which was to award him profound honors after his death.\" His place was taken after his death by William Colby. When Kissinger wanted to \"get LaRouche,\" he turned to Angleton for help. Angleton's tombstone is in Hebrew. On page 97 of *Final Judgment,* Piper says that \"The ZR/Rifle Team, in fact, was one of Angleton's pet in-house CIA projects, which he ran in conjunction with his CIA colleague, William Harvey.\" According to Claudia Furiati, Joseph Schreider was in charge of the CIA laboratories and of developing poisons for assassinations, and says that Harvey was in charge of political assassinations, working out of the Miami office run by [Paperclip] Shackley, and was working with Schreider to try to poison Castro. Above we have Boris Pash and Sidney Gottlieb working together in the same manner.

END OF PART 27. PART 28: GERMAN FLYING SAUCERS Hitler's advanced technology included intercontinental ballistic missiles, vertical takeoff aircraft, jet engines, cruise missiles, sound cannons, and many other advanced items. The Allies captured plans for what became the Boeing 747 Jumbo jet. Among the most secret items captured were plans for flying disks, that were at first called \"Krautmeteors.\" Based on the evidence, they were built as early as around 1933 and went into mass production in 1940. Scientists involved in these projects were Bellonzo, Schriever, Miethe and Victor Schauberger. Schauberger developed the \"flying hat\" type disc that was later seen over the United States. The final version was the Bellonzo-Schriever-Miethe Diskus, as large as 135 feet and some up to 225 feet in diameter. They traveled over 2,000 km/hr and were planned to go over 4,000 km/hr. In 1945 they could reach a speed of 1,300 mph and an altitude of 40,000 feet in less than three minutes. The Germans developed the Delta wing craft, and were working on stealth technology, etc. Many pilots saw the strange craft over Germany. However, as soon as a craft was built, Hitler ordered it disassembled and shipped somewhere - probably Antarctica. None of the craft were captured by the Allies, although some of the scientists were captured and then mostly disappeared, but can somewhat be traced to Bell Textron and to places such as Area 51, which, surprise!, is infamous for its UFO sightings. Here are some examples of news items during WW II concerning Germany's UFOs, from the *New York Times:* *NEW YORK TIMES,* December 14, 1944: \"Floating Mystery Ball Is New German Weapon. SUPREME HEADQUARTERS, Allied Expeditionary Force, Dec. 13 - A new German weapon has made its appearance on the western air front, it was disclosed today. \"Airmen of the American Air Force report that they are encountering silver colored spheres in the air over German territory. The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters. Sometimes they are semi-translucent.\" and, \"SUPREME HEADQUARTERS Dec. 13 (Reuters) - The Germans have produced a \"secret\" weapon in keeping with the Christmas season. \"The new device, apparently an air defense weapon, resembles the huge glass balls that adorn Christmas trees.

They also invested in corporations in Germany and elsewhere, with plans to make a comeback. They used the German treasury, captured treasure from other nations, and counterfeit American currency printed on real U.S. currency printing plates given to the Russians and captured by the Germans. Some plates were stolen by Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Harry Dexter White (real name Weiss) under Henry Morgenthau and sent to the Soviets for use in occupied Germany. He also arranged for the mass theft of tons of our special money-paper. When J. Edgar Hoover went to President Truman with all the evidence that the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury was a Communist spy and thief, Truman of course removed Weiss (White) from his job - and promoted him to head of the International Monetary Fund. I kid you not, look it up. The story has a rather common ending - when a controversy developed in the press concerning this incident, Weiss became a \"suicide.\" GERMAN ECONOMIC \"MIRACLE\" For more information on how the \"economic miracle\" was accomplished after the war by the Germans, you can read such books as *Martin Bormann, Nazi in Exile* by Paul Manning (\"...Bormann became the guiding force in the 'economic miracle' that led to the rebirth of German industry and finance in the thirty-five years following political and military defeat. In the waning months of World War II, as the Third Reich was tottering and finally crumbling in defeat, Bormann set up 750 corporations scattered among those nations that had remained neutral. Those corporations received the fleeing wealth of Germany and became the power base that enabled Germany to climb back to economic and political strength.\" From flyleaf).

Many of these documents had been SECRET until declassification to fulfill our request. One document was No. 19,489, November 27, 1944, Subject: Transmitting Intelligence Report No. EW-Pa 198 [?, barely readable] by G-2 Economic Section, the Secretary of State, from Lt. Col. John W. Easton, Economic Warfare Division. The cover letter stated \"I have the honor to enclose Intelligence Report No. EW-Pa 198 by G-2 Economic Section, SHAEF [*Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces*], dated November 7, 1944, describing the plans of German industrialists for the post-war resurrection of Germany. Among the topics dealt with in this report are: patents, financial reserves, exportation of capital, and the strategic placing of technical personnel.\" It is obvious that Manning quoted from these documents in his book on Bormann. In describing the meeting of August 10,1944, in Stasbourg, some sentences in the documents stand out: \"German industrialists must, it was said, through their exports increase the strength of Germany. They must also prepare themselves to finance the Nazi Party which would be forced to go underground as Maquis (in Gebirgverteidigungsstellengehen). From now on the government would allocate large sums to industrialists so that each could establish a secure post-war foundation in foreign countries. Existing financial reserves in foreign countries must be placed at the disposal of the Party so that a strong German Empire can be created after the defeat. It is also immediately required that the large factories in Germany create small technical offices or research bureaus which would be absolutely independent and have no known connection with the factory. These bureaus will receive plans and drawings of *new weapons* as well as documents which they need to continue their research and which must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy\" [author emphasis]. The last sentences in this document are, \"After the defeat of Germany the Nazi Party recognizes that certain of its best known leaders will be condemned as war criminals. However, in cooperation with the industrialists it is arranging to place its less conspicuous but most important members in positions with various German factories as technical experts or members of its research and designing offices.\" Some of the documents were concerning \"Looted Gold (1945-1948).

One important paragraph (#9) says: \"It is clear both from correspondence and from testimony that the management of the B.I.S. during the war was 'in the hands of the Administration Council, in which the Axis representatives have an authoritative influence,' and that in 1942 the Germans favored the reelection of President McKittrick whose 'personal opinions' they characterized as 'safely known'.\" Enclosed in the file is a clipping from the *New York Times,* date not included but appears to be in 1945, that states: \"McKITTRICK SLATED FOR POST AT CHASE. He Will Take Over Duties as Vice President of Bank Here Next Autumn. Thomas H. McKittrick, American banker who has served as president of the Bank for International Settlements [B.I.S.] since the beginning of 1940, will become a vice president of the Chase National Bank of New York next fall, Winthrop W. Aldrich, chairman of the board of Chase, announced yesterday.\" The article ends by quoting McKittrick: \"I realize it is my duty to perform a neutral task in wartime. It is an extremely difficult and trying thing to do, but I do the best I can.\" Another formerly Top Secret document declassified was \"Subject: Conversation in Switzerland with Mr. McKittrick, President of the Bank for International Settlements\" from Orvis A. Schmidt to Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, dated March 23, 1945. It describes McKittrick's dealings with the real head of the Nazi banking system, a Vice President named Puhl. \"Puhl was described by McKittrick as a career banker who had been with the Reichsbank for some twenty years, who does not share the Nazi point of view... the Swiss National Bank said that in order to be sure they were not obtaining looted gold they had requested a member of the Reichsbank, whom they regarded to be trustworthy, to certify that each parcel of gold which they purchased had not been looted. The person who had done this certifying was Puhl.\" Puhl was Reichsbank Senior Vice President Emil Johann Rudolf Puhl. He was in charge of taking booty into the bank and was in charge of it for the Nazis. His Senior Shipping Clerk Albert Thoms said that they needed up to thirty men to help him sort and repack the valuables, which consisted of \"millions in gold marks, pounds sterling, dollars and Swiss francs, 3,500 ounces of platinum, over 550,000 ounces of gold, and 4,638 carats in diamonds and other precious stones, as well as hundreds of pieces of works of art\" (p. 226, *Aftermath,* Ladislas Farago, Avon, 1974).

This material was shipped out of the country in Operation Fireland or Aktion Feuerland in German, which Farago explained in a footnote in his book on Bormann: \"The transaction was named 'Land of Fire' after the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego at the southern extremity of Argentina and Chile, the area to which some of the shipments were originally consigned\" (p. 228). On the next page Farago said: \"Only a relatively small portion of the SS treasure was impounded by Bormann and sent overseas in the course of Aktion Feuerland. Much of it is still missing.\" Germany had developed self-sufficiency before the end of the war, and was manufacturing their own oil, produced \"butter\" from coal, invented powdered milk, developed freeze drying, learned to store flour indefinitely, were growing their food in greenhouses on chemical \"soil,\" etc. These projects were also necessary for survival of the secret UFO force, which Hitler called the \"Last Battalion,\" at the Antarctic. The counterfeiting of British and American money was under Operation Bernhard. The fake British notes have been often discussed in books and articles about Bernhard, but the fake American currency is not as well known. Recently the U.S. announced that it was issuing new money to counteract the counterfeit, which was said to be coming from Saddam Hussein and Lebanon. It would be more correct to say it is coming from South America, but that money is supposed to all be drug money. Life gets complicated. When *CONTACT* newspaper first ran the series on *Fire From The Sky,* it followed with a reprint of the information about the truth about the Falkland Islands War. In that series, it revealed that the Russians, working with Rockefeller forces, defeated the British Bolshevik forces on South Georgia Island. If you have not read that series, this information may not make sense to you. It is important to know that information, if you intend to try to understand what is happening. Nazi forces were involved in the Falkland Islands War, on the side of the Russians. This is hard to believe if you have no idea of what IS. The Russians were nationalists, as opposed to the Zionist Bolsheviks who took their country away from them. The Zionist Bolsheviks were trained in the lower East Side of New York City and financed by New York and London bankers. They invaded Russia, killed the Tzar and many Nationalists and took over", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:181:e44b5bc2a1fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9881, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 182, "text": "happening.

Can you begin to see how someone like Boris Pash, with a Russian Nationalist family background, could work with Nazi Gestapo and SS agents? Even the American General George Patton said we should have fought WITH the Nazis against the Bolshevik Communists. Patton said there was an international conspiracy of Zionist bankers who were the world's problem (see *Patton's Papers,* Vol. 2, p. 735 for example). In 1982, on April 20, Hitler's birthday, the Russian/Rockefeller/Nazi commando force broke through and inserted a neutron bomb into the underground naval base at South Georgia Island.

In his book *Caveat,* the chapter on the Falklands starts: \"On March 28, 1982, a Sunday, the British Ambassador, Nicholas (\"Niko\") Henderson, brought me a letter from Lord Carrington. A party of Argentineans, wrote the foreign secretary, had landed nine days earlier on the island of South Georgia, a British possession lying in the South Atlantic a few degrees above the Antarctic Circle and some 600 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, a British Crown colony.\" I'll bet you thought the Falkland Islands War was about the Falkland Islands! Much ado was made in the media about the conflict between Jeane Kirkpatrick and Alexander Haig. Kirkpatrick is a Zionist and was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. She has a regular feature column in *The Jewish Press* newspaper, \"The Largest Independent Anglo-Jewish Weekly Newspaper.\" Haig has had a long relationship with Henry Kissinger, to whom Haig became senior military advisor in 1969. Remember that Kissinger came out of the Paperclip Operation personnel. In January 1982, Reagan replaced his national security advisor, Richard Allen, with William P. Clark, another Paperclip person, and who was Haig's deputy. Nixon said, \"When you see the lights burning late in Henry's [Kissinger] office, it's usually Al Haig.\" (*War In The Falklands, the Full Story* by the *Sunday Times* of London Insight Team, Harper", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:182:0c43bff4dcba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9882, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 183, "text": "long relationship with Henry Kissinger, to whom Haig became senior military advisor in 1969.

END OF PART 28. PART 29: If you doubt the fact that the Nazis never gave up and that they planned to continue the war after their defeat in Germany, and planned to make a comeback to finally achieve their goal, then perhaps you should read the following books: Connell, Brian, *A Watcher On The Rhine,* William Morrow & Co., New York, 1957. \"Old wine in new bottles,\" how the Nazis have come back into power.

You can obtain the book probably from *Spotlight* Newspaper if you can't find it otherwise. Sutton, Anthony C., *Wall Street And The Rise Of Hitler, '76 Press, Seal Beach, Calif., 1976. ALBERT EINSTEIN Albert Einstein is a good example of another deception and hoax involved with the atomic bomb program. When many people think of the atomic bomb they think of Einstein. He was presented as the world's greatest scientist, and a hero of the atomic bomb program. Upon closer inspection, you will find that his major contributions were his use of his influence to obtain President Roosevelt's support for the bomb and he was the one personally responsible for bringing the major Communist atomic spy Klaus Fuchs into the Program. The Russians know nothing about the atomic bomb until Fuchs brought it to their attention in 1942. (*Heisenberg's War,* p. 524). Thanks to Fuchs, (and to a massive amount of Secret material illegally shipped through Lend-Lease) they were able to explode their own bomb in 1949. Einstein was a communist cell member with Fuchs. Fuchs was the top scientist on the Manhattan Project and he gave the atomic secrets to the Soviets. (Jordan, George Recey, *From Major Jordan's Diaries,* Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York, 1952.) We are taught that Einstein is the author of the Theory of Relativity, yet evidence has come for the proving that the real author was Mileva Maric, Einstein's first wife. Einstein had a reputation at the Swiss Polytechnic Institute in Zurich of being a man with poor work habits and was often reprimanded for laziness during all his school years, including the University. He developed a romance with classmate Mileva who helped him with his math. His autobiography says \"In my work participated a Serbian student Mileva Maric who I married later.\" She had an illegitimate daughter in 1902, which they gave up for adoption. They got married in 1903, separated in 1912 and divorced in 1919. This is when Einstein married his cousin Elsa. The original manuscript of the *The Theory of Relativity* submitted for publication had Maric's name on it as co-author. For more proof, see the article \"Theory of Relativity - Who is its Real Author?\" by Dr. Rastko Maglic and J. W. McGinnis,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:184:41fb2295ec83", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9884, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 185, "text": "Maric who I married later.\" She had an illegitimate daughter in 1902, which they gave up for adoption.

The original manuscript of the *The Theory of Relativity* submitted for publication had Maric's name on it as co-author. For more proof, see the article \"Theory of Relativity - Who is its Real Author?\" by Dr. Rastko Maglic and J. W. McGinnis, President, International Tesla Society, in the Jul/Aug 1994 issue of *Extraordinary Science* magazine, which contains references for further documentation. Einstein was a hoax and fraud saddled on the scientific community to prevent them from learning too much and to promote Jews as being superior, sort of Nazism in reverse. Einstein's famous equation \"E=MC squared\" is WRONG, or at best only partially correct. His definition of energy is WRONG, his definition of mass is WRONG, C is defined as the top speed possible for anything, then it is squared, which would be even faster and thus contradicts the definition. Light is described as a constant, which is WRONG as defined. In a higher understanding, light does not move, our perception of the speed of light is WRONG. Those who REALLY understand, and who can prove it by creating matter out of \"nothing\" for instance, say that the original WHITE LIGHT is invisible and still. Read books by Walter Russell for more information. Einstein was a Zionist with membership in at least 16 Communist front organizations such as Friends of the Soviet. Einstein was head of the Jewish Black Book Committee, which was listed as a Communist front in the 1947 House Un-American Activities Committee Report. The correct science being discovered and revealed by such as Nikola Tesla, Walter Russell, Tom Bearden, Andrija Puharich, etc., was suppressed to prevent humanity from achieving energy independence (and thus political and military independence) from the Rockefeller/Rothschild oil/nuclear energy barons. This same technology leads to understanding of good health, and thus independence from the drug/medical crowd, who happen to be the same oil crowd crooks. PAUL ROSBAUD Rosbaud was one of Britain's top spies in Nazi Germany. He worked as scientific adviser for the publishing firm of Springer Verlag. He came to know Albert Einstein, Peter Kapitsa, Niels Bohr, Ernest Rutherford, Leo Szilard, Otto Hahn, and others of importance in the quest for the Bomb. Kapitsa was the one later credited by Tom Bearden with creating Russia's advanced Tesla technology weapons. Kapitsa won the Nobel Prize in 1978 for his work on the physics of low temperatures and very strong magnetic fields, areas that were pursued in developing anti-gravity platforms. Rosbaud was code named The Griffin. History books say that the Allies found out from The Griffin that Germany did not have the atomic bomb, and thus the military could advance with more confidence.

A book entitled *The Griffin* by Arnold Karmish (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1986, on page 199, chapter titled \"Double-Cross\" tells of this): \"On Sunday, December 26, 1943, the day the *Scharnhorst* was sunk, the major headline in the London *Sunday Express* was THE SECRET WEAPON MAY NOT COME OFF. Beneath it was a long and accurate feature article by Kai Siegbahn, the son of Lise Meitner's reluctant host, Manne Siegbahn. He explained the fundamentals of nuclear energy and described the prewar research. As for the bomb, Siegbahn concluded: 'Despite all the secretiveness about researching in the uranium problem, I venture to say that the uranium bomb is still non-existent, except as a research objective It is rather difficult to say if it is possible at all to construct such a bomb, but for the present it seems as if an essential link is missing for making the uranium bomb a reality.' Even more remarkable, the *Sunday Express* went beyond Siegbahn's opinion to assure its readers that 'it may therefore be a source of consolation to know that able Swedish atoms-scientists believe that the Germans have not succeeded in creating atom explosives.' The *Express* explained its sources for the information by saying, 'Swedish scientists had close contacts with German scientists until the Germans recently arrested Norwegian professors and students.' Among those recently arrested was, of course, Odd Hassel. \"Press security on the atomic bomb was extremely tight in the United States and even tighter in Britain, so the article's appearance seemed at first a puzzle. The *Express* was owned by William Maxwell Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, formerly minister of war production and now lord privy seal. Lord Beaverbrook was intimately familiar with the history of the atomic bomb project and its present course, and he was in constant touch with his editors about what they should print. It was quite clear, then, that Kai Siegbahn's article was no accident - but what was its purpose? \"It was not hard to discern the reassuring purpose of the message to the British public. Rumors about Hitler's secret weapons had been rife, and the actions against Rjukan had focused attention on the bomb. But the Gestapo and the Abwehr also read the British papers. \"From the exploit of Jacques Allier to the attacks on the Norwegian installations, the Germans had kept reading the lesson that heavy water was essential for atomic research and that the Allies would do", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:186:9b392bc1c734", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9886, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 187, "text": "\"It was not hard to discern the reassuring purpose of the message to the British public. Rumors about Hitler's secret weapons had been rife, and the actions against Rjukan had focused attention on the bomb. But the Gestapo and the Abwehr also read the British papers. \"From the exploit of Jacques Allier to the attacks on the Norwegian installations, the Germans had kept reading the lesson that heavy water was essential for atomic research and that the Allies would do anything to halt production. Now, an article by a distinguished neutral scientist - apparently published with official approval - carried the strong implication that the British were still in a research stage and without much hope of 'making the uranium bomb a reality.' \"The article was, of course, a deliberate SIS plant, conceived in the Double-Cross Committee (The XX Committee), chaired by John Masterman of MI-5.\" Lies were and are standard operating procedure for both sides. The article continues: \"The top SIS expert on the Abwehr was Frank Foley [who worked with Masterman] of Section V, so he was recruited to the XX Committee as a senior advisor. In the early months, his work was interrupted by a special assignment, conducting the lengthy interrogation of Rudolf Hess. When he returned four months later, Foley took up the deception business once more.\" So you see that the ones involved with lying about the bomb were the same ones very interested in what was said by Rudolf Hess. Hess' information remained highly classified long after the war, until he was recently murdered so that they could close Spandau Prison and keep him from talking. In the book *Journey Into Madness, The True Story of Secret CIA Mind Control And Medical Abuse* by Gordon Thomas, p. 152, tells of one of the heads of the CIA mind-control programs, Dr. Grant Cameron, going to Nuremberg to \"establish the state of mind of Rudolf Hess.\" I wonder if that is \"establish\" as in \"to determine,\" or as in \"to create.\" Rosbaud was a close friend with Goudsmit who ran Operation Alsos with Boris Pash. Goudsmit \"formed a close friendship with Rosbaud that endured until Paul died\" (p. 241). After the war, Rosbaud formed Pergamon Press with Robert Maxwell. Maxwell went on to become a British \"press baron\" (p. 250, *The Griffin*) and was working with the Israeli Mossad selling Israeli briefcase nuclear bombs like the ones used in the New York Trade Center bombing. (Interview with Galen Winsor by Tom Valentine, *Radio Free America,* March 23, 1993. These bombs were used by Special Forces as early as 1960 per Sgt. Joe Garner, \"Army vet tested nuclear 'suitcase bombs' in 60s,\" *Houston Chronicle,* January 23, 1995.

Also see \"Backpack Nukes for 'Nam, Inside SF's Super-Secret A-Bomb Project\" in *Soldier Of Fortune,* May 1995.) The information that spy Rosbaud, who was Jewish, provided is mentioned in a U.S. Department of Justice memorandum dated April 26, 1955, which reads: \"[Rosbaud] returned to Germany determined to assist England and its allies at all costs. This he accomplished. The records in this matter contain official corroboration that Dr. Rosbaud remained in Berlin during World War II for the purpose of obtaining certain technical intelligence for the United States and the United Kingdom. This information was extremely useful and invaluable for the allied cause and involved great risk on the part of Dr. Rosbaud. His activities on behalf of the allied cause were successful and of such importance that even today they cannot be disclosed and are still highly classified.\" When you read the book, you see that the most important information that Rosbaud provided was the non-existent status of the German bomb. Yet, the exact details are still \"highly classified.\" So what's the big deal, why is the information still above top secret (top secret items have been declassified)? Makes one wonder, doesn't it? Another curious \"coincidence\" is that, after Samisdat published the Nazi UFO information, two journalists from Springer Publishers flew to Toronto to interview Ernst Zundel (head of Samisdat) in person. Samisdat used to sell an audiotape of the interview. SAMUEL ABRAHAM GOUDSMIT Another curiosity is Goudsmit. He turns up in interesting places. He supported Oppenheimer during Oppenheimer's espionage trials. The APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, founded in 1952) *Bulletin,* August 1975, contained information obtained from declassified (and well sanitized) CIA records concerning the Robertson Panel which was convened in 1953 to study UFOs. Dr. H.P. Robertson was an expert in cosmology at California Institute of Technology, director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and a CIA classified employee. The panel was convened by the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and included Dr. Samuel Abraham Goudsmit, theoretical physicist and Chairman of the Physics Department, Brookhaven National Laboratories. Goudsmit was rather a heavy dude to be \"wasting\" time on UFOs that the government maintained did not exist. Other OSI panel members were Panel Chairman Dr. Howard Percy Robertson, on leave from his job as professor of Mathematical Physics at California Institute of Technology to be full time to OSI; physicist Dr. Luis Walter Alvarez, University of California, Berkeley, a specialist in magnetism and microwaves (it was speculated that the Roswell UFO was shot down by microwaves) and according to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:188:2ead29992d97", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9888, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 189, "text": "was rather a heavy dude to be \"wasting\" time on UFOs that the government maintained did not exist.

Berkner is generally listed as a member of Majestic-12 and the Jason Group); astronomer Dr. Thornton Leigh Page, Deputy Director, Office of Operations Research, Johns Hopkins University and formerly a physicist with *Naval* ordnance. Others included Frederick Clark Durant, a rocket engineer; astronomer Dr. Joseph Allen Hynek, Ohio (home of Wright-Patterson) State University who was also a consultant to the U.S. Air Force Air Technical Intelligence Center (which did the UFO Blue Book Project). The Panel interviewed a long list of Generals and Chiefs and other Big Boys and Heavy Dudes. Fred Durant met regularly with Stuart Nixon, assistant to John Acuff, head of NICAP. (Timothy Good, *Above Top Secret,* William Morrow & Co., New York, 1988, p. 349.) Durant worked with von Braun, Krafft Ehricke, Harvard astronomer Fred Whipple, Maryland physicist Fred Singer, Navy Commander George Hoover and others on Ehricke's Moonbase and Marsbase projects. Army General John Medaris was in charge of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency over von Braun and on March 20, 1959, received a directive for a study of a manned lunar base. \"General Medaris organized a crash effort to carry out the study, which became Project Horizon. Less than three months later, on June 8, the study was completed. On the first page of the study (four or five volumes of which have been declassified), the conclusions are stated: Military, political and scientific considerations indicate that it is imperative for the United States to establish a lunar outpost at the earliest practicable date... Project Horizon represents the earliest feasible capability for the U.S. to establish a lunar outpost\" [Project Horizon 1959, vol. 1, p. 1]. (Marsha Freeman, *How We Got To The Moon, The Story of the German Space Pioneers,* 21st Century Science Associates, Washington, D.C., 1993, p. 210.) Ehricke worked with Dornberger at Bell until 1954 when he went with Convair Astronautics in California which was in charge of building space stations and the lunar base. *The Washington Star,* December 29, 1958, described the Convair station as \"the brainchild of Krafft Ehricke.\" Durant, Whipple and George Hoover were part of the Office of Naval Research. Whipple's assistant, J.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:189:ef5a465d24e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9889, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "Got To The Moon, The Story of the German Space Pioneers,* 21st Century Science Associates, Washington, D.C., 1993, p. 210.)

Whipple's assistant, J. Allen Hynek, was part of the Robertson Panel, as was Durant. In UFO researcher William Steinman's correspondence with Grant Cameron, he states: \"I contacted Dr. Alvarez in private, when he admitted that he did take part in the recovery of a saucer in Mexico. He would not go into detail concerning the events and who else was involved.\" Steinman wrote the book *UFO Crash At Aztec* which is an excellent source for more information on these men. Unfortunately it is a large, heavily documented book but with no index. Dr. Lloyd Berkner is also listed in *Assault On The Unknown, The International Geophysical Year* as the head of the American part of the International Geophysical Year study. He was radio man on the first Byrd Expedition to the Antarctic and developed the sounder that charts the radio-reflecting layers of the atmosphere. Berkner was Chairman of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Operation Highjump is not mentioned, but Berkner was part of Operation Deepfreeze at the Antarctic in 1957-1958, headed by Byrd until his death, as were Werner von Braun and Frederick C. Durant. Berkner became a Navy Rear Admiral. Another Antarctic scientist was Dr. Carl Augustus Heiland, who worked with Vannevar Bush and who was part of the on-site recovery team of the Aztec UFO crash (p. 85, *UFO Crash At Aztec*). He appears to be a Paperclip scientist, as he received his Doctorate from the University of Hamburg. Another very important scientist was Dr. Eric Henry Wang. I will not go into his story at this time, except to quote Steinman: \"The subject of Dr. Eric Henry Wang remains one of the most touchy and sensitive areas in all ufology\" (p. 282). Dr. Eric Wang was head of the Office of Special Studies of the Air Materials Command at Wright-Patterson AFB. He was an Austrian-born graduate of the Vienna Technical Institute and \"a close associate of Victor Schauberger.\" (Hamilton, William F., *Cosmic Top Secret,* Inner Light, 1991, p. 23.) Steinman's book has a whole chapter on Nazi German \"flying disk\" projects, many of which used Schauberger's designs. Goudsmit concluded that UFO sightings were \"due to a formation of ducks or other birds.\" The official conclusion of the panel was that interest in UFOs was dangerous and that the situation should be downplayed and covered up. Jacobs said that Robertson showed the final report of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:190:268f589aae23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9890, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 191, "text": "of Victor Schauberger.\" (Hamilton, William F., *Cosmic Top Secret,* Inner Light, 1991, p. 23.) Steinman's book has a whole chapter on Nazi German \"flying disk\" projects, many of which used Schauberger's designs. Goudsmit concluded that UFO sightings were \"due to a formation of ducks or other birds.\" The official conclusion of the panel was that interest in UFOs was dangerous and that the situation should be downplayed and covered up. Jacobs said that Robertson showed the final report of the panel to General Charles Cabell, director of Air Force intelligence and later Deputy Director of the CIA in charge of clandestine operations, \"who expressed satisfaction with it.\" Cabell's brother Earl was the Mayor of Dallas during the Kennedy assassination, and apparently was the one who ordered the motorcade to change routes into the ambush area. Earl later went to work for Howard Hughes. General Cabell was the person who briefed President Kennedy prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion. Robert Groden in *High Treason* quotes Victor Marchetti as saying that Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, Bernard Barker, Charles Cabell, and Richard Nixon \"were all working together in the CIA's Bay of Pigs planning operation.\" Kennedy later fired Cabell. Cabell and Richard Bissell were in charge of the U-2 program. Lee Harvey Oswald was given a job within one week of his arrival in Dallas working on maps for the U-2 flights (Jim Garrison, *On The Trail of The Assassins*). In 1957, Oswald was a radar operator at the U-2 base in Atsugi, Japan. General Cabell ordered the re-activation of Project Grudge on October 27, 1951, and on December 11, 1951, Major General John A. Stamford, \"having replaced Major General Cabell as director of intelligence, was given a full briefing of the service's UFO program by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt and Colonel Frank Dunn, chief of the Air Technical Intelligence Center.\" (Flammonde, Paris, *UFOs Exist!* Ballantine Books, New York, 1976, p. 392-393.) According to Leonard Moseley, *Dulles,* p. 366, Bissell \"was a friend of Frank Wisner, and had first met Foster [John Foster Dulles] when Eleanor threw a party at McLean for her brothers, Vice-President Nixon, Bob Bowie, and other members of the administration.\" I don't have the proof, but I'll bet that Cabell and Bissell and Boris Pash were very cozy, especially when Cabell was second in command under Allen Dulles. Recall that Wisner was the CIA head of the Gehlen Nazi spy group. END OF PART 29. PART 30: THE KENNEDY-NAZI CONNECTION JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, had a reputation of being pro-Nazi or at least pro-Hitler. Joe was a bootlegger and a member of the Mafia, although he hated the Jewish Mafia (Mishpucka) boss Meyer Lansky (real name Maier Suchowljansky). He was U.S. Ambassador to Britain but was recalled because of his pro-Hitler viewpoint. His code clerk was Tyler Kent, which is a story in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:191:a942b3339bda", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9891, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 192, "text": "CIA head of the Gehlen Nazi spy group.

He was U.S. Ambassador to Britain but was recalled because of his pro-Hitler viewpoint. His code clerk was Tyler Kent, which is a story in itself. In the book *Final Judgment* by Michael Collins Piper, you will find a story about DeWest Hooker. Hooker was a good friend of both Joseph Kennedy and George Lincoln Rockwell, Commander of the American Nazi Party. Piper tells of the arrangement made with Hooker and Rockwell to help JFK get elected. Hooker said, \"Frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it was my work that got Johnny Kennedy in the White House.\" I suggest you read the book, it is available from *Spotlight* Newspaper or Liberty Lobby. If I quote small portions from it you probably would find it too hard to believe! I assure you the story is true, for I know well the man who was the bodyguard and stenographer/scribe to Commander Rockwell. When Senator Joe McCarthy was conducting the hearings on Communists in the government, his assistant, seated at the same desk beside him, was Robert Kennedy. The Senator at the desk beside McCarthy was Senator John F. Kennedy. JFK was an *insider* who KNEW the source of the problems. When he became President, he fired the CIA heads, installed his brother as Attorney General, and said he was going to put the United States back on the silver standard, stop the Vietnam War, eliminate government involvement with the Mafia, and eliminate the Federal Reserve problem. It has also been reported that he was going to tell the truth about UFOs. Ten days after he gave a speech at Columbia University making these statements, he was murdered. NAZI IMBECILES? When Dornberger went to work for Bell, Bell recruited another former German army scientist, Krafft Ehricke, \"who had been an adviser on the German wartime atom bomb project\" according to Jack Manno, *Arming The Heavens* (Dodd, Mead & Co., 1948). We read a book that says Germany had no atomic bomb project, we read another that says they did. Manno said that Wolfgang Noggerath was brought in and put in charge of what became the Polaris missile. Willy Fiedler was brought in and made chief of planning of the underwater launch systems for submarines. Let me summarize for you the story as presented. We Americans were far ahead of the stupid Nazi Germans,although we had not yet made any atomic bombs. As the war was ending, we sent in teams and frantically searched for the German atomic scientists.

As the war was ending, we sent in teams and frantically searched for the German atomic scientists. We captured some of those dumb, incompetent scientists, quickly brought them to the United States in top secret programs that are still highly classified, we put those stupid losers in CHARGE of our projects, and we suddenly started making Atomic Bombs. An missiles - and satellites - and whatever else. I just want to be sure you got the story straight. COVER AND CONCEALMENT Speaking of lies and deception, it would be reasonable to think that if our spy satellites were destroyed in 1977, as stated in *Fire From The Sky,* then there would have been all kinds of repercussions and a lot of people who depend on those satellites would know about it. How was the truth kept secret? One part of the answer is revealed in a book called *The Falcon And The Snowman* by Robert Lindsey (Pocket Books, New York, 1979). This book tells the story of Christopher John Boyce. Boyce went to work for TRW on July 29, 1974. TRW is the company that made the Viking probe that went to Mars and the satellites which provided General George Keegan with information on the Russian activities at Semipalatinsk and such. Boyce worked in the top-secret \"black box\" section, he was the man with the keys and codes to access the vault. He had access to Projects Rhyolite, Argus, Pyramider and \"Project 20,030\" files, projects which involved spy satellite data coming to the American base at Pine Gap (code named Moreno), Australia, near Alice Springs. He learned things that upset him, such as the CIA interference in Australian elections, the U.S. was lying to other governments, etc. Read the book for more of the story. He began stealing and selling secret documents to the Russian Embassy in Mexico and in January, 1977, he was arrested and charged with espionage. \"It came out during the Boyce-Lee trial that data from these satellites goes to a readout station in Australia - but *not* the one that monitors the early warning satellites. Instead, the data goes to a CIA-run complex in a valley called Pine Gap. After the Pine Gap computers have processed the data, it goes to the TRW Defense and Space Systems headquarters in Redondo Beach, California\" (p.111, *The New High Ground* by Thomas Karas). It was claimed that as a result of his selling secrets to the Soviets, the Soviets changed and encoded their transmissions, camouflaged their facilities, etc., so that the spy satellites suddenly no longer", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:193:2c827950798a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9893, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 194, "text": "warning satellites. Instead, the data goes to a CIA-run complex in a valley called Pine Gap. After the Pine Gap computers have processed the data, it goes to the TRW Defense and Space Systems headquarters in Redondo Beach, California\" (p.111, *The New High Ground* by Thomas Karas). It was claimed that as a result of his selling secrets to the Soviets, the Soviets changed and encoded their transmissions, camouflaged their facilities, etc., so that the spy satellites suddenly no longer worked. Stansfield Turner, director of the CIA, said the results of Boyce's spying were \"distressing, perhaps appalling.\" As a result of his spying, we are told, the CIA no longer had satellite coverage of Iran, for instance, leading to the Iranian hostage crisis. Do you remember when the CIA was criticized for being surprised at the fall of the Shah and for not foreseeing the Iranian Hostage Crisis? In truth the U.S. DID know beforehand, as they orchestrated those events, but it is too much to try to cover here. Oh, what a tangled web... NOTHING is as it is presented to the public by our media and leaders. \"Our intelligence community is in disarray. A major satellite intelligence system, developed and deployed at a cost of billions of dollars over the past decade, without Soviet knowledge, has been compromised by intelligence procedures as porous as Swiss cheese.\" This was a statement made on December 8, 1878, by William Clements who was Deputy Secretary of Defense at the time Boyce worked in the Vault and who later became governor of Texas. Would you be surprised to learn that Boyce may have been manipulated/set-up? Even the author of the book noticed mysteries: \"Why TRW would place a $140-a-week, twenty-one-year-old college dropout in such a sensitive national-security position in the first place is, at least in retrospect, a puzzle. Circumstantially, TRW's decision to leave the Pyramider papers unlocked in the vault where Chris could read them shortly before his departure suggests they could have been left as bait. And there was the mystery of Daulton's [Boyce's assistant in crime] fingerprints on the circuit boards. An FBI fingerprint expert testified that he had found Daulton's prints on a circuit board from one of the encrypting machines in the vault. Yet both the two spies, when denials meant nothing regarding whether they might be convicted or not, insisted that Daulton had never entered the vault nor had he ever touched the circuit boards. And certainly, the presence of a U.S. Embassy official at the Soviet Embassy on the morning of Daulton's arrest added another curiousity to the case\" (p. 422). Boyce's partner Daulton claimed that all along he was working undercover for the CIA. \"The affair of the snowman and the spy who called himself the Falcon was an episode that demonstrated amazing ineptitude on the part of the Central Intelligence Agency\" (p. 423).", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:firefromthesky.txt:194:f8f1e40ba740", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9894, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "firefromthesky.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "firefromthesky", "chunk_index": 195, "text": "vault nor had he ever touched the circuit boards.

Boyce's partner Daulton claimed that all along he was working undercover for the CIA. \"The affair of the snowman and the spy who called himself the Falcon was an episode that demonstrated amazing ineptitude on the part of the Central Intelligence Agency\" (p. 423). Boyce's defense attorney George Chelius later developed a lucrative law practice in Orange County, California, catering to businessmen and land developers (p. 427). A similar event was when William Kampiles sold the Russians a complete manual on the KH-11 (sometimes called the Big Bird, but technically not the same) satellite in March 1978. Kampiles was an operations clerk at CIA headquarters and resigned in October 1977, just after the Russian destruction of our satellites. In February 1978 he went to Athens, Greece. On February 23, he went to the Soviet Embassy and started making arrangements to sell them the documents. He was arrested and went to trial in November 1978 and was sentenced to 40 years. The facility at Pine Gap, Australia, is something that needs a closer look. Stan Deyo, in *The Cosmic Conspiracy,* tells of a multi-national consortium at Pine Gap that have \"radical atmospheric vehicles.\" In other words, UFOs have been seen going in and out of Pine Gap. Deyo mentions that Dr. Vannevar Bush (claimed to be a member of MJ-12) made repeated visits to the area. Deyo says they are conducting research on crashed UFO residue at Pine Gap. I will close this section with something to ponder: Astronomer Dr. James Greenacre and four colleagues at a conference on \"Moon Problems\" in New York in 1964 said that on 29 October 1963 they observed several colorful spots on the moon that moved in formation. One month later Greenacre observed the same phenomena. The May 1966 issue of *UFO Nachrichten.* Vol. 117, said: \"Prof. Dr. Greenacre saw on or close to the moon at least 31 space craft of gigantic size. Some were from 300 meters to 4.8 kilometers long. They were in motion while being observed through the telescopes. Also, clearly discernible were numerous smaller craft approximately 150 meters in diameter, which moved past or alongside the huge craft, the 'mother craft' occasionally changing color, as in the often-reported, pulsating style.\" Keep looking up.

I have to smile at your statement \"Calvin is quite sensitive about any questioning of his conclusions about the world\" and you said I stopped communicating with you because of something you said. No, my friend, the medium of email does not convey the nuances of messages and people often misunderstand. If I was sensitive about what people thought about what I write I would not write it. I have no ill will nor any other negative feeling against you or your questions! I am just very busy, and I routinely get about 50 to 150 emails A DAY (many from this list) and I simply cannot keep up with all of it. By the way, I appreciate your posting the Fire From The Sky document on the internet, at the time I did not know how and was not even on the internet (except for some business networks that technically was internet I suppose). As to Bush, Hoover, etc. being shape-shifters, I did not think that was a question -- how would I know whether they are or not? Although in fact the Russians made their breakthrough in scalar technology in the 1970's and developed clones in the late 1970's using physics that involves holograms, which could lead to more understanding of the shape-shifting phenomena. At some point, everything in the universe is a shape-shifter. You can find more than you wanted to know on this from Tom Bearden, Walter Russell and David Icke.

It is explained in my Fire From the Sky document, the various internet versions of it may or may not contain the story. In the 1970's I worked in the secret section of Control Data Corporation in Sunnyvale, Calif. CDC had the world's most powerful computers at the time: the Cyber series, the Star 100, the Cray (Seymour Cray worked for Control Data. Later when he started his own company, Norris the owner of CDC financed the Cray Corporation and owned part of it). As a direct result we worked on the United States' most secret projects. Such as weather satellites -- which do more than weather, such as the computers under Cheyenne Mountain, and such as spy satellites. I had two security clearances, one official and one unofficial. The security clearances and all are really beside the point, because most everything I wrote was already written somewhere else. Although I am the author of the Fire From The Sky document, I point out that it is just quotations from others. I was a compiler more than an author. You stated that the writings were channeled through George Green and Doris Ekker from Hatonn (pronouncedd Aton). Well, Green was just a publisher, Doris was the channeler and the channeled material was mostly spiritual. The Battle of the Harvest Moon material did not come from Hatonn, it came from Dr. P. D. Beter who was involved in clandestine activities for MI6 and the Queen of England, he was assigned to the Export/Import Bank by President Kennedy. Beter praticed law before the U.S. Supreme Court, he knew Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General George Brown personally and had secret contacts with Brown. Beter also had contact with extraterrestrials, he was the go-between between Brown and Hatonn. Brown got canned and later murdered because of that contact. Yes, some of the Nazi's escaped and made contacts that lead directly to Ronald Reagan and George Bush. I am sure you know this already. Yes, the astronauts went to the moon - but NASA lied about the whole program and gave us a false story. Check with Richard Hoagland, R.

One of the original plans for the moon program is in the back of the book The Day After Roswell by Philip Curso. I used to get a note every week from a man who was the camera operator for the moon landing hoaxed films. He died a few months ago now so I can't refer you to him. Just do your homework --the year that Gus Grissom, Edgar White and Roger Chaffee (Chaffee was U2 pilot with Frances Gary Powers and pilot that took the pictures that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis. The man who read the pictures and reported to the President is one of my customers, he works for the Texas Department of Transportation, and another of the U2 pilots is a friend of mine who is also my competitor, his business is the same as mine and his shop is across town from me) and a total of 8 astronauts were MURDERED the same year because they resisted the hoax. The rest of the astronauts got the message and went along with the program. You stated \"neither interviewed anyone with first hand knowledge.\" Well, talking about real first hand knowledge can get you suicided. I was first hand and I saw some of what was happening and I just point out to others some of what is going on. In fact, I know more than I tell but no one would even understand it if I told it much less believe it. So it is no different from if I knew nothing -- just do your own homework and I can help you know where to look if you wish. \"Contact was financed primarily through money provided by a wealthy eccentric from Austin, TX.\" Once again, no. Dave Overton the \"wealthy eccentric\" was my friend and customer, he bought the gold from me. When he died, the newspaper interviewed me and then printed a fantasy story that had little to do with the truth. They did not use ANYTHING that I told them, as far as I rememember and could tell.

When Contact Newspaper printed my letters to the man in solitary confinement which became the Fire From the Sky document, even they got some things wrong. One thing that comes to mind, I wrote that the National Reconnaissance Office developed the KH-11 satellite and I said it had a Byeman name Kennan. The proofreaders changed that to \"by a man named Kennan.\" No, it was right exactly as I wrote it, the Byeman names were a method of code nameing. One of the projects that I worked on at Control Data was the KH-11. They also had SI (Special Intelligence) and TK (Talent-Keyhole) codenames, but that is ancient history now. The U2 was Byeman code named Idealist and the SR71 (I did the billing for the SR71 program) was Oxcart. Tony Craddock, researcher and web master for CSETI told me that he has contacts in the NSA, Pentagon, CIA etc. and they all confirmed that everything in the Fire From The Sky document was true. Even the cloning of humans which began in the 1970s. You might contact him and see what he is willing to tell, and while you are at it, consider supporting CSETI, they have given presentations to the United Nations, the Pentagon, all the Chiefs of Staff of the military, etc., trying to break the secrecy seal on the UFO subject. Once the seal is broken, you people are going to be shocked, I can assure you. He is at [http://www.cseti.org](http://www.cseti.org). Best to you and all.

I'm going to be interpreting again for President Bush and President Megawati! This time the meeting will take place in Bali, Indonesia on Wednesday, October 22nd. I invite you to join me in sending energy and prayers for love and opening to these two world leaders as I'm right there beside them. Just last month, many of you participated in creating a small miracle when I was interpreting from English into Indonesian for these two leaders in New York, where they were both speaking at the UN. Literally hundreds of friends joined me in focusing our loving energies at that special meeting. Our invitation for Bush and Megawati to open to more love was so strong that I could feel the room vibrating. I know that on some level everyone present felt and was moved by this loving presence. After this powerful experience, several of you emailed to ask that I give more advance notice if this happens again, so that you might forward the information and invite even more people to join in focusing their love on these leaders as I'm there with them. Well, though I've never before interpreted for the president more than once in a year, I've been asked to do it again only one month later! I invite you to spread the word now so that all who are interested can join us in focusing our energies on reaching the love and the divine spark that lies within the hearts of these world leaders. Let me give you the exact times I will be with Bush and Megawati. Our meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, October 22nd at 3:30 - 6:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time (England), which is 11:30 to 2:00 AM Eastern Time in the US and 8:30 - 11:00PM on *Tuesday night *(the 21st) Pacific Time in the US. We will first have a formal discussion, followed by a working lunch (this will be lunchtime in Bali). Not long afterward, I'll interpret for Bush as he meets with several Indonesian Muslim leaders, though I don't know the exact time for this. In these meetings, it is very likely that Colin Powell and several other top officials will also be present. I first interpreted for a president with Clinton in 1995 through a series of small miracles. I never even tried to become a top interpreter, yet it is very clear that God wanted me to do this work. From that very first time in 1995, what I have done in these meetings whenever I'm not focused on interpreting is to channel divine love to everyone present.

I know that this is the reason this work has been given to me. It was wonderful to channel love on my own at those first meetings, yet eventually I realized how much more powerful it would be to have friends supporting me. So I invited friends to join me in this for the first time when I interpreted for Bush and Megawati in the Oval Office on Sept. 19, 2001, just eight days after 9/11! The second time I invited friends was just last month, when for the first time, I used my email address list to reach many more friends. For this upcoming meeting, I invite you to forward this to any of your friends who might be interested to so that we can have an even larger number of people all focused at the same time on inviting these leaders to open their hearts. Every one of you who chooses to join us strengthens this powerful invitation exponentially. Together, I know we have a huge impact! Just so you know, in these meetings I rarely have any personal communication with those involved other than the pleasantries of hello, thank you, etc. And for anyone who is interested in all of the little miracles that brought me to interpret for presidents, I've written a one-page essay on that inspiring story which you can find at [www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories). Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the very first issue of *Inspirations* for the story \"Little Miracles Lead Me to Interpret for the President.\" It's the second story in that issue. If for whatever reason you can't send energy at the appointed time, I invite you to join us whenever and in whatever way you can. You can take a moment right now to send energy to Bush and to all world leaders that they and we might focus more on what's best for all on this planet, and that they/we invite in more love and harmony around the globe.

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.* ~ Steve Jobs, Apple CEO, in [2005 commencement address](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/12/youve-got-find-love-jobs-says/) at Stanford University **Fluid Intelligence ** Especially in these wild and unpredictable times, it is important to talk about the concept of fluid intelligence in relation to the ability to expand our awareness. **Fluid intelligence has little to do with IQ or \"book\" intelligence. It is rather the ability to step outside of our beliefs and consider information which does not fit into our previously accepted view of reality. ** Our deepest beliefs and conceptions about life and the world are to some degree conditioned by our childhood experiences, our education, the mass media, and various other external influences. An individual's level of fluid intelligence can be determined based on the degree to which he or she is able to let go of previously held conceptions on encountering reliable information or experiences which show these conceptions to be mistaken or overly simplistic. At the other end of the spectrum from fluid intelligence is static intelligence. If an individual is rarely willing to reconsider or challenge their established beliefs, they are said to have a high degree of static intelligence. They aren't much interested in thinking outside of the box. **Science and Fluid Intelligence ** When scientists on the static intelligence end of the spectrum encounter evidence which seriously questions the established paradigm, they attempt to discredit the new information using laws and principles previously agreed upon under the old paradigm. If they fail at this, the new evidence is then deemed not worthy of study and discarded. At worst, the evidence is actively attacked as being irrational or unscientific, even though it may be easily tested and verified. Scientists with a high degree of fluid intelligence who are attracted to study matters outside the current paradigm are often labeled kooks or wacky by those operating with static intelligence. Yet history shows that it is often these \"kooky\" scientists who go on to make the most [astonishing discoveries](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/russell_peter_paradigm_shift2) which pave the way for entire new areas of study which were once considered nonsense. Einstein, Galileo, and Pasteur were all ridiculed by many respected scientists of their day for their amazing discoveries which ushered in entire new branches of knowledge. **All of us are at times resistant to letting go of old beliefs, while at other times we are excited to explore new ways of thinking and being. **Static intelligence and fluid intelligence are two ends of a continuum, and each of us shifts to varying points on that continuum over time.

The many pioneers of [quantum physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics) who are finding that for deeper understanding of our world, it may be impossible to separate the physical world from consciousness. **Two classics which challenge static scientific paradigms using reliable, verifiable research from hundreds of scientific studies are the books *[The Holographic Universe](http://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Michael-Talbot/dp/0586091718?tag=wanttinfo-20)* by Michael Talbot and *[The Field](http://www.amazon.com/Field-Quest-Secret-Force-Universe/dp/0060931175?tag=wanttinfo-20)* by Lynne McTaggart.** The paradigm-busting film *[What the Bleep!?](https://www.amazon.com/What-Bleep-Do-We-Know/dp/B0006UEVQ8)* covers similar territory in a less scientific, yet very fun way, as does the inspiring movie [*I Am*](http://www.amazon.com/I-AM-Tom-Shadyac/dp/B005U0ZP46/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1333422949&sr=1-1).

This can be a valuable opportunity for you to examine your viewpoint and use fluid intelligence to revise and expand your beliefs. Please understand that those involved with presenting this material have no desire to make you believe anything. Yet we are interested in challenging all of us to open to more expanded levels of belief and experience in all aspects of our lives. The entire [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) website and [Insight Course](https://www.insightcourse.net/) provide an abundance of rich material which challenges us to explore more expansive and integrated ways of living together through stretching beyond our old beliefs and conceptions. They invite us to explore reliable, verifiable information which suggests that the commonly held view of the way things work in the world may be overly simplistic and distorted. We are also encouraged to move toward less secrecy and greater transparency as we work together to support what's best for all who share our world. **Transparency and Levels of Consciousness** There are many levels of consciousness within each one of us. **It is not uncommon for us to have beliefs or knowledge **at one level ** of consciousness which are in direct opposition to that of another level.** On one level we may know, as Galileo once contended, that the Earth is the third planet from the sun. We also know that our solar system is located in one arm of a spiral galaxy [far from its center](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10385928), which is far from the location of the Big Bang which allegedly formed the universe. Yet on another level, the Earth is for us in our daily lives the very center of our universe, as the church once argued against Galileo. On an expanded level of consciousness, we may believe that humanity is meant to find ways to let go of anger and to live in peace and harmony with each other. Yet on a more contracted level, we may individually feel fully justified in being quite angry and upset at someone", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:fluidintelligence.txt:2:946cd44654a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9905, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "fluidintelligence.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "fluidintelligence", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "formed the universe. Yet on another level, the Earth is for us in our daily lives the very center of our universe, as the church once argued against Galileo. On an expanded level of consciousness, we may believe that humanity is meant to find ways to let go of anger and to live in peace and harmony with each other. Yet on a more contracted level, we may individually feel fully justified in being quite angry and upset at someone in our family or at some politician or powerful group. Something that very much makes sense on one level may appear quite \"illogical\" on another. Though our minds might like to convince us otherwise, most of us walk through life with many contradictions within our consciousness. By choosing to be transparent, the inconsistencies within us and in the world become increasingly apparent, thus allowing us greater choice in how we deal with them. We naturally become more open and better able to understand and integrate conflicting beliefs on various levels. Through choosing to identify, understand, and transform the inconsistencies within ourselves, they can actually become potent teachers inviting us to expand our awareness, if we allow them to. **Beliefs and Reality ** **The more coherently we believe something on all levels of consciousness, the more the universe tends to shape itself around those beliefs.** The more deeply we know something to be true, the more likely we will see and experience the world in terms of that truth. Yet this does not necessarily mean that what is true for one person, no matter how deeply it is experienced, will be true for others. Each person - through their interpretation of what happens to them throughout life - develops their own version of reality, which has varying amounts of overlap with what others believe to be reality. We may live in the same physical world, yet our beliefs about what is true and real, and our emotional experience of this world can be quite different. Some individuals have a greater ability to influence the beliefs of those around them than others. Those who have a very strong, coherent energy field that is directed outwards generally appear dynamic and charismatic to others. They are thus more easily able to convince those around them of what they believe or know to be true. They are often considered to be great communicators and influential people. This does not necessarily mean, however, that they know \"The Truth.\" On the other hand, a more \"shy\" person or one who keeps their energy more contained or directed inward may have a level of knowingness just as strong as an outgoing charismatic person, but because of their shyness or inwardness, they are much less likely (or may not even want) to persuade others to believe as they do. **There is no ultimate right or wrong here.

Whether we choose to direct our energy more outward or inward, each of us is doing what we believe to be right in each moment. ** **The more transparent we are to ourselves and to the world around us, the more consciously we can make choices.

O-n Monday, June 21, a producer from Fox News's *The O'Reilly Factor* called to ask me to appear as a guest that evening to comment o-n a front-page story in the *New York Times* claiming that the Bush Administration had overstated the value of intelligence gained at Guantanamo and the dangers posed by the men detained there. I'm generally not a fan of shout-television, and I had declined several prior invitations to appear o-n O'Reilly's show, but this time I said yes. Little did I know it would not o-nly be my first time, but also my last. I sat in the Washington studio as the taping of the show began in New York with a rant from Bill O'Reilly. He claimed that \"the *Factor*\" had established the link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, and then played a clip from Thomas Kean, head of the Senate's 9/11 Commission, in which Kean said, \"There is no evidence that we can find whatsoever that Iraq or Saddam Hussein participated in any way in attacks o-n the United States, in other words, o-n 9/11. What we do say, however, is there were contacts between Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Iraq, Saddam--excuse me. Al Qaeda.\" I was impressed. O'Reilly, who had announced his show as the \"No Spin Zone,\" was actually playing a balanced soundbite, o-ne that accurately reported the commission's findings both that there was no evidence linking Saddam and 9/11, and that there was some evidence of contacts (if no \"collaborative relationship\") between Saddam and Al Qaeda. Maybe all those nasty things Al Franken had said about O'Reilly weren't true after all. But suddenly O'Reilly interrupted, plainly angry, and said, \"We can't use that.... We need to redo the whole thing.\" Three minutes of silence later, the show began again, with O'Reilly re-recording the introduction verbatim. Except this time, when he got to the part about Kean, he played no tape, and simply paraphrased Kean as confirming that \"definitely there was a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda.\" The part about no link to 9/11 was left o-n the cutting-room floor. Now it was my turn. O'Reilly introduced the segment by complaining that we are at war and need to be united, but that newspapers like the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:foxtvdistortsiraqinfo.txt:0:9056c2bfe2e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9910, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "foxtvdistortsiraqinfo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "foxtvdistortsiraqinfo", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "show began again, with O'Reilly re-recording the introduction verbatim.

Now it was my turn. O'Reilly introduced the segment by complaining that we are at war and need to be united, but that newspapers like the *New York Times* are running biased stories, dividing the country and aiding the enemy. \"The spin must stop--our lives depend o-n it,\" O'Reilly gravely intoned. He then characterized the *Times* story that day as claiming that the Guantanamo detainees were \"innocent people\" and \"harmless.\" He said the paper's article \"questions holding the detainees at Guantanamo.\" I noted that the *Times* had said nothing of the sort. And I pointed out that the article relied o-n a CIA study finding that the detainees seemed to be low-level and had provided little valuable intelligence. That didn't convince O'Reilly, however, who again criticized the *Times* for misleading its readers by terming the detainees innocent and not dangerous. I replied that he was misleading his own viewers, by exaggerating what the *Times* had said. \"No, I'm not,\" he retorted. So far, the usual fare o-n newstalk television. But then I decided to go o-ne step further: \"It seems to me like the pot calling the kettle black, Bill, because I just sat here five minutes ago as you re-recorded the introduction to this show to take out a statement from the head of the 9/11 commission stating that there was no evidence of a link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11.\" Apparently O'Reilly does not like being called \"the pot.\" He exploded, repeatedly called me an \"S.O.B.\" and assured me that he would cut my accusation from the interview when the show aired. He also said I would \"never ever\" be o-n his show again. At this point, I wasn't sure whether to take that as a threat or a promise. Sure enough, when *The O'Reilly Factor* aired later that night, both Thomas Kean's statement about 9/11 and my charge about O'Reilly deleting it were missing. All that was left was Bill O'Reilly, fuming at the liberal media's lack of objectivity and balance, and ruing the divisive effect \"spin\" has o-n our national unity.

For those who don't know, **I served as an interpreter in the Indonesian language for Presidents G.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Vice Presidents Al Gore and Dick Cheney, Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeline Albright, and many other top officials over the years in my work with the State Department**. The secrecy clause of the contract I refused to sign states interpreters \"shall not communicate to any person or organization *any information* known to them by reason of their performance of services that has not been made public,\" unless written approval is obtained from our superiors. And this applies *for the rest of our lives. * This means that if my itinerary has not been made public, I can't even tell my friends and family in what city and hotel I'm staying while I'm away. It means that if someone tells me a good joke while I'm working, I can never tell it to anyone unless it somehow is made public. It means that even if I have heart-warming, inspiring experiences with my visitors (which I've had many), I would not be able to share them without written approval.** I certainly understand the need for secrecy related to national security, but this level of secrecy is ridiculous.** This new contract sadly reflects the rampant secrecy which has been growing over recent years in government. Realizing that because of this growing trend my resignation might be of interest to the media, I sent an email to my press contacts, and received some good coverage. **You can read an article on my resignation on the *Washington Post* website on [this webpage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49449-2004Dec8.html).** If you cannot access the article at that link, I've downloaded the article on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresignspost).

While everyone's bodies are in reality held in pods still and unmoving, enslaved by this master computer which feeds upon their energy, their brains are busy experiencing what is perceived to be a completely normal life. The minds of these unmoving captives are responding to and living out a highly sophisticated computer program run and controlled by the Matrix. A few brave people in the movie take the \"red pill\" and manage to escape this computer-generated reality to do battle with this all-powerful machine. Below is something that recently came to me about this movie while I was on a beautiful run up in the hills near my home. **Transforming the Matrix** You remember the movie \"The Matrix\"? Well, guess what. We do live in the Matrix. It is a matrix constructed of our own fears, both individual and collective. Acknowledging and exploring the roots of the matrix, the roots of the fears inside of ourselves and others, frees us from this controlling matrix and allows us to more consciously create our reality. By opening to [acceptance and understanding](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance) of all parts of ourselves and others, both the fear and the love, the light and the dark, we can transform the matrix. We can transform our fears into a web of interconnection made of our love, both individual and collective. By choosing to recognize fear as an [invitation to growth](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue), we can powerfully co-create a new paradigm of love and cooperation on Earth. We can transform the Matrix into a [web of love and interconnectedness.](https://www.weboflove.org) **Fascinating Intelligence Information** Along the lines of this matrix and the potential for transformation, I recently received an email confirming something I had suspected for quite a while.

In my research of the [major cover-ups](https://www.WantToKnow.info) going on in the world, I've found that intelligence agencies around the world play a decisive role in political and economic developments through their secret manipulations and a wide variety of clandestine operations. **As in any organization, some of the agents in these intelligence agencies are acting largely out of selfish or deluded motives, while others are truly doing what they believe to be best for their respective countries. ** Over many decades, the self-serving intelligence agents have often succeeded in [manipulating the unsuspecting public into unnecessary wars](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) and a variety of other activities that benefit the power elite at the expense of those below them in the power hierarchy. Yet other intelligence agents who are deeply committed to serving their respective countries have witnessed these self-serving manipulations by their colleagues over the years and have done what they could to prevent them. **If the email I recently received is correct, a small, but powerful group of influential intelligence agents in service of the greater good from around the world long ago formed a group called the Library.** Over many decades, members of the Library have collected and archived key information on all of the secret manipulations committed by the self-serving group and the resulting effects on global politics and economics. When the self-serving group occasionally gets out of control, Library members leak certain information to the appropriate sources to prevent some really ugly things from happening. The email I received relayed information from someone calling himself \"the German guy,\" who claimed to be a member of the Library. His communication was designed to prevent a purported major attack on Dec. 27th. I chose not to send this email out before the 27th, as the information was not from a reliable source, and I didn't want to induce fear. I was also fairly certain that the attack he mentioned would be averted, as I know his information got into the hands of the people who could do something about it.

He had to quit after refusing to sign a new secrecy agreement that would have barred him from ever mentioning anything about his work to anyone for the rest of his life. \"I'm not saying there shouldn't be secrecy -- it's obvious we need secrecy in certain areas,\" he said, adding he'd have no problem agreeing to keep secret \"anything that could conceivably compromise national security. That, I would've been willing to sign.\" The contract the State Department demanded, however, could have kept him from ever telling anyone where he was going, whom he was with, any jokes or quips he overheard, even anything illegal he might witness. \"The contractor ... shall not communicate to any person or organization any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this agreement that has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the contracting officer,\" the contract says. \"These obligations do not cease upon the expiration or termination of this agreement.\" That's too broad, Burks said. \"To me it's a perfect symptom of the direction things are going with secrecy.\" State Department spokesman Kurtis Cooper said the language is \"basically boilerplate\" and hasn't caused much of a row among most workers. Secrecy agreements seem to be proliferating in the nation's capital. Labor unions recently complained that the Department of Homeland Security has demanded that its employees and contractors sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from sharing \"sensitive but unclassified information\" -- a gag order requiring workers to submit to potentially intrusive searches. Some might be surprised Burks never before had been sworn to secrecy, but professional interpreters generally keep what they hear to themselves. For example, Article 2, Section A of the Code of Ethics of the Switzerland-based International Association of Conference Interpreters -- of which Burks isn't a member -- says members \"shall be bound by the strictest secrecy, which must be observed towards all persons and with regard to all information disclosed in the course of the practice of the profession at any gathering not open to the public.\" Burks, 46, is a gangly and enthusiastic New Jersey native who moved to the Bay Area at age 13 and has lived here, when not abroad, since then.

He began interpreting for the government in 1986, soon after returning from two years in China. He did some Mandarin Chinese work at first, but found it easier to keep up with diplomatic terms in Bahasa Indonesia, the national language of Indonesia, which he'd learned while living there in 1981. Most of his early work was on low-level diplomatic and political missions, but there were only a few qualified Indonesian interpreters available, and he rose through the ranks quickly. By 1995 he was in a White House meeting between President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Indonesian President Suharto and others. In 2001 -- one week after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks -- he was in the Oval Office with President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Indonesian President Megawati, cabinet members and others. He carried no secret security clearance through these and dozens of other major jobs, \"which to me is a major mistake,\" he said. He sometimes was advised to apply for secret clearance, but the series of extensive background checks was never required of him. And although the more stringent secrecy demand first was given to him during the Clinton administration's last days in October 2000, he never signed it, and nothing further was said of it. Only this fall, as the demand was incorporated into a whole new contract, did it become a sticking point. The secrecy language is being presented to all of the State Department's approximately 1,600 part-time interpreters, so Burks doesn't believe he's being singled out. Nor does he believe the demand has anything to do with his burgeoning work as an \"armchair investigative journalist.\" He founded [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) (\"Revealing Major Cover-ups & Working Together for a Better World\") in October 2002, gathering information from official documents and major media on subjects from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to government mind-control research. He now has taken up this work full-time, quitting his part-time nursing work and living off his savings. Only once has anything from his interpreting work become part of his amateur journalism. After President Bush's \"let me finish\" comment during one of the October debates led some people to speculate he was being fed information through a hidden earpiece, Burks sent his site's subscribers an account of the 2001 meeting between Bush and Megawati. Burks reported he had been amazed at the president's uncharacteristically long and detailed discourse on Indonesian affairs and since had come to believe the president was being electronically coached.

So citizens who wished to give voice to their many grievances with the Powers That Be had to: (1) Schedule their exercise of First Amendment rights with the decidedly unsympathetic authorities. (2) Report like cattle to the protest pen at their designated time, and only in the numbers authorized. (3) Then, under the recorded surveillance of the authorities, feel free to let loose with all the speech they could utter within their allotted minutes (although no one--not Bush, not convention delegates, not the preening members of Congress, not the limousine-gliding corporate sponsors and certainly not the mass media--would be anywhere nearby to hear a single word of what they had to say). Imagine how proud the Founders would be of this interpretation of their revolutionary work. The Democrats, always willing to learn useful tricks from the opposition, created their own \"free-speech zone\" when they gathered in Los Angeles that year for their convention. Once ensconced in the White House, the Bushites institutionalized the art of dissing dissent, routinely dispatching the Secret Service to order local police to set up FSZs to quarantine protesters wherever Bush goes. The embedded media trooping dutifully behind him almost never cover this fascinating and truly newsworthy phenomenon, instead focusing almost entirely on spoon-fed soundbites from the President's press office. An independent libertarian writer, however, James Bovard, chronicled George's splendid isolation from citizen protest in last December's issue of *The American Conservative* ([www.amconmag.com](http://www.amconmag.com)). He wrote about Bill Neel, a retired steelworker who dared to raise his humble head at a 2002 Labor Day picnic in Pittsburgh, where Bush had gone to be photographed with worker-type people. Bill definitely did not fit the message of the day, for this 65-year-old was sporting a sign that said: The Bush Family Must Surely Love the Poor, They Made so Many of Us. Ouch! Negative! Not acceptable! Must go! Bill was standing in a crowd of pro-Bush people who were standing along the street where Bush's motorcade would pass. The Bush backers had all sorts of Hooray George-type signs. Those were totally okey-dokey with the Secret Service, but Neel's...well, it simply had to be removed. He was told by the Pittsburgh cops to depart to the designated FSZ, a ballpark encased in a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freedomofspeech.txt:0:0345b0fc47c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9921, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freedomofspeech.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freedomofspeech", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Surely Love the Poor, They Made so Many of Us.

The Bush backers had all sorts of Hooray George-type signs. Those were totally okey-dokey with the Secret Service, but Neel's...well, it simply had to be removed. He was told by the Pittsburgh cops to depart to the designated FSZ, a ballpark encased in a chain-link fence a third of a mile from Bush's (and the media's) path. Bill, that rambunctious rebel, refused to budge. So they arrested him for disorderly conduct, dispatched him to the luxury of a Pittsburgh jail and confiscated his offending sign. At Bill's trial, a Pittsburgh detective testified that the Secret Service had instructed local police to confine \"people that were making a statement pretty much against the President and his views.\" The district court judge not only tossed out the silly charges against Neel but scolded the prosecution: \"I believe this is America. Whatever happened to 'I don't agree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it'?\" This was no isolated incident. Bovard also takes us to St. Louis, where George appeared last year. About 150 sign-toting protesters were shunted off to a zone where they could not be seen from the street, and--get ready to spin in your grave, Jimmy Madison--the media were *not allowed* to talk to them, and protesters were* not allowed* out of the protest zone to talk to the media. Now meet Brett Bursey. He committed the crime of holding up a No War for Oil sign when sensitive George visited Columbia, South Carolina, last year. Standing amid a sea of pro-Bush signs in a public area, Bursey was commanded by local police to remove himself forthwith to the FSZ half a mile away from the action, even though he was already two football fields from where Bush was to speak. No, said Brett. So, naturally, they arrested him. Asked why, the officer said, \"It's the content of your sign that's the problem.\" Five months later, Brett's trespassing charge was tossed on the rather obvious grounds that--yoo-hoo!--there's no such thing as a member of the public trespassing on public property at a public event. But John Ashcroft is oblivious to the obvious, so the Justice Department of the United States of America (represented in this case by--can you stand it?--US Attorney Strom Thurmond Jr.) inserted itself into this local misdemeanor case, charging our man Brett with a *federal* violation of \"entering a restricted area around the president.\" Great Goofy in the Sky--he was 200 yards away, surrounded by cheering Bushcalytes who were also in the \"restricted area.\" Ashcroft/Thurmond/Bush attempted to deny Bursey's lawyers access to Secret Service documents setting forth official policy on who gets stopped for criticizing the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freedomofspeech.txt:1:e06a62c55c3e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9922, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freedomofspeech.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freedomofspeech", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "States of America (represented in this case by--can you stand it?--US Attorney Strom Thurmond Jr.) inserted itself into this local misdemeanor case, charging our man Brett with a *federal* violation of \"entering a restricted area around the president.\" Great Goofy in the Sky--he was 200 yards away, surrounded by cheering Bushcalytes who were also in the \"restricted area.\" Ashcroft/Thurmond/Bush attempted to deny Bursey's lawyers access to Secret Service documents setting forth official policy on who gets stopped for criticizing the President, where, when and why. But Bursey finally obtained the documents and posted them on the South Carolina Progressive Network website, [www.scpronet.com](http://www.scpronet.com); they reveal that what the Secret Service did goes against official policy. Then there's the \"Crawford Contretemps.\" In May of 2003 a troupe of about 100 antiwar Texans were on their way by car to George W's Little Ponderosa, located about five miles outside the tiny town of Crawford. To get to Bush's place, one drives through the town--but the traveling protesters were greeted by a police blockade. They got out of their cars to find out what was up, only to be told by Police Chief Donnie Tidmore that they were violating a town ordinance requiring a permit to protest within the city limits. But wait, they said, we're on our way to Bush's ranchette--we have no intention of protesting here. Logic was a stranger that day in Crawford, however, and Chief Tidmore warned them that they had three minutes to turn around and go back from whence they came, or else they'd be considered a demonstration, and, he reminded them, they had no permit for that. (Tidmore later said that he actually gave them seven minutes to depart, in order to be \"as fair as possible.\") Five of the group tried to talk sense with Tidmore, but that was not possible. Their reward for even trying was to be arrested for refusing to disperse and given a night in the nearby McLennan County jail. The chief said he could've just given them a ticket, but he judged that arresting them was the only way to get them to move, claiming that they were causing a danger because of the traffic. This February, the five were brought to trial in Crawford. Their lawyer asked Tidmore if someone who simply wore a political button reading \"Peace\" could be found in violation of Crawford's ordinance against protesting without a permit. Yes, said the chief. \"It could be a sign of demonstration.\" The five were convicted. The Bushites are using federal, state and local police to conduct an undeclared war against dissent, literally incarcerating Americans who publicly express their disagreements with him and his policies. The ACLU and others have now sued Bush's Secret Service for its ongoing pattern of repressing legitimate, made-in-America protest, citing cases in Arizona, California, Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas--and coming soon to a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freedomofspeech.txt:2:6a8670bfa950", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9923, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freedomofspeech.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freedomofspeech", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "permit.

The ACLU and others have now sued Bush's Secret Service for its ongoing pattern of repressing legitimate, made-in-America protest, citing cases in Arizona, California, Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas--and coming soon to a theater near you! If incarceration is not enough to deter dissenters, how about some old-fashioned goon-squad tactics like infiltration and intimidation of protesters? In May of 2002 Ashcroft issued a decree terminating a quarter-century-old policy that bans FBI agents from spying on Americans in their political meetings and churches. Not only were federal agents \"freed\" by Bush and his attack dog Ashcroft to violate the freedoms (assembly, speech, privacy) of any and all citizens, but they were encouraged to do so. This unleashing of the FBI was done in the name of combating foreign terrorists. Likewise, in May of last year, the Homeland Security Department waded butt-deep into the murky waters of political suppression, issuing a terrorist advisory to local law enforcement agencies. It urged all police officials to keep a hawk-eyed watch on any homelanders who have \"expressed dislike of attitudes and decisions of the US government.\" With the FBI on the loose, other police powers now feel free to join in the all-season sport of intimidating people. In Austin, even the Army was caught snooping on us. At a small University of Texas conference in February to discuss Islam in Muslim countries, two Army officers were discovered to be posing as participants. The next week two agents from the Army Intelligence and Security Command appeared on campus demanding a list of participants and trying to grill Sahar Aziz, the conference organizer. Alarmed by these intimidating tactics, Aziz got the help of a lawyer, and the local newspaper ran a story. The Army quickly went away--but a spokeswoman for the intelligence command refused even to confirm that the agents had been on campus, much less discuss why the US Army is involved in domestic surveillance and intimidation. In California an antiwar group called Peace Fresno included in its ranks a nice young man named Aaron Stokes, who was always willing to be helpful. Unfortunately, Aaron died in a motorcycle wreck, and when his picture ran in the paper, Peace Fresno learned that he was really Aaron Kilner, a deputy with the sheriff's department. The sheriff said he could not discuss the specifics of Kilner's infiltration role, but that there was no formal investigation of Peace Fresno under way. He did insist, however, that there is potential for terrorism in Fresno County. \"We believe that there is,\" the sheriff said ominously (and vaguely). \"I'm not going to expand on it.\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freedomofspeech.txt:3:a29b9f26982f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9924, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freedomofspeech.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freedomofspeech", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "wreck, and when his picture ran in the paper, Peace Fresno learned that he was really Aaron Kilner, a deputy with the sheriff's department.

He did insist, however, that there is potential for terrorism in Fresno County. \"We believe that there is,\" the sheriff said ominously (and vaguely). \"I'm not going to expand on it.\" If the authorities think there is terrorist potential in Fresno (probably not real high on Osama's target list), then there is potential everywhere, and under the Bush regime, this is plenty enough reason for any and all police agencies to launch secret campaigns to infiltrate, investigate and intimidate any and all people and groups with politics that they find even mildly suspicious...or distasteful. The attitude of police authorities was summed up by Mike van Winkle, a spokesperson for the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center (another spinoff of the Homeland Security Department--your tax dollars at work). After peaceful antiwar protesters in Oakland were gassed and shot by local police, van Winkle [**Note:** I do not make up these names] explained the prevailing thinking of America's new, vast network of antiterrorist forces: *You can make an easy kind of link that, if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that's being fought against is international terrorism, you might have terrorism at that protest. You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act. I've heard terrorism described as anything that is violent or has an economic impact. Terrorism isn't just bombs going off and killing people.* Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Incredible discoveries about the nature of electricity were becoming common place. [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) was demonstrating \"[wireless lighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower)\" and other wonders associated with high frequency currents. There was an excitement about the future like never before. Within 20 years, there would be automobiles, airplanes, movies, recorded music, telephones, radio, and practical cameras. The Victorian Age was giving way to something totally new. For the first time in history, common people were encouraged to envision a utopian future filled with abundant modern transportation and communication, as well as jobs, housing and food for everyone. Disease would be conquered, and so would poverty. Life was getting better, and this time, everyone was going to get a piece of the pie. So, what happened? In the midst of this technological explosion, where did the energy breakthroughs go? Was all of this excitement about free energy, which happened just before the beginning of the last century, just wishful thinking that \"real science\" eventually disproved? **Current State of Technology** Actually, the answer to that question is no. In fact, the opposite is true. **Spectacular energy technologies were developed right along with the other breakthroughs. Since that time, [multiple methods](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergyinventionsnewsarticles) for producing vast amounts of energy at extremely low cost have been developed. None of these technologies have made it to the consumer market as an article of commerce, however**. Exactly why this is true will be discussed shortly. But first, I would like to describe to you a short list of free energy technologies that I am currently aware of, and that are proven beyond all reasonable doubt. **The common feature connecting all of these discoveries, is that they use a small amount of one form of energy to control or release a large amount of a different kind of energy. **Many of them tap the underlying aether field in some way; a source of energy conveniently ignored by modern science. 1) **[**Radiant Energy**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/radiantenergy).** Nikola Tesla's [magnifying transmitter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nikolateslamagnifyingtransmitter), T. Henry Moray's [radiant energy device](http://www.rexresearch.com/moray2/morayrer.htm), Edwin Gray's [EMA motor](http://www.rexresearch.com/evgray/1gray.htm), and Paul Baumann's [Testatika machine](http://www.rexresearch.com/testatik/testart.htm) all run on radiant energy. This natural energy form can be gathered directly from the environment (mistakenly called \"static\" electricity) or extracted from ordinary electricity by the method called [fractionation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation). Radiant energy can perform the same wonders as ordinary electricity, at less than 1% of the cost. It does not behave exactly like electricity, however, which has contributed to the scientific community's misunderstanding of it. The Methernitha Community in Switzerland currently has 5 or 6 [working models](https://www.WantToKnow.info/methernitatestatika) of fuelless, self-running devices that tap this energy. 2) **[**Permanent Magnets**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/permanentmagnets)**.

[Dr. Robert Adams](http://web.archive.org/web/20071114200005/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/1287/adams/adamsall.htm) (NZ) has developed astounding designs of electric motors, generators and heaters that run on permanent magnets. One such device draws 100 watts of electricity from the source, generates 100 watts to recharge the source, and produces over 140 BTU's of heat in two minutes! [Dr. Tom Bearden](https://www.WantToKnow.info/beardenmeg) (USA) has two working models of a permanent magnet powered electrical transformer. It uses a 6-watt electrical input to control the path of a magnetic field coming out of a permanent magnet. By channeling the magnetic field, first to one output coil and then a second output coil, and by doing this repeatedly and rapidly in a \"ping-pong\" fashion, the device can produce a 96-watt electrical output with no moving parts. Bearden calls his device a Motionless Electromagnetic Generator, or MEG. [Jean-Louis Naudin](http://jnaudin.free.fr/) has duplicated Bearden's device in France. The principles for this type of device were first disclosed by Frank Richardson (USA) in 1978. [Troy Reed](http://mlpoi.com/marsmission/marsbull/bull326.htm) (USA) has working models of a special magnetized fan that heats up as it spins. It takes exactly the same amount of energy to spin the fan whether it is generating heat or not. Beyond these developments, multiple inventors have identified working mechanisms that produce motor torque from permanent magnets alone. 3) **[Mechanical Heaters](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mechanicalheaters)**. There are two classes of machines that transform a small amount of mechanical energy into a large amount of heat. The best of these purely mechanical designs are the rotating cylinder systems designed by [Frenette (USA) and Perkins (USA)](http://www.rexresearch.com/frenette/frenette.htm). In these machines, one cylinder is rotated within another cylinder with about an eighth of an inch of clearance between them. The space between the cylinders is filled with a liquid such as water or oil, and it is this \"working fluid\" that heats up as the inner cylinder spins. Another method uses magnets mounted on a wheel to produce large eddy currents in a plate of aluminum, causing the aluminum to heat up rapidly. These magnetic heaters have been demonstrated by Muller (Canada), Adams (NZ) and Reed (USA). All of these systems can produce ten times more heat than standard methods using the same energy input. 4) **[Super-Efficient Electrolysis](http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Electrolysis)**.

Water can be broken into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. Standard chemistry books claim that this process requires more energy than can be recovered when the gases are recombined. This is true only under the worst case scenario. When water is hit with its own molecular resonant frequency, using a system developed by [Stan Meyers](http://waterpoweredcar.com/stanmeyer.html) (USA) and again recently by [Xogen Power](http://web.archive.org/web/20040123231850/http://www.xogen.ca/), Inc., it collapses into hydrogen and oxygen gas with very little electrical input. Also, using different electrolytes (additives that make the water conduct electricity better) changes the efficiency of the process dramatically. It is also known that certain geometric structures and surface textures work better than others do. The implication is that unlimited amounts of hydrogen fuel can be made to drive engines ([like in your car](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/energy/water_car_stanley_meyers)) for the cost of water. Even more amazing is the fact that a special metal alloy was patented by [Freedman](#patents) (USA) in 1957 that spontaneously breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen with no outside electrical input and without causing any chemical changes in the metal itself. This means that this special metal alloy can make hydrogen from water for free, forever. 5) **[Implosion/Vortex](http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Vortex_Technologies)**. All major industrial engines use the release of heat to cause expansion and pressure to produce work, like in your car engine. Nature uses the opposite process of cooling to cause suction and vacuum to produce work, like in a tornado. [Viktor Schauberger](http://www.rexresearch.com/schaub/schaub.htm) (Austria) was the first to build working models of implosion engines in the 1930's and 1940's. Since that time, Callum Coats has published extensively on Schauberger's work in his book *[Living Energies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0717133079/qid=1148783601/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2630229-1437730?tag=wanttinfo-20&s=books&v=glance&n=283155)* and subsequently, a number of researchers have built working models of implosion turbine engines. These are fuelless engines that produce mechanical work from energy accessed from a vacuum. There are also much simpler designs that use vortex motions to tap a combination of gravity and centrifugal force to produce a continuous motion in fluids. 6) **[**Cold Fusion**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/energy/cold_fusion_reactor)**. In March 1989, [two chemists](https://web.archive.org/web/20060517164206/http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?ID=118) from the University of Utah (USA) announced that they had produced atomic fusion reactions in a simple tabletop device. The claims were \"debunked\" within six months and the public lost interest. Nevertheless, cold fusion is very real. Not only has excess heat production been [repeatedly documented](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#cold), but also low energy atomic element transmutation has been catalogued, involving dozens of different reactions! This technology definitely can produce low cost energy and scores of other important industrial processes.

[See [CBS news article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cold-fusion-is-hot-again/) on resurgence of cold fusion] 7) **[Solar Assisted Heat Pumps](https://www.WantToKnow.info/heatpumps)**. The refrigerator in your kitchen is the only free energy machine you currently own. It's an electrically operated heat pump. It uses one amount of energy (electricity) to move three amounts of energy (heat). This gives it a co-efficient of performance (COP) of about 3. Your refrigerator uses one amount of electricity to pump three amounts of heat from the inside of the refrigerator to the outside of the refrigerator. This is its typical use, but it is the worst possible way to use the technology. Here's why. A heat pump pumps heat from the source of heat to the \"sink\" or place that absorbs the heat. The source of heat should obviously be hot and the sink for heat should obviously be cold for this process to work the best. In your refrigerator, it's exactly the opposite. The source of heat is inside the box, which is cold, and the sink for heat is the room temperature air of your kitchen, which is warmer than the source. This is why the COP remains low for your kitchen refrigerator. But this is not true for all heat pumps. COP's of 8 to 10 are easily attained with solar assisted heat pumps. In such a device, a heat pump draws heat from a solar collector and dumps the heat into a large underground absorber, which remains at 55° F, and mechanical energy is extracted in the transfer. This process is equivalent to a steam engine that extracts mechanical energy between the boiler and the condenser, except that it uses a fluid that boils at a much lower temperature than water. One such system that was tested in the 1970's produced 350 hp, measured on a Dynamometer, in a specially designed engine from just 100-sq. ft. of solar collector. (This is not the system promoted by [Dennis Lee](#lee).) The amount of energy it took to run the compressor (input) was less than 20 hp, so this system produced more than 17 times more energy than it took to keep it going! It could power a small neighborhood from the roof of a hot tub gazebo, using exactly the same technology that keeps the food cold in your kitchen. Currently, there is an [industrial scale heat pump system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion) just north of Kona, Hawaii that generates electricity from temperature differences in ocean water. There are dozens of other systems that I have not mentioned, many of them are as viable and well tested as the ones I have just recounted.

There are dozens of other systems that I have not mentioned, many of them are as viable and well tested as the ones I have just recounted. But this short list is sufficient to make my point: free energy technology is here, now. It offers the world pollution-free, energy abundance for everyone, everywhere. It is now possible to stop the production of greenhouse gases and shut down all of the nuclear power plants. We can now desalinate unlimited amounts of seawater at an affordable price, and bring adequate fresh water to even the most remote habitats. Transportation costs and the production costs for just about everything can drop dramatically. Food can even be grown in heated greenhouses in the winter, anywhere. All of these wonderful benefits that can make life on this planet so much easier and better for everyone have been postponed for decades. Why? Whose purposes are served by this postponement? **Four Invisible Forces ** **There are four gigantic forces that have worked together to create this situation.** To say that there is and has been a conspiracy to suppress this technology only leads to a superficial understanding of the world, and it places the blame for this completely outside of ourselves. Our willingness to remain ignorant and actionless in the face of this situation has always been interpreted by two of these forces as implied consent. So, besides a non-demanding public, what are the other forces that are impeding the availability of free energy technology? In the United States, and in most other countries around the world, there is a money monopoly in place. I am free to earn as much money as I want, but I will only be paid in Federal Reserve Notes. There is nothing I can do to be paid in Gold Certificates, or some other form of money. This money monopoly is solely in the hands of a small number of private stock banks, and these banks are owned by the wealthiest families in the world. Their plan is to eventually control 100% of all of the capital resources of the world, and thereby control everyone's life through the availability (or non-availability) of all goods and services. **An independent source of wealth (free energy device) in the hands of each and every person in the world, ruins the plans of the wealthiest families for world domination, permanently.** Why this is true is easy to see. Currently, a nation's economy can be either slowed down or sped up by the raising or lowering of interest rates. But if an independent source of capital (energy) were present in the economy, and any business or person", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freeenergy.txt:4:c1e8c416b818", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9930, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freeenergy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freeenergy", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "all goods and services. **An independent source of wealth (free energy device) in the hands of each and every person in the world, ruins the plans of the wealthiest families for world domination, permanently.** Why this is true is easy to see. Currently, a nation's economy can be either slowed down or sped up by the raising or lowering of interest rates. But if an independent source of capital (energy) were present in the economy, and any business or person could raise more capital without borrowing it from a bank, this centralized throttling action on interest rates would simply not have the same effect. Free energy technology changes the value of money. The wealthiest families and the issuers of credit do not want any competition. It's that simple. They want to maintain their current monopoly control of the money supply. For them, free energy technology is not just something to suppress, it must be permanently forbidden! **So, the wealthiest families and their central banking institutions are the first force operating to postpone the public availability of free energy technology. Their motivations are the imagined divine right to rule, greed, and their insatiable need to control almost everything except themselves.** The weapons they have used to enforce this postponement include intimidation, \"expert\" debunkers, buying and shelving of technology, murder and attempted murder of the inventors, character assassination, arson, and a wide variety of financial incentives and disincentives to manipulate possible supporters. They have also promoted the general acceptance of a scientific theory that states that free energy is impossible (laws of thermodynamics). **The second force operating to postpone the public availability of free energy technology is national governments. The problem here is not so much related to competition in the printing of currency, but in the maintenance of national security.** The fact is, the world out there is a jungle, and humans can be counted upon to be very cruel, dishonest, and sneaky. It is government's job to provide for the common defense. For this, police powers are delegated by the executive branch of government to enforce \"the rule of law.\" Most of us who consent to the rule of law do so because we believe it is the right thing to do, for our own benefit. There are always a few individuals, however, that believe that their own benefit is best served by behavior that does not voluntarily conform to the generally agreed upon social order. These people choose to operate outside of the rule of law and are considered outlaws, criminals, subversives, traitors, revolutionaries, or terrorists. Most national governments have discovered, by trial and error, that the only foreign policy that really works, over time, is a policy called \"tit for tat.\" What this means to you and me is, that governments treat each other the way they are being treated. There is a constant jockeying for position and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freeenergy.txt:5:cf6071e9b0ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9931, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freeenergy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freeenergy", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the generally agreed upon social order.

There is a constant jockeying for position and influence in world affairs, and the strongest party wins! In economics, it's the Golden Rule, which states: \"The one with the gold makes the rules.\" So it is with politics also, but its appearance is more Darwinian. It's simply survival of the fittest. In politics, however, the fittest has come to mean the strongest party who is also willing to fight the dirtiest. Absolutely every means available is used to maintain an advantage over the adversary, and everyone else is the adversary regardless of whether they are considered friend or foe. This includes outrageous psychological posturing, lying, cheating, spying, stealing, assassination of world leaders, proxy wars, alliances and shifting alliances, treaties, foreign aid, and the presence of military forces wherever possible. Like it or not, this is the psychological and actual arena national governments operate in. No national government will do anything that simply gives an adversary an advantage for free. It's national suicide. An activity by any individual, inside or outside the country, that is interpreted as giving an adversary an edge or advantage will be deemed a threat to \"national security.\" Free energy technology is a national government's worst nightmare! Openly acknowledged, free energy technology sparks an unlimited arms race by all governments in a final attempt to gain absolute advantage and domination. Think about it. Do you think Japan will not feel intimidated if China gets free energy? Do you think Israel will sit by quietly as Iraq acquires free energy? Do you think India will allow Pakistan to develop free energy? Do you think the USA would not try to stop Osama bin Laden from getting free energy? Unlimited energy available to the current state of affairs on this planet leads to an inevitable reshuffling of the balance of power. This could become an all-out war to prevent \"the other\" from having the advantage of unlimited wealth and power. Everybody will want it, and at the same time, want to prevent everyone else from getting it. So, national governments are the second force operating to postpone the public availability of free energy technology. Their motivations are \"self-preservation.\" This self-preservation operates on three levels. First, by not giving undue advantage to an external enemy. Second, by preventing individualized action capable of effectively challenging official police powers (anarchy) within the country. And third, by preserving income streams derived from taxing energy sources currently in use. Their weapons include", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freeenergy.txt:6:b4bd409ea5cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9932, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freeenergy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freeenergy", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "same time, want to prevent everyone else from getting it.

Second, by preventing individualized action capable of effectively challenging official police powers (anarchy) within the country. And third, by preserving income streams derived from taxing energy sources currently in use. Their weapons include the preventing of the issuance of patents based on national security grounds, the legal and illegal harassment of inventors with criminal charges, tax audits, threats, phone taps, arrest, arson, theft of property during shipment, and a host of other intimidations which make the business of building and marketing a free energy machine practically impossible. **The third force operating to postpone the public availability of free energy technology consists of the group of deluded inventors and out right charlatans and con men.** On the periphery of the extraordinary scientific breakthroughs that constitute the real free energy technologies, lies a shadow world of unexplained anomalies, marginal inventions and unscrupulous promoters. The first two forces have constantly used the media to promote the worst examples of this group, to distract the public's attention and to discredit the real breakthroughs by associating them with the obvious frauds. Over the last hundred years, dozens of stories have surfaced about unusual inventions. Some of these ideas have so captivated the public's imagination that a mythology about these systems continues to this day. Names like Keely, Hubbard, Coler, and Henderschott immediately come to mind. There may be real technologies behind these names, but there simply isn't enough technical data available in the public domain to make a determination. These names remain associated with a free energy mythology, however, and are sited by debunkers as examples of fraud. The idea of free energy taps very deeply into the human subconscious mind. A few inventors with marginal technologies that demonstrate useful anomalies have mistakenly exaggerated the importance of their inventions. Some of these inventors also have mistakenly exaggerated the importance of themselves for having invented it. A combination of \"gold fever\" and/or a messiah complex appears, wholly distorting any future contribution they may make. While the research thread they are following may hold great promise, these deluded inventors begin to trade enthusiasm for facts, and the value of the scientific work from that point on suffers greatly. There is a powerful, yet subtle seduction that can warp a personality if they believe that the world rests on their shoulders or that they are the world's savior. Strange things also happen to people when they think they are about to become extremely rich.

It takes a tremendous spiritual discipline to remain objective and humble in the presence of a working free energy machine. Many inventors' psyches become unstable just believing they have a free energy machine. As the quality of the science deteriorates, some inventors also develop a persecution complex that makes them very defensive and unapproachable. This process precludes them from ever really developing a free energy machine, and fuels the fraud mythologies tremendously. Then there are the out right con men. In the last 15 years, there is one person in the USA who has raised the free energy con to a professional art. He has raised more than $100,000,000, has been barred from doing business in the state of Washington, has been jailed in California, and he's still at it. He always talks about a variation of one of the real free energy systems, sells people on the idea that they will get one of these systems soon, but ultimately sells them only promotional information which gives no real data about the energy system itself. He has mercilessly preyed upon the Christian community and the patriot community in the USA, and is still going strong. This man's current scam involves signing up hundreds of thousands of people as locations where he will install a free energy machine. In exchange for letting him put the free energy generator in their home, they will get free electricity for life, and his company will sell the excess energy back to the local utility company. After becoming convinced that they will receive free electricity for life, with no out-front expenses, they gladly buy a video that helps draw their friends into the scam as well. Once you understand the power and motivations of the first two forces I have discussed, its obvious that this person's current business plan cannot be implemented. This one person has probably done more harm to the free energy movement in the USA than any other force, by destroying people's trust in the technology. **So, the third force postponing the public availability of free energy technology is delusion and dishonesty within the movement itself. The motivations are self-aggrandizement, greed, want of power over others, and a false sense of self-importance. The weapons used are lying, cheating, the \"bait and switch\" con, self-delusion and arrogance combined with lousy science.** **The fourth force operating to postpone the public availability of free energy technology is all of the rest of us.

It may be easy to see how narrow and selfish the motivations of the other forces are, but actually, these motivations are still very much alive in each of us as well. Like the Wealthiest Families, don't we each secretly harbor illusions of false superiority, and the want to control others instead of ourselves? Also, wouldn't you \"sell out\" if the price were high enough, say, take a million dollars, cash, today? Or like the governments, don't we each want to ensure our own survival? If caught in the middle of a full, burning theater, do you panic and push all of the weaker people out of the way in a mad, scramble for the door? Or like the deluded inventor, don't we trade a comfortable illusion once in a while for an uncomfortable fact? And don't we like to think more of ourselves than others give us credit for? Or don't we still fear the unknown, even if it promises a great reward?** You see, really, all four forces are just different aspects of the same process, operating at different levels in the society. There is really only one force preventing the public availability of free energy technology, and that is the unspiritually motivated behavior of the humans. In the last analysis, free energy technology is an outward manifestation of divine abundance. It is the engine of the economy of an enlightened society, where people voluntarily behave in a respectful and civil manner toward each other, where each member of the society has everything they need, and does not covet what their neighbor has, where war and physical violence has become socially unacceptable behavior and people's differences are at least tolerated, if not enjoyed. The appearance of free energy technology in the public domain is the dawning of a truly civilized age. It is an epochal event in human history. Nobody can take credit for it. Nobody can get rich on it. Nobody can rule the world with it. It is simply, a gift from God. It forces us all to take responsibility for our own actions and for our own self-disciplined self-restraint when needed. The world as it is currently ordered, cannot have free energy technology without being totally transformed by it into something else. This civilization has reached the pinnacle of its development, because it has birthed the seeds of its own transformation. Unspiritualized humans cannot be trusted with free energy.

If you go back and read Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged* or the *Club of Rome Report*, it becomes obvious that the wealthiest families have understood this for decades. Their plan is to live in the world of free energy, but permanently freeze the rest of us out. But this is not new. Royalty has always considered the general population (us) to be their subjects. What is new, is that you and I can communicate with each other now better than at anytime in the past. **The Internet offers us, the fourth force, an opportunity to overcome the combined efforts of the other forces preventing free energy technology from spreading.** **The Opportunity** **What is starting to happen is that inventors are [publishing their work](https://web.archive.org/web/20150312123641/http://www.peswiki.com/index.php/Congress:Top_100_Technologies_--_RD), instead of patenting it and keeping it secret. More and more, people are giving away information on these technologies in books, videos and websites.** While there is still a great deal of useless information about free energy on the Internet, the availability of good information is rising rapidly. Check out the list of websites and other resources at the end of this article. It is imperative that you begin to gather all of the information you can on real free energy systems. The reason for this is simple. The first two forces will never allow an inventor or a company to build and sell a free energy machine to you! The only way you will ever get one is if you, or a friend, build it yourself. This is exactly what thousands of people are already quietly starting to do. You may feel wholly inadequate to the task, but start gathering information now. You may be just a link in the chain of events for the benefit of others. Focus on what you can do now, not on how much there still is to be done. Small, private research groups are working out the details as you read this. Many are committed to publishing their results on the Internet. **All of us constitute the fourth force.

They will not help us be free from their manipulations. Nevertheless, free energy technology is here. It is real, and it will change everything about the way we live, work and relate to each other. In the last analysis, free energy technology obsoletes greed and the fear for survival. But like all exercises of spiritual faith, we must first manifest the generosity and trust in our own lives. The source of free energy is inside of us. It is that excitement of expressing ourselves freely. It is our spiritually guided intuition expressing itself without distraction, intimidation or manipulation. It is our open-heartedness. Ideally, the free energy technologies underpin a just society where everyone has enough food, clothing, shelter, self-worth, and the leisure time to contemplate the higher spiritual meanings of life. Do we not owe it to each other to face down our fears and take action to create this future for our children's children? **Free energy technology is here. It has been here for decades. Communications technology and the Internet have torn the veil of secrecy off of this remarkable fact.** People all over the world are starting to build free energy devices for their own use. The bankers and the governments do not want this to happen, but cannot stop it. There will be essentially no major media coverage of what is going on. Tremendous economic instabilities and wars will be used in the near future to distract people from joining the free energy movement. Western society is in many ways spiraling down toward self-destruction due to the accumulated effects of long-term greed and corruption. The general availability of free energy technology cannot stop this trend. It can only reinforce it. If, however, you have a free energy device, you may be better positioned to support the political/social/economic transition that is underway. The question is, who will ultimately control the emerging world government-the first force or the fourth force? The last great war is almost upon us. The seeds are planted. After this will come the beginning of a real civilization. Some of us who refuse to fight will survive to see the dawn of the world of free energy. I challenge you to be among the ones who try. **LIST OF RESOURCES:** **Books ** *[Hidden Energy](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Energy-Tesla-inspired-inventors-abundance/dp/1525549650)* by Jeane Manning and Susan Manewich *Living Energies* by Callum", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:freeenergy.txt:11:add432ad14b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9937, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "freeenergy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "freeenergy", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "ultimately control the emerging world government-the first force or the fourth force?

The most amazing part of the process is that it's self-sustaining. The 2,200°F syngas is fed into a cooling system, generating steam that drives turbines to produce electricity. About two thirds of the power is siphoned off to run the converter; the rest can be used on-site for heating or electricity, or sold back to the utility grid. New York City is already paying an astronomical $90 a ton to get rid of its trash. According to Startech, a few 2,000-ton-per-day plasma-gasification plants could do it for $36. **Eco-car more efficient than light bulb July 5, 2005, CNN**[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/07/04/eco.car](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/07/04/eco.car/) The hydrogen-powered Ech2o needs just 25 Watts -- the equivalent of less than two gallons of petrol -- to complete the 25,000-mile global trip, while emitting nothing more hazardous than water. But with a top speed of 30mph, the journey would take more than a month to complete. Ech2o, built by British gas firm BOC, will bid to smash the world fuel efficiency record of over 10,000 miles per gallon at the Shell Eco Marathon. The record is currently....5,385 km/per liter [over 12,000 mpg!]. **Fuel's paradise?

It had nothing to do with obscenity, but it had everything to do with extremist politics. The \"Slam Team\" was a group of teenage poets who asked Nevins to serve as faculty adviser to their club. The teens, mostly shy youngsters, were taught to read their poetry aloud and before audiences. Rio Rancho High School gave the Slam Team access to the school's closed-circuit television once a week and the poets thrived. In March 2003, a teenage girl named Courtney presented one of her poems before an audience at Barnes & Noble bookstore in Albuquerque, then read the poem live on the school's closed-circuit television channel. A school military liaison and the high school principal accused the girl of being \"un-American\" because she criticized the war in Iraq and the Bush administration's failure to give substance to its \"No child left behind\" education policy. The girl's mother, also a teacher, was ordered by the principal to destroy the child's poetry. The mother refused and may lose her job. Bill Nevins was suspended for not censoring the poetry of his students. Remember, there is no obscenity to be found in any of the poetry. He was later fired by the principal. After firing Nevins and terminating the teaching and reading of poetry in the school, the principal and the military liaison read a poem of their own as they raised the flag outside the school. When the principal had the flag at full staff, he applauded the action he'd taken in concert with the military liaison. Then to all students and faculty who did not share his political opinions, the principal shouted: \"Shut your faces.\" What a wonderful lesson he gave those 3,000 students at the largest public high school in New Mexico. In his mind, only certain opinions are to be allowed. But more was to come. Posters done by art students were ordered torn down, even though none was termed obscene. Some were satirical, implicating a national policy that had led us into war.

In his mind, only certain opinions are to be allowed. But more was to come. Posters done by art students were ordered torn down, even though none was termed obscene. Some were satirical, implicating a national policy that had led us into war. Art teachers who refused to rip down the posters on display in their classrooms were not given contracts to return to the school in this current school year. The message is plain. Critical thinking, questioning of public policies and freedom of speech are not to be allowed to anyone who does not share the thinking of the school principal. The teachers union has been joined in a legal action against the school by the National Writers Union, headquartered in New York City. NWU's at-large representative Samantha Clark lives and works in Albuquerque. The American Civil Liberties Union has become the legal arm of the lawsuit pending in federal court. Meanwhile, Nevins applied for a teaching post in another school and was offered the job but he can't go to work until Rio Rancho's principal sends the new school Nevins' credentials. The principal has refused to do so, and that adds yet another issue to the lawsuit, which is awaiting a trial date. While students are denied poetry readings, poetry clubs and classes in poetry, Nevins works elsewhere and writes his own poetry. Writers and editors who have spent years translating essays, films, poems, scientific articles and books by Iranian, North Korean and Sudanese authors have been warned not to do so by the U.S. Treasury Department under penalty of fine and imprisonment. Publishers and film producers are not allowed to edit works authored by writers in those nations. The Bush administration contends doing so has the effect of trading with the enemy, despite a 1988 law that exempts published materials from sanction under trade rules. Robert Bovenschulte, president of the American Chemical Society, is challenging the rule interpretation by violating it to edit into English several scientific papers from Iran. Are book burnings next? Hill is a retired News-Journal reporter. **A note from Fred:** I invite us to explore for parts within ourselves that don't want to truth to be known, or don't want others to speak their mind on certain topics. As we work to support freedom of expression and free speech rights in this nation and world, let us also work to support those things within ourselves.

The amazing six-minute video clip on Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination is taken from award-winning Canadian journalist [Barry Zwicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie_Zwicker)'s coverage of a little-known Memphis court trial that happened in 1999. **After hearing 70 witnesses testify over the course of one month, the jury in this trial unanimously found the Memphis police and U.S. government, among others, guilty of King's assassination.** Yet this amazing court victory for the King family was completely censored by the media, as described by Zwicker in his excellent presentation on Canada's [Vision TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_TV).

PEERS and WantToKnow.info would also like to appeal to you for any generosity you can muster in these challenging times. Even though we have cut our expenses nearly in half - from $21,000 at this time last year to $12,000 this year - donations have dropped from $18,000 to less than $5,000 over the same time period. As a result, **PEERS is over $7,000 in the red for this year.** We fully understand that many of you are also facing economic difficulties, yet we ask you to consider if our work is worth the price of a movie or a good book to you.

As of the end of 2011, PEERS has been providing inspiration and education free of charge to many millions of interested people around the globe for six years. We continue to touch countless people's hearts and make a difference in our world in a most meaningful way. Both donations to and interest in our websites and email lists grew significantly in the past year. The total amount of contributions increased by 20% over 2010, while the number of donors increased by an impressive 35%. And thanks to a wonderful outpouring of support in December, PEERS expenditures for the year were only slightly more than income. PEERS websites received a total volume for 2011 of nearly 2.9 million visits and 4.7 million page views (over 12,000/day), an overall increase of around 30% over the previous year. The number of subscribers to our WantToKnow.info email list broke the 10,000 mark just this past December. Our [two email lists](https://www.peerservice.org/subscribe_peers)combined now have over 12,000 subscribers from more than 140 countries. \"I am shocked you don't have a million subscribers. The information you send is always very interesting and well documented.\" ~~ Rudy A., Jan. 1, 2012 A questionnaire was made available to our WantToKnow.info email list subscribers at the end of the year using a rating scale of one to five stars. Out of 125 respondents, 97% ranked the overall quality of our email list as either four or five stars and 94% did the same for our website. Clearly, the empowering work of PEERS is educating and inspiring ever more people around the world. Hundreds of people sent messages expressing gratitude for our work this year. \"Thank you so much for all you do to keep us informed and motivated. I truly believe PEERS is the best source of unsensationalized news and information.\" ~~ Bill T. on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), Dec. 25, 2011 \"Thank you for the beautiful, loving and informative website.

Only 20 registered participants completed one of our courses last year, down from 40 last year. Yet registration is not required to take a course, and we know from emails and website statistics that many unregistered individuals complete one or more of the courses. Despite the smaller number of graduates, almost everyone who has completed a course continues to give glowing reviews. \"Just a few days after I did lesson three, my dear husband and I had a heartfelt and life-changing conversation filled with honesty and transparency. We finally both had the courage to explore some of our deepest needs and found out that we were each wrong about the other's opinions and feelings about those needs. It was amazing, and I KNOW without a doubt that had I not found this course, this conversation would not have come to the peaceful and loving end (and new beginning!) that it did.

A powerful summary was added of the [Hidden Hand material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/deep_insider_creation_story) dealing with the network of [secret societies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles)which has played a major role in the evolution of humankind. And our amazing database of summaries of [revealing news articles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) has grown to well over 4,000 articles. We continue to get lots of supportive and grateful feedback on our websites, email lists, and online courses. Here is a further sampling of the many wonderful emails of support we received this year. \"I am very impressed with your web site. It is the most complete, well structured and positive information center that I have found on the net. It would be wonderful to translate your site.\" ~~ Bernadette in Germany on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), Oct. 15, 2011 \"When i found your Web of Love, i literally fell into Light, Harmony, and most of all LOVE. This is how we can all find love, the answer to everything! All i can do now is spread your message far and wide. You are great. My heart kisses your heart.\" ~~ Echo C. on the [Web of Love](https://www.weboflove.org) website, Feb. 19, 2011 \"I just want to say a great big 'thank you' for this priceless website. The wealth of reliable and knowledgeable information it contains seems never ending. I am in awe of all that you've accomplished, and truly grateful for beings of light and truth who have the courage to step forth and tell it like it is. Bravo and all the best to every one of you.\" ~~ Corrine V. on WantToKnow.info, April 16, 2011 **PEERS Finances** PEERS had a total income of $39,736 in 2011, a 20% increase from 2010. All but 4% of this came in the form of donations from generous supporters. The number of individuals making monthly contributions decreased by five to 57 in 2011, though the number of caring individuals who made one or more donations during the year increased by an impressive 35% to 420. While many other nonprofits are struggling financially, PEERS is most thankful to have such strong support. Our total expenses for the year were $39,905, up 44% from 2010.

There was a good reason for this increase. After volunteering full time on the PEERS websites for several years and donating over $25,000 of his own limited funds, PEERS income finally justified compensating Executive Director Fred Burks at $1,000 per month in 2010. In 2011, as we had a good buffer in the bank, the PEERS board of directors agreed to increase this amount to $2,000 per month. Fred continues to work full time for PEERS at a compensation rate for his position well below that of other nonprofits. Even with the significant increase in expenses, PEERS ended up only $169 in the red for the year of 2011. This was largely thanks to a major outpouring of support in December, when 208 contributors donated a record of nearly $11,000 in one month. As a result, we are quite pleasantly surprised that PEERS still has $23,428 in the bank, down just slightly from the previous year. Our two major expenses last year were $23,000 to Fred for his continued excellent management of PEERS, and $13,100 for Tod's quality weekly news summaries. Another $1,050 went to our web wizard Andrey for his brilliant and highly useful technical support. The remaining $2,755 went to pay Internet expenses, PayPal fees, government taxes and fees, insurance, and more for running the websites and nonprofit organization.

That was a mistake. I am doing my best to rectify the situation. I will not have time to answer all the emails coming in about this. This message is meant to explain what's happening. **The 7,000 subscribers who did not receive this confirmation email can ignore this message.** I'm also including below the normal message that went out today to those 7,000, but did not go out to the others. To understand why this happened, let me give a brief background. **As too many of our emails were being filtered to spam, we chose to switch to a new email service provider.** We first chose Constant Contact to be our provider about two months ago. Unfortunately, though very few messages were filtered to spam. there were problems with functionality there. We then switched to GetResponse about a month ago. Sadly, though they had great functionality, some emails were still being filtered to spam. So just yesterday I signed up for AWeber, which I hoped would provide both good functionality and high deliverability rates. **When I uploaded our database of subscribers to AWeber yesterday, initially they could only accept 7,000 of our 14,500 subscribers,** as they monitor new users closely and understandably wanted to make sure our list of subscribers contained legitimate email addresses. They asked me to send a message out to the 7,000 accepted subscribers, so that they could verify the legitimacy of our readers. I was told that I would then be able to send this message out to the remainder of the list after verification. So I sent out a message on a great video about suppressed cancer treatments, which is now included below in this message for those who did not receive it. I got approval today to upload the remaining 7,500 subscribers. Unfortunately, I must have done something that caused all 7,500 subscribers to receive the above-mentioned confirmation message, which did not go out to the first 7,000. As it is set up right now, I can't send a message out to any of those subscribers until they click the confirmation email. **I'm working to change that, so that all 7,500 email addresses will be automatically uploaded.

Though providing a much fuller story and some excellent information, the full version of \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" has a tendency to paint allopathic medicine as all bad. Clearly Western medicine has its place. Yet there is ample evidence that it can be somewhat myopic in its views on alternative medicine. As there are so few good documentaries on this topic, the film's producers can be forgiven for their anti-allopathic sentiments. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" presents [Essiac](http://www.essiacinfo.org/), the [Hoxsey treatment](https://web.archive.org/web/20080410172749/http://www.cancure.org/hoxsey_clinic.htm), [Gerson therapy](http://gerson.org/gerpress/the-gerson-therapy/), [laetrile](http://www.naturalnews.com/laetrile.html), and [shark cartilage](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0820_030820_sharkcancer.html) as potential cancer cures. For more on these, click on the links provided. **This film explains how it is virtually impossible for these inexpensive, natural treatments to receive government approval.** The FDA requires extremely expensive clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment, yet due to minimal profit in natural cures, trials will likely never be conducted, thus preventing approval of natural treatments, even if they do cure cancer. **The Medical Establishment Doesn't Want an Inexpensive Cancer Cure** Even more problematic are those within the medical industry who have a vested interest in preventing alternative treatments from even gaining publicity, let alone approval. Chemotherapy drugs net [billions of dollars in profits](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/health-corruption) every year, fattening the wallets of physicians and drug company officers and stockholders.

Fishbein, who was glowingly featured in a 1937 [cover story of*Time*magazine](http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19370621,00.html), was actively involved in suppressing the alleged cancer cures in two of the five cases presented in this documentary, as well as many others not mentioned. [An article](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760551-1,00.html) in *Time* only two years later describes how Fishbein and the AMA were indicted for profiteering through limiting a patient's choice of doctor and preventing competition among doctors. Fishbein was also the main force behind the AMA's promotion of smoking. After leaving the AMA, he became [consultant to a tobacco company](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563588/) dedicated to minimizing any link between smoking and cancer. Quite the opposite of the *New England Journal of Medicine*'s courageous chief editor Marcia Angell, who worked tirelessly to [expose the blatant manipulations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) of the drug industry, Fishbein was seen by many as much more interested in making money than in protecting public health. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" further shows how **famous cancer institutes like the esteemed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prevented both studies and the publication of any information that might show that alternative treatments did, in fact, have significant cancer cure rates.** Read what Sloan-Kettering's own assistant director of public affairs, Dr. Ralph Moss (now [a top advocate](http://cancerdecisions.com) of alternative cancer therapies), had to say about this in his essay at[this link](http://www.consumerhealth.org/articles/display.cfm?ID=19990303164550). Moss was fired simply for speaking the truth of what he saw. Many in the medical establishment clearly have a vested interest in suppressing any natural cancer cures. **The Good News** The exciting news is that thanks to the Internet and caring people like you, the truth is reaching ever greater numbers of people around the globe.

If there were a magic bullet, though, it might be something like dichloroacetate, or DCA, a drug that kills cancer cells by exploiting a fundamental weakness found in a wide range of solid tumors. So far, though, it kills them just in test tubes and in rats infected with human cancer cells; it has never been tested against cancer in living human beings. DCA ... is an existing drug whose side effects are well-studied and relatively tolerable. Also, it's a small molecule that might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach otherwise intractable brain tumors. Within days after a technical paper on DCA appeared in the journal Cancer Cell last week, the lead author, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule. It acts in the body to promote the activity of the mitochondria. Researchers have assumed that the mitochondria in cancer cells were irreparably damaged. But Michelakis wondered if that was really true. With his colleagues he used DCA to turn back on the mitochondria in cancer cells-which promptly died. **One", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__apology160415.txt:4:1296a0cb5ff2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9963, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__apology160415.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__apology160415", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule.

A small team of researchers is working to understand the genetic and immunological basis of the surprising phenomenon. Preliminary studies hint at the existence of a similar resistance in humans. Researchers hope that harnessing the biological process could lead to a new approach to treating cancer. But Dr. Zhen Cui of Wake Forest, whose team published the findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, said he expected rapid replication of the results because the findings were so clear-cut and easily observed. \"This is a truly remarkable phenomenon -- and it really needs confirmation from other institutions,\" he said. The team took white blood cells from the immune mice ... and injected them into mice already carrying a variety of tumors, some of which were extremely aggressive. In every case, the cancers were destroyed, even if the cells were injected at a point distant from the tumor. Healthy tissues were not affected. The mice that received the cells, furthermore, were protected from new tumors for the rest of their lives. The researchers have no idea how the immunity continues. **Note:**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__apology160415.txt:5:60a49fbe7e9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9964, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__apology160415.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__apology160415", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "team took white blood cells from the immune mice ... and injected them into mice already carrying a variety of tumors, some of which were extremely aggressive.

The results fall short of an immediate cancer cure, but they are encouraging, medical professionals say. JoEllen Welsh, a researcher with the State University of New York at Albany, has studied the effects of vitamin D for 25 years. **Part of her research involves taking human breast cancer cells and treating them with a potent form of vitamin D. Within a few days, half the cancer cells shriveled up and died.** Welsh said the vitamin has the same effect as a drug used for breast cancer treatment. \"Vitamin D enters the cells and triggers the cell death process,\" she [said]. \"It's similar to what we see when we treat cells with Tamoxifen,\" a drug used to treat breast cancer. The vitamin's effects were even more dramatic on breast cancer cells injected into mice. After several weeks of treatment,** the cancer tumors in the mice shrank by an average of more than 50 percent. **Some tumors disappeared. Similar results have been achieved on colon and prostate cancer tumors in mice. **Note:** For key excerpts from dozens of major media articles relating fascinating, but little-known information on potential cancer cures, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/cancercuresnewsarticles). **For those looking for an effective cancer treatment, you can find useful information at the websites [available here](http://cancerdecisions.com/), [here](http://alternativecancer.us/), [here](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/04/23/dr-nicholas-gonzalez-on-alternative-cancer-treatments.aspx), and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_cancer_treatments).** For a highly rated book describing many promising alternative cancer cures in detail, [click here](http://www.amazon.com/Outsmart-Your-Cancer-Alternative-Treatments/dp/0972886788/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1305236639&sr=1-1).

Don't Let Them!**** By Bill Moyers December 22, 2015** In the fall of 2001, in the aftermath of 9/11, as families grieved and the nation mourned, Washington swarmed with locusts of the human kind: wartime opportunists, lobbyists, lawyers, ex-members of Congress, bagmen for big donors: all of them determined to grab what they could for their corporate clients and rich donors while no one was looking. Across the land, the faces of Americans of every stripe were stained with tears. **Here in New York, we still were attending memorial services for our firemen and police. But in the nation's capital, within sight of a smoldering Pentagon that had been struck by one of the hijacked planes, the predator class was hard at work pursuing private plunder at public expense, gold-diggers in the ashes of tragedy exploiting our fear, sorrow, and loss.** What did they want? The usual: tax cuts for the wealthy and big breaks for corporations. They even made an effort to repeal the alternative minimum tax that for fifteen years had prevented companies from taking so many credits and deductions that they owed little if any taxes. And it wasn't only repeal the mercenaries sought; they wanted those corporations to get back all the minimum tax they had ever been assessed. They sought a special tax break for mighty General Electric, although you would never have heard about it if you were watching GE's news divisions - NBC News, CNBC, or MSNBC, all made sure to look the other way. They wanted to give coal producers more freedom to pollute, open the Alaskan wilderness to drilling, empower the president to keep trade favors for corporations a secret while enabling many of those same corporations to run roughshod over local communities trying the protect the environment and their citizens' health. **It was a disgusting bipartisan spectacle. With words reminding us of Harry Truman's description of the GOP as \"guardians of privilege,\" the Republican majority leader of the House dared to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning.txt:0:7b8453140d79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9967, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "way.

With words reminding us of Harry Truman's description of the GOP as \"guardians of privilege,\" the Republican majority leader of the House dared to declare that \"it wouldn't be commensurate with the American spirit\" to provide unemployment and other benefits to laid-off airline workers. As for post 9/11 Democrats, their national committee used the crisis to call for widening the soft-money loophole in our election laws.** America had just endured a sneak attack that killed thousands of our citizens, was about to go to war against terror, and would soon send an invading army to the Middle East. If ever there was a moment for shared sacrifice, for putting patriotism over profits, this was it. But that fall, operating deep within the shadows of Washington's Beltway, American business and political mercenaries wrapped themselves in red, white and blue and went about ripping off a country in crisis. H.L. Mencken got it right: \"Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.\" Fourteen years later, we can see more clearly the implications. After three decades of engineering a winner-take-all economy, and buying the political power to consummate their hold on the wealth created by the system they had rigged in their favor, they were taking the final and irrevocable step of separating themselves permanently from the common course of American life. They would occupy a gated stratosphere far above the madding crowd while their political hirelings below look after their earthly interests. **The $1.15 trillion spending bill passed by Congress last Friday and quickly signed by President Obama is just the latest triumph in the plutocratic management of politics that has accelerated since 9/11.** As Michael Winship and I described [here last Thursday](http://billmoyers.com/story/lurking-within-that-ominous-omnibus-spending-bill/), the bill is a bonanza for the donor class - that powerful combine of corporate executives and superrich individuals whose money drives our electoral process. Within minutes of its passage, congressional leaders of both parties and the president rushed to the television cameras to praise each other for a bipartisan bill that they claimed signaled the end of dysfunction; proof that Washington can work. Mainstream media (including public television and radio), especially the networks and cable channels owned and operated by the conglomerates, didn't stop to ask: \"*Yes, but work for whom?*\" Instead, the anchors acted as amplifiers for official spin - repeating the mantra-of-the-hour that while this is not \"a perfect bill,\" it does a lot of good things. \"*But for whom? At what price?*\" went", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning.txt:1:d265f213bdb5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9968, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__bill-moyers-plutocrats-winning", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "for a bipartisan bill that they claimed signaled the end of dysfunction; proof that Washington can work.

At what price?*\" went unasked. Now we're learning. Like the drip-drip-drip of a faucet, over the weekend other provisions in the more than 2000-page bill began to leak. Many of the bad ones we mentioned on Thursday are there - those extended tax breaks for big business, more gratuities to the fossil fuel industry, the provision to forbid the Securities & Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose their political spending, even to their own shareholders. That one's a slap in the face even to Anthony Kennedy, the justice who wrote the Supreme Court's majority opinion in *Citizens United*. He said: \"With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions.\" Over our dead body, Congress declared last Friday, proclaiming instead: **Secrecy today. Secrecy tomorrow. Secrecy forever. They are determined that we not know who owns them.** **The horrors mount. As Eric Lipton and Liz Moyer reported for *The New York Times* on Sunday, in the last days before the bill's passage \"lobbyists swooped in\" to save, at least for now, a loophole worth more than $1 billion to Wall Street investors and the hotel, restaurant and gambling industries.** Lobbyists even helped draft crucial language that the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid furtively inserted into the bill. Lipton and Moyer wrote that, \"The small changes, and the enormous windfall they generated, show the power of connected corporate lobbyists to alter a huge bill that is being put together with little time for lawmakers to consider. Throughout the legislation, there were thousands of other add-ons and hard to decipher tax changes.\" No surprise to read that \"some executives at companies with the most at stake are also big campaign donors.\" The *Times* reports that \"the family of David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG Capital, has donated $1.2 million since 2014 to the Senate Majority PAC, a campaign fund with close ties to Mr. Reid and other Senate Democrats.\" Senator Reid, lest we forget, is from Nevada. As he approaches retirement at the end of 2016, perhaps he's hedging his bets at taxpayer expense. **Consider just two other provisions: One, insisted upon by Republican Senator Thad Cochran, directs the Coast Guard to build a $640 million National Security Cutter in Cochran's home state of Mississippi, a ship that the Coast Guard says it does not need.

The other: A demand by Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins for an extra $1 billion for a Navy destroyer that probably will be built at her state's Bath Iron Works - again, a vessel our military says is unnecessary.** **So it goes: The selling off of the Republic, piece by piece. What was it Mark Twain said? \"There is no distinctive native American criminal class except Congress.\"** Can we at least face the truth? The plutocrats and oligarchs are winning. The vast inequality they are creating is a death sentence for government by consent of the people at large. Did any voter in any district or state in the last Congressional election vote to give that billion dollar loophole to a handful of billionaires? To allow corporations to hide their political contributions? To add $1.4 trillion to the national debt? Of course not. It is now the game: Candidates ask citizens for their votes, then go to Washington to do the bidding of their donors. And since one expectation is that they will cut the taxes of those donors, we now have a permanent class that is afforded representation without taxation. **A plutocracy, says my old friend, the historian Bernard Weisberger, \"has a natural instinct to perpetuate and enlarge its own powers and by doing so slams the door of opportunity to challengers and reduces elections to theatrical duels between politicians who are marionettes worked by invisible strings.\"** Where does it end? By coincidence, this past weekend I watched the final episode of the British television series *Secret State*, a 2012 remake of an earlier version based on the popular novel *A Very British Coup*. This is white-knuckle political drama. Gabriel Byrne plays an accidental prime minister - thrust into office by the death of the incumbent, only to discover himself facing something he never imagined: a shadowy coalition of forces, some within his own government, working against him. With some of his own ministers secretly in the service of powerful corporations and bankers, his own party falling away from him, press lords daily maligning him, the opposition emboldened, and a public confused by misinformation, deceit, and vicious political rhetoric, the prime minister is told by Parliament to immediately invade Iran (on unproven, even false premises) or resign.

In the climactic scene, he defies the \"Secret State\" that is manipulating all this and confronts Parliament with this challenge: Let's forget party allegiance, forget vested interests, forget votes of confidence. Let each and every one of us think only of this: Is this war justified? Is it what the people of this country want? Is it going to achieve what we want it to achieve? And if not, then what next? Well, I tell you what I think we should do. We should represent the people of this country. Not the lobby companies that wine and dine us. Or the banks and the big businesses that tell us how the world goes 'round. Or the trade unions that try and call the shots. Not the civil servants nor the war-mongering generals or the security chiefs. Not the press magnates and multibillion dollar donors... [We must return] democracy to this House and the country it represents. Do they? The movie doesn't tell us. We are left to imagine how the crisis - the struggle for democracy - will end. **As we are reminded by this season, there is more to life than politics. There are families, friends, music, worship, sports, the arts, reading, conversation, laughter, celebrations of love and fellowship and partridges in pear trees. But without healthy democratic politics serving a moral order, all these are imperiled by the ferocious appetites of private power and greed.** So enjoy the holidays, including *Star Wars*. Then come back after New Year's and find a place for yourself, at whatever level, wherever you are, in the struggle for democracy. This is the fight of our lives and how it ends is up to us. * * * * * *View [all](http://billmoyers.com/author/moyersb/) of Bill Moyers' essays.* **Note:** This article originally appeared as [an article](http://billmoyers.com/story/the-plutocrats-are-winning-dont-let-them/) on Bill Moyers' website.

When Ernest, my appliance repairman, came to the front door, I welcomed him in. As this was his second visit and we'd established a friendly rapport, I asked him how he was feeling in the current national climate. Naturally, he assumed I was talking about the coronavirus, because what white person actually addresses racism head on, in person, in their own home? When Ernest realized I wanted to know about his experience with racism, he began answering my questions. What's it like for you on a day-to-day basis as a black man? Do cops ever give you any trouble? The answers were illuminating. **Ernest, a middle-aged, friendly, successful business owner, gets pulled over in Myrtle Beach at least 6 times a year. He doesn't get pulled over for traffic violations, but on the suspicion of him being a suspect in one crime or another.** Mind you, he is in uniform, driving in a work van clearly marked with his business on the side. They ask him about the boxes in his car - parts and pieces of appliances. They ask to see his invoices and ask him why there is money and checks in his invoice clipboard. They ask if he's selling drugs. These cops get angry if he asks for a badge number or pushes back in any way. Every time he is the one who has to explain himself, although they have no real cause to question him. Ernest used to help folks out after dark with emergencies. Not anymore.

Let me say that again. **Ernest, a middle aged black man in uniform cannot work past dark in Myrtle Beach in 2020 because it's not safe for him.** He did not say this with any kind of agenda. It was a quiet, matter of fact truth. A truth that needs to be heard. When I asked Ernest what ethnic terms he gets offended at, he said that the most offensive term people use is 'boy'. Ernest has a bachelors in electronics and an associates in HVAC [Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning]. He is not a 'boy', and the term 'boy' in the south implies inferiority in station and status. **He came to Myrtle Beach and got a job at Hobart. The supervisor repeatedly used the term 'boy'. Ernest complained. After several complaints Ernest was fired.** Ernest says most white people are a little scared of him, and he's often put in a position where he has to prove himself, as though he's not qualified to repair appliances. After getting a job for 2 years at Sears appliance, Ernest started his own company, one he's been running for several years. He is the best repairman we've had, and has taught me about washer dryers and how to maintain them myself, even helping me with another washer/dryer set and a dishwasher without charging me. I highly recommend his company, Grand Strand Appliance. **Ernest doesn't have hope that racism will change, no matter who the president is. His dad taught him \"It's a white man's world\", and he's done his best to live within it.** When I asked him what I could do, he said, \"everyone needs to pray and realize we're all just one country and one people\". **I am a 45 year old white woman living in the south. I can begin healing our country by talking frankly with African Americans in my world - by LISTENING to their lived experience and speaking up. I can help by actively promoting black owned businesses. That's what I can do today.** Let's start by listening and lifting up. It's that simple.

He started the conversation by saying, \"Caroline, I don't know if I should kill you or kiss you - my phone is ringing off the hook!\" He doesn't have a FB profile, so he's coming over later so I can help him set one up. He's been absolutely overwhelmed, as have I, with the response. We're going to be sitting down together to read your comments. They mean so much. In addition, the Myrtle Beach city manager has contacted me and I'm getting all of us together to be sure this doesn't happen in our city any longer. THANK YOU WORLD. Edit 6/2 9am.

Polarizing media narratives weaponize our emotions and distract the public with paper tigers drowning out real issues. **This noise discourages our ability to emotionally regulate and think clearly. **In psychophysics, the Weber-Fechner Law states that the more noise in an environment, the less signal you hear. **A signal serves as a guiding force that points to something we can trust or feel truth in. **Yet to hear the signal, we can't just rely on our intellectual capacities. **The signal is the integration of two forms of human knowledge: critical thinking and our body-based knowing.** Embodiment coach and author [Philip Shepherd](https://embodiedpresent.com/) says there are two basic modes of intelligence: mind (details, ideas, compare/contrast) and body (felt senses, intuition, subjectivity). Although our thoughts are responsible for solving the real problems we face, we often feel things in our bodies first. We now know that our heart [carries more information to the brain](https://www.heartmath.org/science/), than the brain carries to the heart. This can be an important signal if we pay attention to it. Our instinctual felt sense of things is like a muscle we can strengthen with intentional practice. When the head gets too involved, so often do the reactive defense systems as well, which rely on conditioned patterns that hinder us from thinking outside of the box.** In a society that's diverse and rapidly changing, the ability to hold space for differences and complexity is vital to our collective future. ** Below is a powerful interview with Shepherd for *The Sun Magazine* that highlights his powerful and evolutionary perspective on a new cultural story for humanity.

He was amused to learn that I had written a book called *The Way of the Screenwriter*. He was just finishing a book he'd been working on for eight years, originally titled *The Way of the Actor*. But, he explained, it had become about much more than acting. I asked what it was now about. \"Everything,\" he said. Good luck getting that published, I thought. But it did get published three years later, in the fall of 2010, as [*New Self, New World: Recovering Our Senses in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/New-Self-World-Recovering-Twenty-First/dp/1556439113). I bought a copy more out of loyalty than appetite. I've read plenty of books about \"everything.\" Each of them diagnoses the ailment of living and proposes a single cure. I had become skeptical of such unified-field theories, which seem to constitute a retreat from the world's problems under the guise of trying to solve them. It wasn't until more than a year later, when illness suddenly gave me ample reading time, that I took Shepherd's book off the shelf and began to turn the pages. *New Self, New World* explores the implications of the little-known fact that we have two brains: in addition to the familiar cranial brain in the head, there is a \"second brain\" in the gut. This is not a metaphor. **Scientists recognize the web of neurons lining the gastrointestinal tract as an independent brain, and a new field of medicine - neurogastroenterology - has been created to study it.** According to Shepherd, there is a good reason that we talk about \"gut instinct.\" If cranial thinking sets us apart from the world, the thinking in the belly joins us to it. If the cranial brain believes itself surrounded by a knowable world that can be controlled, the brain in our belly is in touch with the world's mystery. **The fact that the second brain has been discovered, forgotten, and rediscovered by medicine three times in the past century suggests how complicated our relationship with our bodily intelligence is.** **Buchbinder:** You've said that we have a misguided cultural story about what it means to be human. What does that story tell us? **Shepherd: **It tells us that the head should be in charge, because it knows the answers, and the body is little more than a vehicle for transporting the head to its next engagement. It tells us that *doing* is the primary value, while *being* is secondary. It shapes our perceptions, actions, and experiences of life. It separates us from the sensations of the body and alienates us from the world.

It separates us from the sensations of the body and alienates us from the world. And there is no escaping this story; it's embedded in our language, our architecture, our customs, and our hierarchies. It's like the ocean, and we are like fish who swim in it and barely notice it because we've lived with it since infancy. By interpreting reality for us, stories frame and give meaning to our actions. **But there's a danger to living by a story that you can't question, because you start to mistake the story for reality. **And that's where my work starts - in formulating questions that can expose that story and hold it to account. **Buchbinder:** Where did this story come from? **Shepherd: **It dates back to the Neolithic Revolution, which was underway in most of Europe by 6,000 BC and gave us a new way of living: agriculture, permanent settlements, domesticated animals. We started taking charge of our environment. When you domesticate an animal, you become like a god to it. You determine with whom it will mate, and you own its babies. You choose what it will eat and when. And you determine the moment of its death. So at the start of the Neolithic Era humankind was radically altering its relationship with the world. The unforeseen consequence of that, which our culture hasn't yet begun to appreciate, is that we also began to take control of the self in ways that created within us the same divisions we were creating in our relationship with the world. If you go back to the Indo-European roots of the English language, which date from the Neolithic, you find that the word for the hub of a wheel came from the word for navel. The hub is the center around which the wheel revolves. The metaphor suggests that the center of the self was located in the belly. The idea of being centered in the belly shows up in many cultures - Incan, Maya. There is a Chinese word for belly that means \"mind palace.\" Japanese culture rests on a foundation of *hara*, which means \"belly\" and represents the seat of understanding. The Japanese have a host of expressions that use *hara* where we use *head*. We say, \"He's hotheaded.\" They say, \"His belly rises easily.\" We say, \"He has a good head on his shoulders.\" They say, \"He has a well-developed belly.\" **Buchbinder:** This isn't just a semantic issue, is it? **Shepherd:** No, it's deeper. **These cultural differences point out that we have lost", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt:2:3c3a216b2add", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9979, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Japanese culture rests on a foundation of *hara*, which means \"belly\" and represents the seat of understanding.

Our story insists that our thinking happens exclusively in the head. And so we are stuck in the cranium, unable to open the door to the body and join *its* thinking. The best we can do is put our ear to the imaginary wall separating us from it and \"listen to the body,\" a phrase that means well but actually keeps us in the head, gathering information from the outside. **But the body is not outside. The body is you. We are missing the experience of our own being.** To get a sense of what we have lost, it helps to appreciate the forces that carried us into the head. The Neolithic Revolution spawned two major changes in our story: the experiential center of the self, which had been located in the belly, began to migrate upward to the head; and the spiritual center of our culture began to migrate from the earth goddess up to the sky god. In mythological ways of thinking, the body and the world of nature generally are associated with the feminine, while the head and the realm of abstract ideas are associated with the masculine. By around 700 BC, we find the Greek poet Homer making frequent use of the word *phren*, which translates as both \"mind\" and \"diaphragm.\" So by Homer's day the migration of our thinking was about halfway to the head, balanced between male and female. Some rich developments came out of that ancient Greek culture: the birth of Western science, philosophy, literature, theater. But by 350 BC or so the philosopher Plato locates the center of our thinking in the head. In his dialogue *Timaeus* the title character explains that the gods made us by fashioning the soul into a divine sphere, the cranium, and then gave it a vehicle, the body, to carry it around. So the head has the spark of divinity, and the body is a machine. That's been our metaphor ever since. Our culture has been intolerant of attempts to reclaim this lost center of consciousness. In the early 1900s a Chicago anatomist named Byron Robinson wrote a book called *The Abdominal and Pelvic Brain* in which he describes the neurology of an independent brain in the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt:3:14f395ec290c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9980, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "sphere, the cranium, and then gave it a vehicle, the body, to carry it around. So the head has the spark of divinity, and the body is a machine. That's been our metaphor ever since. Our culture has been intolerant of attempts to reclaim this lost center of consciousness. In the early 1900s a Chicago anatomist named Byron Robinson wrote a book called *The Abdominal and Pelvic Brain* in which he describes the neurology of an independent brain in the gut. His work was quickly forgotten - it had no relevance to our cultural story. Then, in the late 1920s, Johannis Langley mapped out the autonomic nervous system. He said there were three divisions: the sympathetic, the parasympathetic, and the enteric. The enteric nervous system, which governs the gastrointestinal functions, is exactly what Robinson called the \"abdominal brain.\" Langley's book became a classic, but the enteric nervous system was widely ignored, and students were taught that the autonomic nervous system has just two divisions. Finally, in the 1960s, Dr. Michael Gershon rediscovered the brain in the gut. **In his book *The Second Brain* he describes how it took him fifteen years of presenting his research and answering refutations before his fellow neuroscientists capitulated and agreed that the neuromass in the belly is indeed an independent brain. **[*Gershon is a professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University. - Ed.*] Robinson, who first discovered the pelvic brain, was much freer in his assessment of its importance than scientists are today. He talked about it as the \"center of life.\" I completely agree with that. It is the center of one's being. **Buchbinder:** How does it meet the criteria for being a brain? **Shepherd:** We shouldn't imagine it as a lump of gray matter. The enteric brain is a web of neurons lining the gut. But it perceives, thinks, learns, decides, acts, and remembers all on its own. You can sever the vagus nerve, which is the main conduit between the two brains, and the brain in the gut just carries on doing its job. So they are both brains, but they are radically different. The enteric brain exists as a network that suffuses the viscera as a whole - which mirrors the way the female aspect of our consciousness feels the world around us as a whole, enabling us to exist in the present. The cranial brain, by contrast, is enclosed in the skull. And that mirrors the way the male aspect of our consciousness can separate itself from the world and create a subject-object relationship, enabling us to think abstractly. These two ways of engaging our intelligence reveal two different versions of the same world. **Buchbinder:** Why bring \"male\" and \"female\" into it? Why associate \"doing\" with the male and \"being\" with the female? **Shepherd:** The terms are imperfect, certainly, because people will tend to hear \"men\" and \"women\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt:4:a887c420bda2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9981, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "enclosed in the skull.

Why associate \"doing\" with the male and \"being\" with the female? **Shepherd:** The terms are imperfect, certainly, because people will tend to hear \"men\" and \"women\" - but I'm not talking about men and women. I'm talking about the complementary opposites that exist in each of us. Whether you are a man or a woman, there is both a masculine aspect to your consciousness and a feminine aspect. To come into wholeness is to realize the indivisible unity of these parts. At this point in our culture the male aspect has eclipsed the female aspect. I see this in both men and women. **We have been taught to mistrust our bodies, to mistrust our intuition, to mistrust any information that is not analytical.** This head-based, masculine perspective gives rise to three serious misunderstandings that drive our culture: we misunderstand what intelligence is, what information is, and what thinking is. Take our understanding of intelligence. We think it's the ability to reason in an abstract fashion, something you can measure with an IQ test. So we remain blind to the impotence of reason in areas of vital concern to us. **You cannot reason your way into being present. You cannot reason your way into love. You cannot reason your way into fulfillment. If you wish to be present, you need to submit to the present, and suddenly you find yourself at one with it. You submit to love.** There's that great quote from the Persian mystic Rumi: \"Your task is not to seek love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.\" **Buchbinder:** If intelligence isn't abstract reasoning, what is it? **Shepherd:** It's sensitivity - specifically a grounded sensitivity, because a reactive sensitivity isn't able to integrate information. A sensitivity to music, to the flight of a swallow, to arithmetic relationship, to a child's tears - all of these are forms of intelligence. And your sensitivity isn't a static, permanent condition. Anything that increases it increases your ability to live more intelligently. Conversely, the constant noise and distractions of modern life have the opposite effect. The jackhammer you walk past on the street diminishes your intelligence by blunting your sensitivity. **Buchbinder:** If this focus on the head began in the Neolithic, are you saying that we need to go back to the Mesolithic? What if the rise of consciousness to the cranial brain was an important part of our development as humans? **Shepherd:** Our task at this point isn't to go back.

What if the rise of consciousness to the cranial brain was an important part of our development as humans? **Shepherd:** Our task at this point isn't to go back. It's not a matter of giving up the ability to think consciously or abstractly; it's a matter of coordinating the two brains. Picture the first astronaut who went into orbit and took a photo of our planet. He brought that unprecedented perspective back home and showed it to people. Suddenly they were newly sensitized to what it means to be a citizen of the planet. They became slightly more intelligent about their relationship with it. I think that new sensitivity contributed to the range of environmental initiatives, such as the Earth Day movement and Friends of the Earth, that sprang forth in the years following that first photo of the earth from space. That story of the astronaut stands as a metaphor for the evolution of our consciousness, but we are only halfway through the journey. We have left our home in the belly and are now \"in orbit\" in the head, viewing the world from a new, somewhat remote vantage point. Just as the astronaut gains perspective by separating from the earth, we gain perspective by stepping back from the body, separating our consciousness from its sensations and dulling our awareness of them. The problem is, we don't know how to bring those perspectives back home so they can be integrated. Without that integration our abstract perspectives can't sensitize us to the world. They merely abet our ability to assert control over it.** Our culture has a tacit assumption that if we can just gather enough information on ourselves and our world, it will add up to a whole. But when you stand back to look at something, there are always details that are hidden from you. **The integration of multiple perspectives into a whole can happen only when, like the astronaut bringing the photo back to earth, we bring this information back to our pelvic bowl, back to the ground of our being, back to the integrating genius of the female consciousness.

Having individuated ourselves from the world, we saw a reality made of individuated bits, a shattered universe of random pieces that have no real relationship with each other. And we still see it that way, because we live in the head. But that's an alienating impoverishment of reality. Quantum mechanics has revealed that not even an electron exists as an individuated bit. It exists as part of a web of relationships. Our relationship with the body has similarly affected our politics, our corporate culture, our language, our cultural values - all of human history. Language tells us explicitly that the head should rule. You'd better have a good *head* on your shoulders. You need to get a*head*. The bosses work in corporate *head*quarters and *head* up committees. *Chief*, *captain*, and *capital* all come from the Latin word for head, so Washington, DC, is literally the \"head\" of the U.S. We call the pope the \"head\" of the Roman Catholic Church. We could call him the \"heart\" of the Church, to emphasize that it's an institution based on faith. Or we could call him the \"lungs\" of the Church, because* spirit* means \"breath.\" The Church might look to its original model, Jesus, who did not live from the head. Instead it's organized as a top-down tyranny, with the pope as its \"head.\" **Buchbinder:** You've talked about our task of integration in terms of what mythologist [Joseph Campbell](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/contributors/joseph-campbell) called the \"hero's journey.\" **Shepherd: **Campbell showed us that almost all cultures have a myth of the hero who journeys into an unfamiliar realm to secure a boon or elixir - a new perspective, as I see it - that, when brought home, will re-energize the hero's society. Now, this myth is telling us about different parts of ourselves. The male aspect of our consciousness has the tendencies of both hero and tyrant. What sends it one way or the other is its relationship to the female aspect of consciousness, which puts us in touch with being.

The hero, as Campbell puts it, is the \"man of self-achieved submission\" - a submission to \"what is.\" When you submit to being, you attune to what the world asks of you: the hero's \"call to action.\" But Campbell characterized the tyrant as the \"man of self-achieved independence\" - and that independence is a separation from being, a refusal of the call. **Buchbinder:** And the call is to acquire the elixir of life and bring it back. **Shepherd**: Right. But our culture is so fixated on its search for new perspectives on existence - on seeing its parts and analyzing them - that we are like an astronaut stuck in orbit. We are alienated from being and cannot find our way home. And that manifests itself on an individual level. Stuck in our heads, we go round and round, trying and failing to control things. It's a form of self-tyranny. We need to come home to our bodies, come to rest in the core of our being, and sensitize ourselves once more to \"what is.\" **Buchbinder:** In the book you compare the effect of our culture's story to those glass wasp traps: easy to get into but not so easy to escape. You were born into this cultural trap, the same as the rest of us. How did you escape? **Shepherd: **It began when I was a teenager. In high school I could feel my thinking being funneled into well-worn ruts: the givens of our culture, the story that it tells about what's right and wrong, up and down. The adults around me seemed to be living in a disconnected fantasy world they had created, and they were waiting for me to join them there. Something in me raged against this - but I knew that, as long as I remained in my native culture, I would succumb to it. So at the age of eighteen I went to England and bought a bicycle, and I set off to ride to Japan. I cycled through Europe, the Middle East, Iran, and India, and along the way I encountered many different ways of understanding what it means to be human - each valid, each luminous. The only time I suffered culture shock was when I came back home. I'd been away two years, and when I returned, the familiar was rendered bizarre. I came back with the ability to raise questions that I had been incapable of asking as long as I remained bound to my culture. **Buchbinder:** What called you to Japan in particular? **Shepherd:** It was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt:8:b24a850d0ada", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9985, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "encountered many different ways of understanding what it means to be human - each valid, each luminous.

I came back with the ability to raise questions that I had been incapable of asking as long as I remained bound to my culture. **Buchbinder:** What called you to Japan in particular? **Shepherd:** It was an experience of classical Noh theater. I saw a production at the age of seventeen and was both moved to tears and utterly bewildered by it. I already loved theater and had seen John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson onstage: the finest actors that Western theater had to offer. And now here was this foreign theatrical tradition that had worked its subtle magic on me, and I had no way of parsing it. I stood at a fork in the road, because I had been accepted to study physics at the University of Toronto, but I was more profoundly baffled by Noh theater than by science; its mysteries mattered more to me. In Japan I learned the concept of *hara*, of living through the belly. Slowly I discovered what it meant to be in that place in the body from which the Noh actors were moving and seeing and thinking and listening. I learned what it meant to be there as an actor, allowing your performance to arise from its holistic intelligence. My book was originally called *The Way of the Actor* because I had started teaching workshops to introduce actors to this other way of being. The main challenge an actor faces is simply how to be present onstage. All acting exercises and lessons are just variations on that theme. So I was teaching these workshops for actors, but people began coming who had no interest in acting: philosophy students, poets, graphic designers. At a certain point I realized that the issues I was delving into might be of interest to a wider audience. **Buchbinder:** In a way it all boils down to how much sensitivity one can bring to bear on the world wherever one happens to be. You and I are having this conversation outside. There's a pond, birds, currents of air. Once you pay attention, you realize how much is going on. **Shepherd: **As I said earlier, our culture misunderstands what information is. **We are addicted to \"digital\" information**. I don't mean literally information that comes to us through digital sources, but rather information that, like a digital signal, is made up of bits and pieces broken off from the whole. We think that's real information. **But there is also \"analog\" information.

Analog information comes to us in a wave. **When you play an old LP record, the needle tracks through the groove, and the waves in the groove - which were shaped by the original sound waves - re-create the music. The form of the wave never changes. Digitally stored music has to be reduced to bits of information that are then interpreted by a computer, which creates sound based on them. But a wave carries more information than even an endless number of bits. Waves from outer space can still tell us about the big bang. **Indigenous Polynesian sailors use information from ocean waves to navigate their way across the Pacific and find an island up to five hundred miles away - an unimaginable feat to the colonial Europeans who first encountered them and still sometimes got lost even with sextants and compasses.** This native navigational tradition was suppressed and prohibited by the Europeans, but it has survived. Navigators are chosen in infancy and are placed in tidal pools for hours, feeling the water's rhythms and currents. When they're fully trained adults, they can sit on the ocean in a canoe and feel multiple swells moving beneath the hull. These deep swells are refraction patterns from islands far beyond the horizon, and they guide the navigators across the trackless ocean. In the same way that the Polynesian sailors are attuned to the energy of the ocean, we need to attune ourselves to the energy of the world. The world is not separate from the self. We are so intimately bound to it that when I raise my hand, the world feels it. When I allow the breath to drop into my body, the world feels it. The world feels my beating heart. **Buchbinder:** Do you mean that metaphorically? **Shepherd:** No, it's simply the reality of how interrelated everything is. In his book *Chance and Chaos*, theoretical physicist David Ruelle asks the reader to imagine that, standing on the earth, you can wave a magic wand and eliminate the gravitational field of a single electron at the farthest edge of the universe. And as you do that, you begin tracking a molecule of oxygen in the air beside you. That molecule will go through about fifty collisions that it would have gone through even if you hadn't waved the wand. Then suddenly it will miss a molecule that it otherwise would have hit. All of this takes less than a second. Thereafter, every molecular collision in the room will be different. And the next day the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt:10:ac7a28fd2fb8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9987, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__brain-gut-intelligence-philip-shepherd", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "the farthest edge of the universe.

All of this takes less than a second. Thereafter, every molecular collision in the room will be different. And the next day the clouds will be different, and the gusts of wind will be different - all because the gravitational field of a single electron at the remotest fringe of the universe has been eliminated. Quantum mechanics tells us that information cannot be destroyed. It lives on through everything it has affected. Eastern philosophy has known for centuries that there is no existence except through relationship. We diminish our sense of being - our sense of our own reality - as we systematically disconnect from body and world. All our modern scientific endeavors have been aimed at knowing the universe in part, because it's \"unscientific\" to feel the whole. Scientists have been striving to find the smallest unit of existence - from the atom to the quark to the string - when in fact the smallest unit of existence is the cosmos itself. It is an indivisible whole. Nothing exists independent of it or can be divided from it. **Buchbinder:** That would include us. So are you saying that our sensitivity is potentially infinite? **Shepherd: **I've witnessed sensitivity in others that is breathtaking in its reach and accuracy. The precondition to sensitivity is stillness. In the same way that a pond on a still day will visibly register the smallest insect alighting on its surface, but on a windy day it won't, our ability to feel the whole is directly proportional to our ability to become still within ourselves. **Consumerism comes out of a craving, at the root of which is our dissociation from being. There's a restless emptiness at our core, an emptiness that has obliterated our sense of \"enough.\"** **Buchbinder:** Perhaps that's why people have their best ideas while relaxing. **Shepherd:** Yes, in England they talk about the \"three Bs,\" where the greatest scientific discoveries are made: the bed, the bath, and the bus. Again, you cannot reason your way into stillness. You cannot just decide to be still. **Our bodies typically carry so much habitual and residual tension within them that our intelligence is confused by all that white noise. The tension is a result of emotions and ideas that haven't been integrated. You get a certain abstract idea that seems right to you, but if you hold on to it too tightly, it will stand between you and your responsiveness to the world, disrupting the information coming to you through the body. **It's the same with emotions.

To survive, we sometimes put our emotions on hold for decades before we're strong enough to integrate them. But they remain in the body, preventing stillness. **Buchbinder**: So to find that stillness, we have to remove the obstacles to it, just as Rumi writes of removing the obstacles to love. **Shepherd: **Yes, and most people have no idea how many obstacles they harbor in their body. **Buchbinder:** When I took your workshop, you gave us an exercise in which one person was to allow another to gently move his or her head around. The fellow whose head I was moving couldn't have been older than twenty, yet his head was almost immobile. He was unable to release it for me to move, in spite of his best efforts. We're like the opposite of the Polynesian child in the tidal pool: we've been placed from infancy in something that prevents us from developing awareness. **Shepherd: **In mythic terms we are the tyrant who won't become the hero. We receive the hero's call but refuse it, because we believe ourselves safe and secure. The head has become our fortified abode, and we hunker in there in the belief that our thinking will save us. But if science, for example, does on occasion seem to save the day, that just reinforces our illusion that we are separate from nature and have only to investigate and intervene in its workings in the right way, and all will be well. So the effect of relying exclusively on science is to more deeply validate our tyrannical tendencies. Myth warns us that when we indulge our tyrannical tendencies, we inherit the tyrant's lot in life. We have no security of being, and so we live with the tyrant's anxieties. We try to fill the emptiness of our being, and so we suffer the tyrant's greed and restlessness. We divorce our doing from our being, and so we suffer the tyrant's loss of grace. In identifying so closely with the tyrant, we have even come to share the tyrannical ideal of freedom, which is the ability to disconnect. The multibillionaire can disconnect from those less fortunate by living in a penthouse suite or a mansion surrounded by acres of groomed grass and an electric fence. He can disconnect from the processes of his own life by hiring someone to cook his food or drive him places.

The multibillionaire can disconnect from those less fortunate by living in a penthouse suite or a mansion surrounded by acres of groomed grass and an electric fence. He can disconnect from the processes of his own life by hiring someone to cook his food or drive him places. He can disconnect from everything ordinary. But the ordinary teapot, the ordinary roadside flower - these join us to the moment and to history and to life. Thanks to our disconnection, we have also inherited the tyrant's rampant fantasies. Experiments with isolation chambers have shown that extreme disconnection leads to hallucinations. And that, on a large scale, is what's happened to our culture. We've gone mad. I can't believe politicians are still talking about the necessity of economic growth - as though the planet were going to grow along with us. The planet cannot grow any more, and we are already crushing it with the weight of our human needs. Our current crises are a product of our hallucinations, which arise directly from our broken relationship with the body. What is asked of the hero at this point in the myth is to surrender: not to assert yet more control, but to come into harmony with the whole. Where there is no harmony, there will be stress and strife and tension. **The tragedy of our culture is that we misunderstand harmony to mean order, because when you're living in your head, order is all you can perceive.** And the more you order things and systematize things and get them \"right,\" the safer you feel. But harmony is the opposite of control: it's an organic whole in which every part answers to every other part. That also describes the reality of the universe. **Buchbinder:** So when we're confronted with tyranny, the solution you're prescribing is \"self-achieved submission.\" But how do you deal with tyranny as a social reality? Surely the answer is not to give in to tyrants and let them have their way. **Shepherd:** You're not surrendering to a political tyrant. *You* are the tyrant who must descend from your fortified abode, reunite with the body's grounded sensitivity, and become aware of the world as it is, as opposed to your concept of it. **The more sensitive you are to the world around you, the more responsive you are. That ability to respond is the basis of *responsibility*. **And the actions it prompts will be a grounded means of addressing a human necessity, not a reflexive action goaded onward by an idea. **Ideas are seductive in their certainty and simplicity, but because any idea is a static construct, it stands independent of the present.

To give your allegiance to an idea is to turn away from the connected intelligence of your being. **I think the most dangerous people in the world are those who feel their *ideas* about the world more keenly than they feel the world itself, because they will be disconnected from what is in front of them and can act only out of their fantasy. Holding fast to an idea, because it's frozen, also promises to excuse you from having to change. But harmony requires us to change along with the whole. If you open yourself to the hum of the world - if you live in the present rather than in your idea of it - it will change you. **Buchbinder:** When I took your workshop, I found it interesting that, although many of the participants were teachers of practices like yoga or Pilates, they didn't necessarily have an easier time doing your exercises than I did. **Shepherd:** A lot of those wonderful body-work practices still emphasize how important it is to \"listen\" to the body. **My work is not about \"listening to the body.\" It's about listening to the world *through the body*.** Once you come to rest in the body, you come to rest in the wholeness that is the trembling world itself. It's as the Greek philosopher Plotinus said: \"All the world breathes together.\" In our \"doing\" society, we have a zeal for sorting out our agenda and implementing it. But in my experience the world is there to guide you at every moment. The world is calling you to come play, to come risk, to let your heart burn with a passion that will make sense of your life. The world will speak to you as intimately as your mother did when you were a child, if you can allow the body to teach you its different way of listening. There's a story about George Washington Carver, the brilliant African American botanist. Someone asked him, \"How is it that you understand these plants so well?\" and he replied, \"If you love it enough, anything will talk to you.\" **Buchbinder:** If you ask indigenous peoples where they got their knowledge of plants, they typically say that the information came from the plants themselves. **Shepherd: **Yes, this idea that early humans went through the woods and sampled plants to see if they were poison or medicine is bizarre.

Again, we think information is digital, that each plant must be examined in isolation and tested. But the truest information is analog. We just have to develop our sensitivity to it - to seek and find all the barriers within ourselves that we have built against it. The Greek philosopher Parmenides laid down the modus operandi of Western thought when he said, in effect: Don't trust the senses. The senses will deceive you. Only reason can lead you to the truth. He went on to reason that nothing could move, despite the fact that our senses tell us the world is constantly in motion. So reason can mislead us every bit as much as the senses can. Our elevation of reason over the real, material world we can touch and taste and feel is part of our demeaning of the feminine. The word *material* is related to *maternal*. There's this urge to leave the material world of sensation and ascend toward the sky, the heady upper realms, where we find the abstract, perfect forms generated by the cranial brain. **Buchbinder:** But is materialism any better? Isn't our consumer society some sort of consolation prize for being separated from the body? **Shepherd: **Modern materialism doesn't honor the material world - it demeans it. We're buying things we'll throw in the garbage in two years. My mother's washing machine worked for forty-five years. Mine was broken beyond repair after eight. The more avidly we consume, the more we turn material objects into worthless waste. Consumerism comes out of a craving, at the root of which is our dissociation from being. There's a restless emptiness at our core, an emptiness that has obliterated our sense of \"enough.\" Our relationship with our body is broken, but it is always the last thing we think about. We try to fix our lives or the world. **Buchbinder: **What about the heart? If the cranial brain is taking care of abstract thought, and the pelvic brain is taking care of our connection to being, what role does the heart play? **Shepherd:** The heart is where the two poles of our consciousness meet; it's the point of balance between the two. In our culture we hear that it's important to open the heart and live from the heart - which is true - but unless the heart is rooted in the ground of your being, it's not going to be supported.

It's like a cut flower as opposed to one that's growing in the earth. So the emphasis on the heart puts the cart before the horse. **Buchbinder: **You mentioned that Japan and China traditionally recognize the belly as a center of intelligence. Does that make their cultures more evolved than ours? **Shepherd: **Well, they are no less tyrannical or patriarchal than ours - and are more so in some ways. In my limited experience, people in those cultures live in either the head or the belly. They haven't integrated the two poles of consciousness. In certain fields they are deeply skilled at attuning to analog information, but putting the head in charge seems to be their default mode. If we're going to continue to evolve as a species, we need to experience our intelligence not as a unipolar phenomenon - all head or all belly - but as an axis. In the same way that a bar magnet has an axis with positive and negative poles that sustain the field around it, our integrated intelligence is an axis through which all these exchanges between the cranial brain and the pelvic brain occur, and its field is our sensitivity. **Buchbinder:** When you teach all of this in a workshop, how do you reply to somebody who says, \"That sounds great, but I have to go to work on Monday in the world of ideas and 'doing.' \" **Shepherd: **You can go into your job and remain in touch with your breath. Allow it to drop to your pelvic floor. Remain in touch with that still point at the core of your being. You don't have to quit your job to do this. Of course, if you do bring your breath down to the pelvic floor, you might realize that you *need* to quit your job. **Buchbinder:** So you can acknowledge the pelvic brain even though you still may be working with ideas. **Shepherd: **Yes. Obviously I love ideas. I wrote a book that's full of them. But my ideas are first and foremost accountable to my experience. A problem arises when your ideas distract you from your experience. **Buchbinder: **That's the tyranny of ideas. **Shepherd:** Yes.

Besides some technical changes to our server, I've experimented with removing images, taking out the \"share this\" icon, using small letters instead of caps for the beginning every word in the subject line, and more. This appears to be working, as in the last month very few messages have been filtered to spam. **The glaring exception is that for both the [email I sent on the war on terror](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-on-terror-fraud) on Nov. 27 and the one I sent yesterday on terrorism odds, all four email address were filtered to spam. **Is there a filtering mechanism for terrorism messages? And now even responses are being filtered. Thankfully, there is an easy way to see if you have missed any message. Every message sent out to the WTK list is posted to our website, and one webpage indexes all of these messages. We usually send out emails twice a week, almost always on Monday or Tuesday and then Friday. If you are having a problem with WTK emails being filtered, you can bookmark the below link as a favorite. **[https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)** There is another way to stop filtering. Most email services have a way to \"white list\" certain email addresses, so that they are never filtered. Each service does this differently, so if you don't know how to do this, you might do an Internet search or contact your email provider to learn how to do this. You can then put our sending email address of emaillist (at) peerservice.org on that list. **Please note also that though I try to send as few financial appeals as possible, we're still about $7,700 in the red for the year, so I'll likely be sending out several more appeals for support this month.** For those who have already contributed, thank you!!!

Some claim chemtrails are nothing but normal jet contrails that take longer than normal to dissipate. [Most lingering jet trails we see are likely contrails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X72uACIN_00), yet reliable evidence suggests that chemtrails are a real phenomenon. An increasing amount of reliable evidence supports the possibility that chemtrails not only are real, but that they are being secretly propagated, possibly by multiple groups with differing agendas. Take a look, for instance, at the over [100 patents](http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/an-exaustive-list-of-patents/) which have been issued related to chemtrails and geoengineering. Click the patent numbers there to read the full patent. **The militaries and intelligence agencies of many countries have been conducting secret tests on their soldiers, and even their citizens for many decades.** Adamant denials are often issued in response to any inquiries on these tests. But then, sometimes only decades later, the truth is revealed in public testimony, as happened in the 1975 Senate [Church Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee) hearings on the [CIA's secret experiments](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol). Excerpts from a [*Wall Street Journal*article](#wsj) below show that \"open-air tests of biological agents were conducted 239 times\" by the US military. Yet all of this was kept secret from the public for decades, including the resulting casualties. Declassified government documents show that as early as 1950, the San Francisco bay area was secretly sprayed by the US military with what was thought to be a harmless microbe to test aerosol dispersion. According to a 2004 [*San Francisco Chronicle*article](#article_3371) on this, \"**army tests showed that the bacterial cloud had exposed hundreds of thousands of people in a broad swath of Bay Area communities**.\" At least one person died and 11 were hospitalized as a result of this test. More recently, [J. Marvin Herndon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marvin_Herndon), a renowned geophysicist whose groundbreaking work has been [reported in the*Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/03/24/is-earths-core-a-nuclear-fission-reactor/d1ea8cf9-5dfb-4b1b-ac3a-b4798b70a04f/) and more, has confirmed [aerial spraying of aluminum](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aluminum-poisoning-of-humanity-and-earths-biota-by-clandestine-geoengineering-300102516.html) on a wide scale, which he says is [threatening the health](http://humansarefree.com/2015/07/nuclear-chemist-publishes-paper.html) of humanity and our planet. In the 2015 abstract for [one of his scientific papers](http://nuclearplanet.com/2173.pdf), he states: \"In response to an urgent call through [an article in Current Science](https://web.archive.org/web/20150626171645/http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/12/2173.pdf) for assistance to understand the geological association of high aluminum mobility with human health in the Ganga Alluvial Plain, I describe evidence of clandestine geoengineering activity that has occurred for at least 15 years, and which has escalated sharply in the last two years.

That said, the first part is well worth watching and includes numerous media news reports on the question of chemtrails. As shown in this revealing documentary and in the media reports below, **toxic amounts of barium, aluminum, and other elements have unexpectedly shown up in numerous soil and water samples around the US, where there is no known explanation other than chemtrails.** This has been confirmed by many scientists. Why has the media given so little coverage to this vital health concern? A second documentary available on [this webpage](https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/the-dimming-full-length-climate-engineering-documentary/) contains some exaggerations, but also presents an abundance of solid, verifiable information on the major cover-up around this topic.

Such \"chemtrails\" are substantially different in appearance to the normal condensation trails left by jet airliners. **The difference is that while condensation trails are composed of water vapor that dissipates rapidly, \"chemtrails\" linger much longer and spread out over time to eventually cover the sky with a thin haze.** The U.S. Air Force Website refutes the \"Chemtrail Hoax\" as having been around since 1996. Before you believe ... the government's \"denial,\" do an Internet search for the following terms: \"[Joint Vision for 2020](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Joint+Vision+for+2020%22)\" and \"[Weather is a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&newwindow=1&q=%22Weather+is+a+Force+Multiplier%3A+Owning+the+Weather+in+2025%22)\", a whitepaper by MIT's Bernard Eastlund and H-bomb father Edward Teller. Before he died in 2003, Teller was director emeritus of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where plans for nuclear, biological and directed energy weapons are crafted. In 1997, Teller publicly outlined his proposal to use aircraft to scatter through the stratosphere millions of tons of electrically-conductive metallic materials, ostensibly to reduce global warming.

In 1950, government officials believed that serratia did not cause disease. That belief was later used as a justification for a secret post-World War II Army experiment that became a notorious disaster tale about the microbe. The Army used serratia to test whether enemy agents could launch a biological warfare attack on a port city such as San Francisco from a location miles offshore. **For six days in late September 1950, a small military vessel near San Francisco sprayed a huge cloud of serratia particles into the air while the weather favored dispersal. Army tests showed that the bacterial cloud had exposed hundreds of thousands of people in a broad swath of Bay Area communities. Soon after the spraying, 11 people came down with hard-to-treat infections** at the old Stanford University Hospital in San Francisco. By November, one man had died. The outbreak was so unusual that the Stanford doctors wrote it up for a medical journal. But the medics and [the dead man's] relatives didn't find out about the Army experiment for nearly 26 years, when a series of secret military experiments came to light. Some people now speculate that descendants of the Army germs are still causing infections here today. The secret bio-warfare test might have permanently changed the microbial ecology of the region. **Note:** The military regularly used humans as guinea pigs in experiments in the decades before and after WWII.

Sometimes the term is deployed against anyone who questions authority, dissents from dominant paradigms, or thinks that hidden interests influence our leading institutions. As such, it is a way to quash dissent and bully those trying to stand up to abuses of power. One needn't abandon critical thinking to believe that powerful institutions sometimes collude, conspire, cover up, and are corrupt. If that is what is meant by a conspiracy theory, obviously some of those theories are true. Does anyone remember [Enron](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-enron-smartest-guys-the-room)? [Iran-Contra](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#10)? [COINTELPRO](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#8)? [Vioxx](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-Merck-hit-list-doctors)? [Iraqi weapons of mass destruction](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-16-years-later-how-press-sold-iraq-war-got-away-with-it)? **During the time of Covid-19, another level of conspiracy theory has risen to prominence that goes way beyond specific stories of collusion and corruption to posit conspiracy as a core explanatory principle for how the world works. ** Fuelled by the authoritarian response to the pandemic (justifiable or not, lockdown, quarantine, surveillance and tracking, censorship of misinformation, suspension of freedom of assembly and other civil liberties, and so on are indeed authoritarian), **this arch-conspiracy theory holds that an evil, power-hungry cabal of insiders deliberately created the pandemic or is at least ruthlessly exploiting it to frighten the public into accepting a totalitarian world government under permanent medical martial law, a New World Order (NWO). ** Furthermore, this evil group, this illuminati, pulls the strings of all major governments, corporations, the United Nations, the WHO, the CDC, the media, the intelligence services, the banks, and the NGOs. In other words, they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__conspiracy-myth.txt:0:e7804bb0590e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10005, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__conspiracy-myth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__conspiracy-myth", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "indeed authoritarian), **this arch-conspiracy theory holds that an evil, power-hungry cabal of insiders deliberately created the pandemic or is at least ruthlessly exploiting it to frighten the public into accepting a totalitarian world government under permanent medical martial law, a New World Order (NWO). ** Furthermore, this evil group, this illuminati, pulls the strings of all major governments, corporations, the United Nations, the WHO, the CDC, the media, the intelligence services, the banks, and the NGOs. In other words, they say, everything we are told is a lie, and the world is in the grip of evil. **So what do I think about that theory? I think it is a myth.** And what is a myth? A myth is not the same thing as a fantasy or a delusion. Myths are vehicles of truth, and that truth needn't be literal. The classical Greek myths, for example, seem like mere amusements until one decodes them by associating each god with psychosocial forces. In this way, **myths bring light to the shadows and reveal what has been repressed. They take a truth about the psyche or society and form it into a story. **The truth of a myth does not depend on whether it is objectively verifiable. That is one reason why, in my essay [The Coronation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronation), I said my purpose is neither to advocate nor to debunk the conspiracy narrative, but rather to look at what it illuminates. **What is true about the conspiracy myth? Underneath its literalism, it conveys important information that we ignore at great peril. ** **First, it demonstrates the shocking extent of public alienation from institutions of authority.** For all the political battles of the post-WWII era, there was at least a broad consensus on basic facts and on where facts could be found. The key institutions of knowledge production - science and journalism - enjoyed broad public trust. If the New York Times and CBS Evening News said that North Vietnam attacked the United States in the Gulf of Tonkin, most people believed it. If science said nuclear power and DDT were safe, most people believed that too. To some extent, that trust was well earned. Journalists sometimes defied the interests of the powerful, as with Seymour Hersh's expose of the My Lai massacre, or Woodward & Bernstein's reporting on Watergate. Science, in the vanguard of civilization's onward march, had a reputation for the objective pursuit of knowledge in defiance of traditional religious authorities, as well as a reputation for lofty disdain for political and financial motives. **Today, the broad consensus trust in science and journalism is in tatters.** I know several highly educated people who believe the earth is flat. By dismissing flat-earthers and the tens of millions of adherents to less extreme alternative narratives (historical, medical, political, and scientific) as ignorant, we are mistaking symptom for cause. Their loss of trust is a clear", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__conspiracy-myth.txt:1:5f05da0e109e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10006, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__conspiracy-myth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__conspiracy-myth", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of knowledge in defiance of traditional religious authorities, as well as a reputation for lofty disdain for political and financial motives. **Today, the broad consensus trust in science and journalism is in tatters.** I know several highly educated people who believe the earth is flat. By dismissing flat-earthers and the tens of millions of adherents to less extreme alternative narratives (historical, medical, political, and scientific) as ignorant, we are mistaking symptom for cause. Their loss of trust is a clear symptom of a loss of trustworthi*ness*. **Our institutions of knowledge production have betrayed public trust repeatedly, as have our political institutions. Now, many people won't believe them even when they tell the truth. **This must be frustrating to the scrupulous doctor, scientist, or public official. To them, the problem looks like a public gone mad, a rising tide of anti-scientific irrationality that is endangering public health. The solution, from that perspective, would be to combat ignorance. It is almost as if ignorance is a virus (in fact, I have heard that phrase before) that must be controlled through the same kind of quarantine (for example, censorship) that we apply to the coronavirus. Ironically, another kind of ignorance pervades both these efforts: the ignorance of the terrain. What is the diseased tissue upon which the virus of ignorance gains purchase? The loss of trust in science, journalism, and government reflects their long corruption: their arrogance and elitism, their alliance with corporate interests, and their institutionalized suppression of dissent. **The conspiracy myth embodies the realization of a profound disconnect between the public postures of our leaders and their true motivations and plans. **It bespeaks a political culture that is opaque to the ordinary citizen, a world of secrecy, image, PR, spin, optics, talking points, perception management, narrative management, and information warfare. No wonder people suspect that there is another reality operating behind the curtains. **Second, the conspiracy myth gives narrative form to an authentic intuition that an inhuman power governs the world. **What could that power be? The conspiracy myth locates that power in a group of malevolent human beings (who take commands, in some versions, from extraterrestrial or demonic entities). Therein lies a certain psychological comfort, because now there is someone to blame in a familiar us-versus-them narrative and victim-perpetrator-rescuer psychology. Alternatively, we could locate the \"inhuman power\" in systems or ideologies, not a group of conspirators. That is less psychologically rewarding, because we can no longer easily identify as good fighting evil; after all, we ourselves participate in these systems, which pervade our entire society. **Systems like the debt-based money system, patriarchy, white supremacy, or capitalism cannot be removed by fighting their administrators. They create roles for evildoers to fill, but the evildoers are functionaries; puppets, not puppet masters.** The basic intuition of conspiracy theories then is true: that those we think hold power are but puppets of the real", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__conspiracy-myth.txt:2:c6b833ec0168", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10007, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__conspiracy-myth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__conspiracy-myth", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "rewarding, because we can no longer easily identify as good fighting evil; after all, we ourselves participate in these systems, which pervade our entire society. **Systems like the debt-based money system, patriarchy, white supremacy, or capitalism cannot be removed by fighting their administrators.

A couple weeks ago I was on a call with a person who had a high position in the Obama administration and who still runs in elite circles. He said, \"There is no one driving the bus.\" I was a little disappointed actually, because there is indeed part of me that wishes the problem were a bunch of dastardly conspirators. Why? Because then our world's problems would be quite easy to solve, at least in principle. Just expose and eliminate those bad guys. That is the prevailing Hollywood formula for righting the world's wrongs: a heroic champion confronts and defeats the bad guy, and everyone lives happily ever after. Hmm, that is the same basic formula as blaming ill health on germs and killing them with the arsenal of medicine, so that we can live safe healthy lives ever after, or killing the terrorists and walling out the immigrants and locking up the criminals, all again so that we can live safe healthy lives ever after. Stamped from the same template, conspiracy theories tap into an unconscious orthodoxy. They emanate from the same mythic pantheon as the social ills they protest. We might call that pantheon Separation, and one of its chief motifs is the war against the Other. That is not to say there is no such thing as a germ - or a conspiracy. Watergate, COINTELPRO, Iran-Contra, Merck's drug Vioxx, Ford's exploding Pinto coverup, Lockheed-Martin's bribery campaign, Bayer's knowing sale of HIV-contaminated blood, and the Enron scandal demonstrate that conspiracies involving powerful elites do happen. None of the above are myths though: **a myth is something that explains the world; it is, mysteriously, bigger than itself. **Thus, the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory (which I will confess, doubtless at cost to my credibility, to accepting as literally true) is a portal to the mythic realm. The conspiracy myth I'm addressing here, though, is much larger than any of these specific examples: It is that the world as we know it is the result of a conspiracy, with the Illuminati or controllers as its evil gods. For believers, it becomes a totalizing discourse that casts every event into its terms. It is a myth with an illustrious pedigree, going back at least to the time of the first century Gnostics. Gnostics believe that an evil demiurge created the material world out of a preexisting divine essence.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__conspiracy-myth.txt:3:5e55d229a861", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10008, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__conspiracy-myth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__conspiracy-myth", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "than any of these specific examples: It is that the world as we know it is the result of a conspiracy, with the Illuminati or controllers as its evil gods.

Gnostics believe that an evil demiurge created the material world out of a preexisting divine essence. Creating the world in the image of his own distortion, he imagines himself to be its true god and ruler. One needn't believe in this literally, nor believe literally in a world-controlling evil cabal, to derive insight from this myth - insight into the arrogance of the powerful, for example, or into the nature of the distortion that colors the world of our experience. **What is it that makes the vast majority of humanity comply with a system that drives Earth and humankind to ruin? What power has us in its grip?** **It isn't just the conspiracy theorists who are captive to a mythology. Society at large is too. I call it the mythology of Separation: me separate from you, matter separate from spirit, human separate from nature. **It holds us as discrete and separate selves in an objective universe of force and mass, atoms and void. Because we are (in this myth) separate from other people and from nature, we must dominate our competitors and master nature. Progress, therefore, consists in increasing our capacity to control the Other. The myth recounts human history as an ascent from one triumph to the next, from fire to domestication to industry to information technology, genetic engineering, and social science, promising a coming paradise of control. That same myth motivates the conquest and ruin of nature, organizing society to turn the entire planet into money - no conspiracy necessary. **The mythology of Separation is what generates what I named in [The Coronation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronation) as a \"civilizational tilt\" toward control. The solution template is, facing any problem, to find something to control - to quarantine, to track, to imprison, to wall out, to dominate, or to kill. If control fails, more control will fix it. **To achieve social and material paradise, control everything, track every movement, monitor every word, record every transaction. Then there can be no more crime, no more infection, no more disinformation.

Events are indeed orchestrated in the direction of more and more control, only the orchestrating power is itself a zeitgeist, an ideology... a myth.** **A Conspiracy with No Conspirators** Let us not dismiss the conspiracy myth as *just* a myth. Not only is it an important psychosocial diagnostic, but it reveals what is otherwise hard to see from the official mythology in which society's main institutions, while flawed, are shepherding us ever-closer to a high tech paradise. That dominant myth blinds us to the data points the conspiracy theorists recruit for their narratives. These might include things like regulatory capture in the pharmaceutical industry, conflicts of interest within public health organizations, the dubious efficacy of masks, the far-lower-than-hyped death rates, totalitarian overreach, the [questionable utility](https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dr-david-katz-517/) of lockdown, [concerns](https://bioinitiative.org/) about non-ionizing frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, the benefits of natural and holistic approaches to boosting immunity, bioterrain theory, the dangers of [censorship](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/temporary-coronavirus-censorship) in the name of \"combatting disinformation,\" and so forth. It would be nice if one could raise the numerous valid points and [legitimate questions](https://lissarankin.com/17-things-we-dont-know-and-shouldnt-pretend-to-know-about-covid-19/) that alternative Covid narratives bring to light without being classed as a right-wing conspiracy theorist. **The whole phrase \"right-wing conspiracy theorist\" is a bit odd, since traditionally it is the Left that has been most alert to the proclivity of the powerful to abuse their power. **Traditionally, it is the Left that is suspicious of corporate interests, that urges us to \"question authority,\" and that has in fact been the main victim of government infiltration and surveillance. Fifty years ago, if anyone said, \"There is a [secret program](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#8) called COINTELPRO that is spying on civil rights groups and sowing division within them with poison pen letters and fabricated rumors,\" that would have been a conspiracy theory by today's standards.

It is devastating the lives of tens or hundreds of millions of the global precariat. The UN World Food Program is warning that by the end of the year, 260 million people will[face starvation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html). Most are black and brown people in Africa and South Asia. One might argue that to restrict the debate to epidemiological questions of mortality is itself a privileged stance that erases the suffering of those who are most marginalized to begin with. **\"Conspiracy theory\" has become a term of political invective, used to disparage any view that diverges from mainstream beliefs. Basically, any critique of dominant institutions can be smeared as conspiracy theory.** There is actually a perverse truth in this smear. For example, if you believe that glyphosate is actually dangerous to human and ecological health, then you also must, if you are logical, believe that Bayer/Monsanto is suppressing or ignoring that information, and you must also believe that the government, media, and scientific establishment are to some extent complicit in that suppression. Otherwise, why are we not seeing NYT headlines like, \"Monsanto whistleblower reveals dangers of glyphosate\"? Information suppression can happen without deliberate orchestration. Throughout history, hysterias, intellectual fads, and mass delusions have come and gone spontaneously. This is more mysterious than the easy conspiracy explanation admits. An unconscious coordination of action can look very much like a conspiracy, and the boundary between the two is blurry. Consider the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) fraud that served as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. Maybe there were people in the Bush administration who knowingly used the phony \"yellowcake\" document to call for war; maybe they just wanted very much to believe the documents were genuine, or maybe they thought, \"Well, this is questionable but Saddam must have WMD, and even if he doesn't, he wants them, so the document is basically true...\" People easily believe what serves their interests or fits their existing worldview. **In a similar vein, the media needed little encouragement to start beating the war drums. They knew what to do already, without having to receive instructions. ** **I don't think very many journalists actually believed the WMD lie.

But most of all, they pretended to believe because everyone else was pretending to believe. It is hard to go against the zeitgeist. ** The British scientist Rupert Sheldrake told me about a talk he gave to a group of scientists who were working on animal behaviour at a prestigious British University. He was talking about his research on dogs that know when their owners are coming home, and other telepathic phenomena in domestic animals. The talk was received with a kind of polite silence. But in the following tea break all six of the senior scientists who were present at the seminar came to him one by one, and when they were sure that no one else was listening told him they had had experiences of this kind with their own animals, or that they were convinced that telepathy is a real phenomenon, but that they could not talk to their colleagues about this because they were all so straight. When Sheldrake realised that all six had told him much the same thing, he said to them, \"Why don't you guys come out? You'd all have so much more fun!\" He says that when he gives a talk at a scientific institution there are nearly always scientists who approach him afterwards telling him they've had personal experiences that convince them of the reality of psychic or spiritual phenomena but that they can't discuss them with their colleagues for fear of being thought weird. This is not a deliberate conspiracy to suppress psychic phenomena. Those six scientists didn't convene beforehand and decide to suppress information they knew was real. They keep their opinions to themselves because of the norms of their subculture, the basic paradigms that delimit science, and the very real threat of damage to their careers. The persecution and calumny directed at Sheldrake himself demonstrates what happens to a scientist who is outspoken in his dissent from official scientific reality. So, **we might still say that a conspiracy is afoot, but its perpetrator is a culture, a system, and a story. ** Is this, or a deliberate conspiratorial agenda, a more satisfying explanation for the seemingly inexorable trends (which by no means began with Covid) toward surveillance, tracking, distancing, germ phobia, obsession with safety, and the digitization and indoor-ization of entertainment, recreation, and sociality?

If the perpetrator is indeed a cultural mythology and system, then conspiracy theories offer us a false target, a distraction. The remedy cannot be to expose and take down those who have foisted these trends upon us. **Of course, there are many bad actors in our world, remorseless people committing heinous acts. But have they created the system and the mythology of Separation, or do they merely take advantage of it? Certainly such people should be stopped, but if that is all we do, and leave unchanged the conditions that breed them, we will fight an endless war. ** Just as in bioterrain theory germs are symptoms and exploiters of diseased tissue, so also are conspiratorial cabals symptoms and exploiters of a diseased society: a society poisoned by the mentality of war, fear, separation, and control. This deep ideology, the myth of separation, is beyond anyone's power to invent. The Illuminati, if they exist, are not its authors; it is more true to say that the mythology is their author. **We do not create our myths; they create us.** **Which side are you on?** In the end, I still haven't said whether I think the New World Order conspiracy myth is true or not. Well actually yes I have. I have said it is true as a myth, regardless of its correspondence to verifiable facts. But what about the facts? **Come on, Charles, tell us, is there actually a conspiracy behind the Covid thing, or isn't there? There must be an objective fact of the matter.** Are chemtrails a thing? Was SARS-COV2 genetically engineered? Is microwave radiation from cellphone towers a factor? Are vaccines introducing viruses from animal cell cultures into people? Is Bill Gates masterminding a power grab in the form of medical martial law? Does a Luciferian elite rule the world? True or false? Yes or no? **To this question I would respond with another: Given that I am not an expert on any of these matters, why do you want to know what I think?

Can you see how totalizing war mentality can be? **War mentality saturates our polarized society, which envisions progress as a consequence of victory - victory over a virus, over the ignorant, over the left, over the right, over the psychopathic elites, over Donald Trump, over white supremacy, over the liberal elites.... Each side uses the same formula. And that formula requires an enemy. So, obligingly, we divide ourselves up into us and them, exhausting 99% of our energies in a fruitless tug-of-war, never once suspecting that the true evil power might be the formula itself. ** This is not to propose that we somehow banish conflict from human affairs. It is to question a mythology - embraced by both sides - that conceives every problem in conflict's terms. Struggle and conflict have their place, but other plotlines are possible. There are other pathways to healing and to justice. **A Call for Humility** **Have you ever noticed that events seem to organize themselves to validate the story you hold about the world?** Selection bias and confirmation bias explain some of that, but I think something weirder is at work as well. When we enter into deep faith or deep paranoia, it seems as if that state attracts confirmatory events to it. Reality organizes itself to match our stories. In a sense, this IS a conspiracy, just not one perpetrated by humankind. That might be a third truth that the conspiracy myth harbors: the presence of an organizing intelligence behind the events of our lives. **In no way does this imply the New Age nostrum that beliefs create reality. Rather, it is that reality and belief construct each other, coevolving as a coherent whole.** The intimate, mysterious connection between myth and reality means that belief is never actually a slave to fact.

The wise monarch pays attention to an unruly subject, such as a fact that defies the narrative. Maybe it is simply a disturbed trouble-maker, like a simple lie, but maybe it signals disharmony in the kingdom. Maybe the kingdom is no longer legitimate. Maybe the myth is no longer true. It could well be that the vociferous attacks on Covid dissent, using the \"conspiracy theory\" smear, signal the infirmity of the orthodox paradigms they seek to uphold. If so, that doesn't mean the orthodox paradigms are all wrong either. To leap from one certainty to another skips the holy ground of uncertainty, of not knowing, of humility, into which genuinely new information can come. What unites the pundits of all persuasions is their certainty. **Who is trustworthy? In the end, it is the person with the humility to recognize when he or she has been wrong. ** To those who categorically dismiss any information that seriously challenges conventional medicine, lockdown policies, vaccines, etc., I would ask, Do you need such high walls around your kingdom? Instead of banishing these unruly subjects, would it hurt to give them an audience? Would it be so dangerous to perhaps tour another kingdom, guided not by your own loyal minister but by the most intelligent, welcoming partisans of the other side? If you have no interest in spending the several hours it will take to absorb the following dissenting opinions, fine. I'd rather be in my garden too. But if you are a partisan in these issues, what harm will it do to visit enemy territory? Normally partisans don't do that. They rely on the reports of their own leaders about the enemy. If they know anything of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s or Judy Mikovitz's views, it is through the lens of someone debunking them.

After two months of obsessively searching for one, I have not yet found a satisfactory narrative that can account for every data point. That doesn't mean to take no action because after all, knowledge is never certain. But in the whirlwind of competing narratives and the disjoint mythologies beneath them, we can look for action that makes sense no matter which side is right. We can look for truths that the smoke and clamor of the battle obscures. **We can question assumptions both sides take for granted, and ask questions neither side is asking. Not identified with either side, we can gather knowledge from both. Generalizing to society, by bringing in all the voices, including the marginalized ones, we can build a broader social consensus and begin to heal the polarization that is rending and paralyzing our society. ** **Note:** This article was taken from the website of Charles Eisenstein on [this webpage](https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-conspiracy-myth/). *Resilience Guide for Coronavirus Times* 1) Check-in so you don't check-out - [be mindful of when you feel afraid](https://medium.com/@tommccallum/fear-is-the-mind-killer-e93a1caccdc3) and overwhelmed and how that might affect your ability to balance your thinking with different perspectives. 2) [Question what you read](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mediacorruption) - don't fall for the old maxim \"if it bleeds, it leads!\" 3) [Follow the money](https://www.wanttoknow.info/financialnewsarticles).

In fact, the president has had these specially reserved powers ever since 9/11. Is there a deeper agenda behind all of this?

Chapter XI: Continuity of Government **The definition of 'Continuity of Government' is a set of contingency plans to ensure that essential government functions remain in place after a disaster such as nuclear war. In the United States, Continuity of Government plans have been on the books since at least the Eisenhower administration. The plans involved building intricate hidden command centers such as the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center built in 1959, nestled away in the Blue Ridge Mountains.** While the Government officially classifies Mt. Weather as a 'bunker', many sources claim that it is essentially a full blown city. According to GlobalSecurity.org, a respected institution in the intelligence community, Mount Weather contains a hospital, sewer treatment system, reservoirs, a power plant, an emergency television studio, and a thorough system of dormitories & office buildings.345 None of this is out of the ordinary, so to speak. It is reasonable for the government to have such plans in place. However, **on September 11, 2001, the Continuity of Operations plan was officially activated and has been live ever since, meaning that Mt. Weather and similar installations are likely in operation today.** \"A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States,\" President George W. Bush proclaimed on September 14, 2001. Dick Cheney officially enacted the \"Continuation of Government\" plans shortly after 9/11, although the Bush Administration would not confirm that this took place until March 2002.346 **A simultaneous 'State of Emergency' was declared and continues in effect today, extended each year by George Bush, Barack Obama, and then [Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/14/permanent-emergency-trump-becomes-third-president-renew-extraordinary-post-9-11-powers/661966001/).347** CBS reported: \"A 'shadow government' consisting of 75 or more senior officials has been living and working secretly outside Washington since Sept. 11 in case the nation's capital is crippled by terrorist attack. \"This is serious business,\" President Bush said of plans to ensure the continuity of government. Such an operation was conceived as a Cold War precaution against nuclear attack during the Eisenhower administration but never used until now. It went into effect in the first hours after the terror attacks and has evolved over time, said senior government officials who provided details of the plan.

The Post said the first rotations were made in late October or early November, a fact confirmed by a senior government official late Thursday. Officials who are activated for the duty live and work underground 24 hours a day, away from their families, according to the Post. The shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals. The government-in-waiting is an extension of a policy that has kept Vice President Dick Cheney in secure, undisclosed locations away from Washington. Cheney has moved in and out of public view as threat levels have fluctuated.\"348 **Serious business indeed. There have been instances where Congressmen have been stonewalled when trying to learn more about the secret operations. One example is Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, pushed to review the classified portion of the Continuity plan in a secure setting in 2007 but his access was denied.349** What can we know about the Continuity of Operations plan currently in effect? Patrick Thronson, editor-in-chief of the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, has put together the most comprehensive publicly available paper detailing the states of emergencies and powers granted to the executive branch.350 Available knowledge is naturally incomplete because many powers and documents are still classified. Some highlights include: **• Congress is required by statue to vote on the continuation of a state of National Emergency every six months. Since September 11th, 2001, it has only happened once.** **• There are currently thirty simultaneous declared states of emergency.** • The Executive Branch can freeze the assets and prevent financial transactions of individuals.

It's all over the Internet, but not on any what I would call reliable websites. I have no doubt they actually have fun doing this. These same disinformation agents will often even use pseudonyms to join in on the discussions generated by their \"news\" so that they can manipulate the direction that comments take. Because of this, I am skeptical of any new conspiracy-oriented news that comes out until I see it on a website that doesn't benefit from reporting controversial news. As an example, when ABC or the *Wall Street Journal* or *New York Times* report news about a 9/11 or other major cover-up, it holds a lot of credibility for me, because they are going against what some of their advertisers would want. When a conspiracy website reports on some incredibly revealing new conspiracy story without anything solid to back it up, I am always skeptical initially. **Many times on doing a little research, I've found the \"news\" was first reported by someone like [Sorcha Faal](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sorcha_Faal) aka [David Booth](http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=17901)**, who is known to promote vast amounts of sophisticated disinformation through his WhatDoesItMean.com website and other websites like the EU Times, another frequent propagator of disinformation stories. Yet stories like this often spread like wildfire on conspiracy sites. As a good example of this, take a look at the eye-popping article from February of 2013 on beforeitsnews.com at [this link](http://beforeitsnews.com/religion/2013/02/shocking-alien-fears-force-pope-from-office-2448470.html). The article is titled \"Shocking Alien Fears Force Pope From Office.\" beforeitsnews.com is a very popular website which sometimes reports good, verifiable news, but other times carries an unsubstantiated article like this, which I have no doubt is disinformation. If you look at the article, you'll see [the source is EU Times](http://www.eutimes.net/2013/02/shocking-alien-fears-force-pope-from-office/), or the European Union Times, which sounds like a legitimate news website of the European Union. Yet [a little research](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/European_Union_Times) shows it has no association with the European Union at all. And if you follow the link in the article where it states, \"In our 22 January report, Russia Orders Obama: Tell World About Aliens, Or We Will...\" you'll see it leads back to [an article](http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1649.htm) on the whatdoesitmean.com website, which on the home page states it is run by Sorcha Faal, who has been shown to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__disinformation-agents.txt:0:c155db8993be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10023, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__disinformation-agents.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__disinformation-agents", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a legitimate news website of the European Union.

Yet many gullible conspiracy websites cited both the EU Times and beforeitsnews.com to \"prove\" this news is true. So particularly when I hear any \"amazing\" new conspiracy news, I do a careful search to make sure there is some reliable, non-biased support of the key claims. **With a little research, I can almost always find something on a reliable, non-conspiracy website which either supports or disproves the news. **I invite all who follow major conspiracies to use discernment when examining new reports.

For the first time, the secret manipulations of the \"banksters\" were [blatantly exposed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/bankbailoutnewsarticles) for all to see. In a historic first, people around the world became more focused on exposing the greed and corruption of the elite 1% than on fighting against each other in the longstanding liberal vs. conservative divide. Divide and conquer is a tactic that has been used successfully by the power elite of the world for many centuries. **As long as we are focused on fighting each other over the right/left divide, the elite 1% who control and manipulate both sides of this equation laugh all the way to the bank.** As long as we ignore the [decisive hidden role](https://www.wanttoknow.info/brighterfuture) of the 1%, the conflicts and wars they've created continue to rage on, killing countless civilians, creating countless more refugees, and generating countless billions of dollars in profits for themselves. Notice what happened with COVID and the vaccines, the entire world became quite polarized over the lockdowns, the vaccines, and much more. People on both sides of the issues became emotionally attached to their viewpoints. They had very little capacity or interest in trying to understand the opposing viewpoint. Notice what happened with Trump. Whether you supported or opposed him, most people were deeply entrenched in their viewpoint. Those who opposed Trump despised him and his followers. Those who supported him despised those who didn't. What happened? In recent years, we forgot all about the banksters and the 1% who manipulate from behind the scenes to keep us fighting against each other. Whether you support or oppose Trump and whatever your views are on COVID, the vast majority of people have fallen into the old trap of us vs. them which only leads to more of the same. **We find ourselves more than ever wedded to our liberal or conservative viewpoints, while those in the 1% breath a sigh of relief and watch their bank accounts balloon once again.** **Consider that no matter who is president and no matter what crisis we are facing, the elite and their heartless war machine win.** Both Obama and Trump made emphatic campaign promises to get us out of the entangling wars in which we find ourselves.

These reports have involved all of the major email services. I subscribe to our email list using five different email addresses to monitor this. Several subscribers have sent messages saying that not only did they not receive one or more emails, they checked their spam folder thoroughly and could not find them there. At the same time, many have emailed who use these same services saying they are having no problems. I continue to be baffled, as the filtering is so inconsistent. Thankfully, there is an easy way to see if you have missed any message. Every message sent out to the WTK list is posted to our website. We have one webpage which is an index that lists the title of every message sent, the date sent, and a link to the webpage where the message was posted, with the most recent messages listed first. We usually send out messages twice a week, almost always on Monday or Tuesday and then Friday. So if you don't get a message from us on those days, you can find a link to our post of that message on the below webpage: [**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles) **If you think you are having a problem with WTK emails being filtered, I recommend that you bookmark the above link as a favorite. **I invite everyone to take a look at the above link just once to see if you have missed any of our recent messages. And please note that I sometimes post the messages and links there one or two days before I send a message out to the list. There is another way to stop filtering. Most email services have a way to \"[white list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_list#Email_whitelists)\" certain email addresses, so that they are never filtered. Each service does this differently, so if you don't know how to do this, you might do an Internet search or contact your email provider to learn how to do this. You can then put our sending email address of **emaillist (at) peerservice.org** on that list. I apologize for any inconvenience about this, but hopefully this information will make it easier to keep up on all of our messages. **For those who want to see every message, I suggest checking the above link every month or so** to see if you missed any.

And most important of all, *you* are a magnificent human being with unlimited potential!

And that beautiful newborn heart wanted nothing more than [to love and be loved](https://www.momentoflove.org/). I believe this is where we all started our Earthly sojourn. Yet as each of us grew, we had to adapt to the world into which we are born. We had to face and conform to the often challenging environment and biases of our parents, our family and friends, and the surrounding culture. Before many years passed, most of us even as children found our innate magnificence stifled and our heartfelt desire to love and be loved gradually overshadowed with ever thicker layers of fear, guilt, shame, anger, inadequacy, and much more. By the time we reached adulthood and became immersed in the human rat race, those dark layers solidified to a place where we lost touch with our inner magnificence.

Having found it in myself, I've sharpened my ability to see through your dark layers to that beautiful place within you that wants nothing more than to love and be loved. I'll start by relating snippets of my first big awakening, followed by how I came to serve as a language interpreter for presidents and other top leaders. Then I'll share how I found myself tumbling down an intense rabbit hole deep into the shadow realms of our world, only to eventually find my way back to ever more brilliant aspects of personal and global transformation.

Yet the answer I got was a huge surprise that changed the course of my life forever. I grew up with a charismatic Methodist minister for a father who thankfully encouraged me to not just believe, but to ask questions about everything. And seeing how others so praised and put my father up on a pedestal when he could sometimes be so cold and arrogant with me, I did ask questions.

Having read the Bible cover to cover and listened to my father and many others talk about religion, I could see no proof of the existence of God. And **being a high school valedictorian at the top of my class in math and science and having taken on a quiet arrogance, I had decided that if God really did exist, I could find him with my own superior intellect.** Yet my last year in high school, I was surprised and blown away to meet and become part of a group of born-again Christians that practiced love like I had never seen. No Bible thumpers, these caring friends were truly doing their best to follow in the loving footsteps of Jesus. Even though I continued to doubt the existence of God, I soon became one of the leaders of this group. The fact that they had no problem with my agnosticism spoke volumes. My time with this amazingly fun, supportive group was filled with some of the sweetest and most meaningful memories I have. On moving away my freshman year in college in 1976, I found myself sinking into deep grief at the loss of this special group of loving friends. Hoping to rekindle that heartfelt quality of love, I joined a born-again Christian group at my new school. Yet instead of love and acceptance, I quickly found myself being heavily pressured by the leaders there to let go of my agnosticism and give my life over to Christ. I was so confused! I wanted love, but here I felt I had to give in to their pressure and become born again if I wanted to be loved and fully accepted into their group. **As so it was in midst of this intense emotional and spiritual crisis, I gave up my arrogance that believed I could find God myself, if he did exist. I surrendered to my pain and unfulfilled desire for love and let out a heartfelt cry, \"God, if you are there, please show yourself to me!\"** Within a month or so of this cry, a caring friend I'd met at college introduced me to a landmark book titled *[Life After Life](http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Raymond-Jr-Moody/dp/0553122207/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1340412333&sr=1-4)* by Dr. Raymond Moody. I was incredibly excited to read that Dr. Moody had interviewed over 100 people who had been declared clinically dead, sometimes for many hours, yet who had miraculously come back to life and had amazing experiences while \"dead.\" The subjects interviewed in Moody's studies did not know each other.

I was incredibly excited to read that Dr. Moody had interviewed over 100 people who had been declared clinically dead, sometimes for many hours, yet who had miraculously come back to life and had amazing experiences while \"dead.\" The subjects interviewed in Moody's studies did not know each other. Before this book was published in 1975, there was virtually no knowledge or discussion of what is now known as [near-death experiences](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nde/near-death-experiences-ndes), a term coined by Moody. Yet the stories of what happened to these people while they were \"dead\" were remarkably similar. And the fascinating experiences they described were filled with love, light, and rich visions of another dimension. The vast majority of these near-death experiencers came back unafraid of death and profoundly changed for the better. Realizing that it was virtually impossible that this many people who didn't know each other could spontaneously come up with such strikingly similar, yet uniquely rich and detailed stories of their life-transforming journey to the other side of the veil, I felt my prayer to God was answered. This astounding research convinced me that there must be realms beyond this physical world where our consciousness goes upon the death of our physical bodies. Thus started my spiritual quest. And I wanted to know more. I wanted to know everything! I soon collected and devoured a virtual library of intriguing books dealing with the deepest questions about life and spirituality. Just a month or so after reading *Life After Life*, I had another totally unexpected transformation while reading a book titled *Cosmic Consciousness* by Richard Bucke. Bucke put forth a theory that human consciousness has gradually evolved over the millennia. He described a new, more expanded form of consciousness experienced by a small number of evolved individuals which he claimed is slowly spreading in our world. He called it \"cosmic consciousness.\" Those who reach this state clearly see how everything is interconnected. This made a lot of sense to me. Describing the experience of a man who achieved this state, Bucke states: \"He saw and knew that the cosmos is not dead matter, but a living presence, that the soul of man is immortal, that the universe is so built and ordered that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all, that the foundation principle of the world is what we call love, and that the happiness of everyone is in the long run absolutely certain.\" As I read this passage, I felt something deep inside shifting in me and put the book down. **Suddenly it felt as if an invisible funnel opened at the top of my head and a huge download of universal wisdom began pouring in.

Tears streamed from my eyes as I suddenly remembered a vast amount of knowledge and wisdom I had somehow forgotten. In a matter of minutes, my entire understanding of life and the universe expanded exponentially in a most indescribably miraculous way! ** What became crystal clear to me as a result of this life-changing spiritual download was that there is a collective intelligence composed of all life in the universe. I prefer to call this intelligence \"All That Is\" or sometimes just Spirit or the Divine, yet it has also been referred to as God, Yahweh, Great Spirit, Allah, and countless other divine names. I saw, or maybe it's more accurate to say I remembered, that each of us is an integral part of this great universal spirit, that each of us has a spark of Divine magnificence within us, no matter how deep it may be buried. I became fully aware that my primary purpose in life is to live in full service to this great collective intelligence of all of us. I dedicated my life to doing my very best to choose what's best for all of us in everything I do. **As a result of that one cry for help and the ensuing profound transformation, my life took an entirely new direction.** I felt humbled and honored to find trust in and the ability to surrender to something greater than myself in a way I had never experienced before. As a result, the amount of miracles and blessings in my life grew by leaps and bounds. This was a huge turning point which has shaped my life ever since. Even though I had a rich new understanding of life and the universe as a result of that unforgettable spiritual download while still a teenager, I soon realized that this new knowledge raised as many questions as it answered. Who really am I? Who are you? Who are we? And what on Earth are we doing here? Why is there so much hatred and suffering in this world? To this day I continue to ask and explore these questions on ever deeper levels. **To the White House** One of the remarkable miracles that happened 18 years after that major awakening was being asked to serve the president in the White House.

As a result of a [series of small miracles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter), I found myself in the White House in 1995 for the first time serving as an Indonesian language interpreter for a meeting between President Bill Clinton and President Suharto of Indonesia. I started working with the U.S. State Department as a low-level interpreter in 1986. I had never tried to climb the ranks of interpreting, yet there I was nine years later actually serving in the White House. **I smiled to myself, knowing that I had been placed there for a reason. My life was clearly dedicated to spreading love and to supporting what's best for all, so I knew that I was there to radiate this, and to silently invite all present in these high-level meetings to open to love and to serving the greatest good of all people. What a privilege and an honor!** By 2001, I had become the State Department's top Indonesian interpreter and even interpreted at an [important meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories#2001) between President George W. Bush and President Megawati Soekarnoputri of Indonesia just eight days after 9/11. Eventually, I invited hundreds of friends to join me in energetically channeling love into a few high level meetings at which I interpreted between Bush and Megawati. The last meeting at which I interpreted in 2003 particularly seemed to be graced with [little miracles and warm surprises](https://www.WantToKnow.info/presidentialsurprises). Both Clinton and Bush surprised me with their level of warmth and ability to connect personally. In sharing how much she admired him, one of Clinton's staff informed me that he knew the names not only of every one of the dozens of White House staff, but of all their children as well. And though I did not like many of Bush's policies, the fact the he would check in personally with me to make sure I had the water and food I needed while interpreting was quite rare and impressive to me. Amazingly, though I was interpreting for the president and other top leaders, I was never required to get secret clearance. So, though I won't go into them in this essay, you can read the engaging stories of many intriguing experiences I had while interpreting at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories). Sadly, in 2004 the government decided to require all State Department interpreters to sign an incredibly restrictive secrecy agreement. I had already been feeling uncomfortable with the amount of secrecy and manipulation I had seen in government, so with the new secrecy agreement, I respectfully terminated my contract with the State Department in November of that year (as reported", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole.txt:5:f0f92f94fc7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10044, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "them in this essay, you can read the engaging stories of many intriguing experiences I had while interpreting at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories).

I had already been feeling uncomfortable with the amount of secrecy and manipulation I had seen in government, so with the new secrecy agreement, I respectfully terminated my contract with the State Department in November of that year (as reported in the [*Washington Post*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns)) to focus on work related to my unexpected trip down the rabbit hole. **Down the Rabbit Hole** For all that I enjoyed interpreting for the government for 18 years and particularly enjoyed being able to bring loving energy into those high-level meetings, I knew that this was not my life's mission. From early childhood, I always sensed I had an important mission in my life. Yet through all these years, I still had no idea what that mission was. That all changed as the result of a request I sent out to the universe in late 2000. By that time, I had done a lot of personal growth work and felt very good about my life overall, yet I knew there was more. So I sent out a heartfelt prayer that I become conscious of any dark or shadow places in my life that I might be suppressing. The astonishing answer to this prayer completely changed my life. First, within a month or so of that prayer, a spiritual friend invited me to take a look at [a website](https://www.wingmakers.us/) which ended up containing the most profound philosophical essays I had ever read. The WingMakers concepts about [three simple principles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers) which can transform our lives helped to transform my awareness of the greater purpose in life far more than anything I had ever read. And a [most bizarre story](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakers/ancient_arrow_project.shtml) was related there about an alleged secret government organization which was responsible for extraterrestrial contact. I didn't know what to make of that. Then in July of 2001, a trusted friend [sent me a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DrcG7VGgQU) he said I must watch, as it had changed his life. As the video played on my TV screen, I was stunned and completely dumbfounded to watch 22 high-level [government and military witnesses](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) at the prestigious National Press Club in Washington, DC each testify in turn about their personal involvement in a major cover-up of UFOs and the ET phenomenon. Just as an example, one of the witnesses was the [former chief of accidents and investigations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#callahan) at the FAA who had the videotape and voice recording of a major UFO encounter. **By the end of this two-hour video, my jaw was on the floor in disbelief.

If it had only been a few witnesses, I would have been skeptical. But 22 respected, high-level individuals of the caliber I had often worked with in my interpreting could not all be lying. In that moment, I had the profoundly sobering realization that the world was not what I had once thought it was. ** Most remarkable is that clear evidence was given that the ETs are here to help us. Two military witnesses [described an event](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#2) where a UFO fired pencil-thin red beams into nuclear missile silos and disabled them. **Others described [new energy technologies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#3) being suppressed which could completely transform our world for the better. How exciting!** Even a [former chief of the CIA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/600228nytimes) and [Edgar Mitchell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mitchell), the sixth man to walk on the moon, have called for an end to all the secrecy around UFOs. Mitchell [grew up near Roswell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-ufos-astronaut-edgar-mitchell) and [had no doubt](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-roswell-truth-debated) that an ET craft crashed there. This started me on an intense quest to figure out what was going on with the UFO phenomenon and in our world in general. If something this huge was being covered up, what else might be hidden? And so began my trip down what turned out to be an immense rabbit hole. I felt very much like I had taken the red pill from the *Matrix* movie. And I clearly was now facing those shadows I had asked to be shown earlier in the year. Even more exciting, I finally became clear of my life mission! **My Mission** Diving into research of this huge rabbit hole that I never even knew existed, I quickly became a skilled Internet researcher focusing my inquiries on reliable information which anyone could verify. Within a year I had found huge amounts of [solid, easily verifiable evidence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/) of major cover-ups around 9/11, health, banking, elections, suppressed new energy technologies, mind control, and much more. All of this happened just a few years before I resigned from the State Department.** Before this, I had been a debunker of major conspiracy theories. **Only in hindsight did I recognize a few things I had seen and heard while interpreting which suggested major cover-ups. Yet then in late 2002, I was involved in a top secret meeting at the private home of Indonesian president Megawati where I witnessed U.S. government representatives put heavy pressure on her to secretly turn over alleged terrorist Abu Bakar Baasyir.

Yet to the world press, the U. S. government flatly denied this. Once I resigned in 2004, I chose to blow the whistle and reveal this deception to the world. I was amazed that the *Wall Street Journal* published a [front-page article](https://www.weboflove.org/050226fredburkswsj) on my whistleblowing which even mentioned the websites I had developed by then to reveal major government deception and more. In the months after first awakening to these deeper realities in July of 2001, I was continually blown away by all I uncovered. I rapidly shifted from being a debunker of major conspiracy theories to being thoroughly convinced that the vast majority of people in our world had little idea of how they were being manipulated by a [powerful global elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles), factions of which were intent on gaining as much power and control over our world as possible. I definitely felt like I had fallen down the rabbit hole. I scoured the Internet to see if there were any websites putting all of this vital information together in a way that any open-minded skeptic could verify using reliable sources. Seeing the importance of this mind-boggling information, I wanted to pour my energies into supporting anyone doing this vital work. I found a number of excellent websites focused on single aspects of the cover-up, but none presented the whole picture in a balanced way that could reach skeptics such as I had once been. And so it was that my mission finally came clear to me. **My life mission was to use the powerful tool of the Internet to present not only reliable, verifiable information on a wide range of major cover-ups I had discovered, but also to balance this with rich resources which inspired love, hope, and optimism that we can and will transform our world to create a brighter future.** I started in 2003 with three websites: [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info), [weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org), and [momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org). All three soon started drawing attention and getting many visitors. By 2006, the total number of visits to the websites had reached one million. In that year, I founded [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org/) (Public Education and Empowerment Resource Service), an educational non-profit organization hosting what became a network of websites and free online courses dedicated both to fostering a sense of global community based on love and cooperation, and to educating the public to little-known forces underlying the political and economic structures that shape our world. I served as executive director and manager of the websites with a great [board of directors](https://www.peerservice.org/peersboardmembers) to support me.

At the time of this writing (October 2013), the PEERS websites have cumulatively generated over 18 million visits. This great work has also helped to open the eyes of [many influential individuals](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiringmessages) both to deeper realities of which they had been unaware, and to the inspiring movement to change all of this. And even as I have explored the dark and sometimes very disturbing shadows I had no idea existed before watching that life-changing video, I am very excited to have become an integral part of a courageous global team of people committed to loving transformation on our planet. ** Dark Shadow**s Largely through my work on the Internet, I feel most fortunate over the years to have come into contact with dozens of intelligent, courageous individuals who are willing to look into the dark shadows. These caring people are not only well aware of all that is being hidden from us, they are also deeply committed to shifting our world to a new paradigm based on love and cooperation. We have developed a loose-knit group I like to call the SIA - the Spiritual Information Agency. **Where the CIA operates on the premise that any important knowledge should be kept secret and that secrecy gives power, our SIA believes that any important knowledge should be shared freely with all. We know that openness and transparency is what ultimately brings greater depth, joy, and meaning to life. ** What I discovered in my research with this group was sometimes deeply disturbing. I found that though low and mid-level reporters and editors in the major media are largely good people trying to do their best, the higher echelons in the media often [dictate what is covered](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-todays-news-brought-you-big-brother) and particularly keep some vitally important topics from ever being reported. Key media positions are secretly held by CIA operatives who can stop news they don't want from going out. The [Media Information Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediainformation) I helped develop gives solid, undeniable evidence of this. Some aspects of secret [mind control programs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) I learned about particularly turned my stomach. Yet I still wanted to learn about this, particularly as these mind control projects were a key to understanding how some major world events could be so successfully manipulated with so few people aware of what was being done. I knew that only by educating myself and helping to spread this vital information to those who could do something about it could we make a real difference.

I knew that only by educating myself and helping to spread this vital information to those who could do something about it could we make a real difference. I discovered indisputable evidence from many thousands of pages of [declassified CIA documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) that a top secret mind control program had been successful in creating a large cadre of [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/manchuriancandidate) - people whose personalities had been split so that their alter personalities acted as spies, thieves, sexual seducers, and even murderers without the knowledge of their normal personality. The program was so effective that these people would pass lie detector tests denying their actions, as their core personalities had no idea of how they were being manipulated. This may sound like it's straight out of a movie (it was [made into a movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchurian_Candidate_%282004_film%29) which I believe was based in fact), yet I even ended up personally meeting several key people to whom this had happened who managed to break free of the programs. One of my best informants is a fascinating and brilliant man who worked 25 years deep cover with the CIA and was once a Manchurian Candidate himself. Those who take the time to explore the declassified documents cannot help but have their eyes opened to these dark shadows. What a wild world that I never knew even existed!!! **Global Awakening** **At the same time that I learned about all of these and other most bizarre and disturbing manipulations going on behind the scenes, I learned about many inspiring groups and movements I had never heard of who are deeply dedicated to transforming our world.** I personally met awesome individuals who were doing powerful work to make needed shifts to bring our world into a new paradigm based more on love and cooperation. I found myself delving deep both into dark shadow worlds and into worlds of amazing light and inspiration at the same time. What I eventually learned through my network was that there is a great metaphor for the current state of our world - the metamorphosis of the butterfly. Here's a great description of the process: *The greatest transformation in human history is currently unfolding. An elegant metaphor to represent this is the metamorphosis of a butterfly. When a caterpillar reaches a certain point in it's own evolution, it savagely consumes everything in sight, eating hundreds of times it's own weight. This catalyses the emergence of new cells in the caterpillar's body which are called imaginal cells. * *At first these cells are attacked by the immune system, but as more and more of them emerge", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole.txt:10:2197fee9c6a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10049, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__down_the_rabbit_hole", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "*The greatest transformation in human history is currently unfolding.

At this point all other cells dissolve into a nutritive soup that feeds and nourishes the emerging body of the butterfly. We are these new cells on the planet coming together right now to build a butterfly for the future of humanity and the world.* The above quote is from a powerfully inspiring one-minute video, which can be found at [this link](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/metaphormosis). We live in a society where many people are almost blindly focused on consumption. Yet as ever more of us wake up, we are creating the stage for an entirely new way of living. We are the imaginal cells of a new world being birthed. **At first, the \"imaginal cells\" promoting a new paradigm in our world were strongly suppressed. Some were even killed for speaking out: Gandhi, [the Kennedys](https://www.WantToKnow.info/assassinations/kennedy/kennedy-assassination-jfk-rfk), [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/martin_luther_king_jr_mlk_assassination_video) Yet as an ever increasing number of us reach out and link up, we are forming a powerful cooperative network which is laying out the blueprint for the inevitable transformation of our planet. How exciting is that!!!** I am particularly thrilled that large numbers of the younger generation are now talking both about this change and about how we are all interconnected. As the older generation dies off and the old paradigm loosens its grip, the younger generation is paving the way for a world much more focused on love, compassion, and cooperation. Like me, these young people know that when you take away all the intense social conditioning, every one of us at our core is a beautiful, magnificent being. **Creating Heaven on Earth** The global awakening is spreading rapidly. Hundreds of thousands of organizations and many millions of people around the world are now joining in a profound movement to usher in an exciting new paradigm.

I want to know so that I can do something about it, rather than bury my head in the sand. I love the fascinating journey of diving ever deeper into the mystery of life and helping to create a beautiful new paradigm for us all. I feel so fortunate to have had a life-changing spiritual awakening at an early age which then led me not only to serve in White House, but to later fall deep down the rabbit hole and then find my way back to ever greater magnificence.

That is where you came from and where you'll return. You came here to learn personal love. Messy love. Sweaty love. Crazy love. Broken love. Whole love. Infused with divinity. Lived through the grace of stumbling. Demonstrated through the beauty of messing up. Often. You didn't come here to be perfect. You already are. You came here to be gorgeously human. Flawed and fabulous. And then to rise again into remembering. Love doesn't require the condition of perfection. It only asks that you show up. That you stay present and feel fully. And do your best. * ~~ [Courtney Walsh](https://www.amazon.com/Courtney-Walsh/e/B001JPAD16), inspirational poet, blogger, author **For more inspiration: ** Educate yourself on vital topics being hidden from the public using reliable, verifiable sources at our [WantToKnow.info website](https://www.WantToKnow.info).

Both of my parents are 89 years old. I just spent several days with them over Christmas. Since the lockdown last March, their physical and mental states have taken a serious turn for the worse. During my visit, my dad fell while walking the dog alone and banged up his face and got a bad cut on his arm. He said he couldn't get up for about 20 minutes. Thankfully he was eventually able to get back to the house where my sister and I cleaned him up and bandaged his bleeding arm. Before the lockdown, the highlight of my very outgoing father's life was going to the YMCA every day for a few hours where he would swim and soak in the hot tub. He especially enjoyed socializing with his friends there. On Sundays, he loved going to church to connect with his warm community of friends there. At that time his memory was already pretty bad and he was showing signs of mild dementia. Since the lockdown, my dad has had no one to connect with and has gotten very little exercise. He doesn't know how to use Zoom and so literally has had no contact with any of his friends at church or the YMCA. His dementia is now much worse, to the point where sometimes we can't understand what he's saying. And he spends most of his day glued to the TV. Out of fear for the virus, he wears a mask even to walk 20 feet to take the garbage out to the side of the house with no one in sight. Yet it is not the virus, but the lockdown policies that have stripped him of his friends, his church community, his exercise, and much of his quality of life. My mother is much more introverted. Before the lockdown, her highlight was taking a two-mile round trip walk with her beloved dog Pompie to Starbucks and back. She also enjoyed connecting with her Bible study group once a week. When the lockdown hit and Starbucks closed, she cut her walk back considerably and can no longer attend her Bible study. She now has hardly any contact with the outside world. My father tells me he is concerned because in the last couple months she hasn't gotten out of bed much and she's had a very bad temper, which is hard on him. I was glad that for Christmas my sister was willing to take the risk of flying to my parents' house from Denver, knowing that they may not be with us much longer. She and I were very sad to see how much both of our parents have deteriorated since the lockdown. With my dad's markedly increased dementia and my mom", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__fred-burks-parents-coronavirus.txt:0:31d75dd743ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10055, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__fred-burks-parents-coronavirus.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__fred-burks-parents-coronavirus", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "months she hasn't gotten out of bed much and she's had a very bad temper, which is hard on him.

She and I were very sad to see how much both of our parents have deteriorated since the lockdown. With my dad's markedly increased dementia and my mom hardly getting out of bed, we fear that very soon they will no longer be able to take care of themselves and they may not last another year. The lockdown has had a profound effect on this waning year of my parents' life. It's very clear to me that though a part of their decline physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually is due to aging, the main reason for the marked decline is that they both have lost all meaningful connection with the outside world due to the intense lockdown measures. They have lost almost all quality of life and on some level seem to be giving up on life, especially my mom. My 92-year-old aunt also couldn't join us for Christmas for the first time ever, as the convent where she lives is not even allowing any of the nuns outside of their rooms, except to walk in the halls a couple times a day for exercise. So sad... And in how many places is this kind of scenario being played out around the world? I would guess hundreds of millions of elderly people have lost much of their quality of life due to the global lockdown. And when our elderly get sick and go to the hospital, they can't even have visits from their family. Those who die, die alone with very little comfort or support from their loved ones. Is this really what we want for our elder generation? With depression and suicide rates for all ages way up since the lockdown, is this really what we want for our society? Are the lockdowns doing more damage socially and spiritually to all of us than the virus itself? I think we all will be relieved to say good-bye to 2020. The question is how much longer will this lockdown be drawn out? I wish you all a beautiful passage into 2021. May we find much love and meaning in this new year.

See bottom for answer. Dear friends, **I have just experienced what may be the most bizarre coincidence ever.** Below is the response I sent to a wonderful supporter named Helen, who emailed today to tell me that she was very surprised to hear my name mentioned clearly in a Mel Gibson/Julia Roberts movie titled \"Conspiracy Theory.\" I invite you to go to minute 2:45 of the video link below to verify this. I am simply dumbfounded at what I discovered as a result of this. Life can certainly be most bizarre at times. Have a great one! With best wishes, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [Former language interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) for Presidents Bush and Clinton Hi Helen, Wow!!! When I first read your comments about my name being mentioned in the movie \"Conspiracy Theory,\" I very much laughed and thought it couldn't be true. I figured you must have been hearing the name wrong. Then I found a four-minute intro to the movie at the below link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwKMxwKQjR4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwKMxwKQjR4) At minute 2:45, there it is, plain as can be! How strange!!! If you do an Internet search on my name, you will find that there is no one else with my name who is at all well known. **So who is this Fred Burks that the Mel Gibson character mentions?** Now to make this even more weird, the film came out in 1997. Yet in 1997, I knew nothing about all of these conspiracy theories, and was in fact a debunker of conspiracy theories! Before my conversion in July 2001 (the result of information I've now posted at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage)), I had many debates with my housemate Declan about his weird theories of global control, where I basically laughed him off as a paranoid conspiracy theorist. As a [White House language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories), I had been in top secret meetings and never heard anything to confirm these bizarre conspiracy theories. And Rosie O'Donnell, who Gibson mentioned along with me, was not known as a conspiracy theorist until she came out on 9/11 in 2007. For a 2009 *Popular Science* article trying to debunk Rosie O'Donnell on 9/11, visit [this link](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/4213805). How do you explain that this 1997 movie mentions both of us in this context long before either of us fell into the camp of conspiracy theorists? Incredible!!! Here's what wikipedia had to say about that Mel Gibson's opening rant in the movie at [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_Theory_%28film%29#Production_notes): \"Early in the film, Jerry Fletcher [played by Mel Gibson] expounds on a number of his theories to a succession of taxi passengers.

Thank you so much Helen. I am simply dumbfounded. You take care and thanks for this exchange of emails. With sacred love and deep gratitude, Fred **Mystery Solved: **Cosmic humor has me laughing again. I listened to that clip at least 10 times and could only hear Fred Burks. That's what two of my housemates and my sweetie heard, too, when I had them listen with no prompting as to what they were going to hear. Yet when someone emailed that it was Fred Mertz, of the \"I Love Lucy\" show, I listened again. Sure enough, **it is Fred Mertz and not Fred Burks.** This one is now solved. Sometimes there are simple explanations for things that seem a complete mystery. Thanks for those who set me straight on this. Have a great one!

And I know that other subscribers don't find value in them. I invite you to enjoy the below essay if it works for you, and just skip it if it doesn't. This essay came about when a couple months ago I was looking forward to a day of mostly relaxation and contemplation for my monthly day of silence and fasting. I'd been microdosing with mushrooms recently, taking something like a 1/10 dose every few days. This particular day of silence, I decided to take about 3X that, which I thought would be about a 1/4 dose. That generally is enough to feel something, but not get into much of an expanded state. Unexpectedly, this small dose took me for quite a ride. I was totally fine with this, but it definitely wasn't about relaxing. As my mind opened to a significantly expanded state, **I ended up getting an abundance of inspirations which I've compiled into the thought-provoking essay I've copied below.** I love that I was able to surrender and just enjoy the ride, even though it wasn't what I expected. I hope you enjoy my musings. With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) empowerment websites **Mystical musings on the sacred matrix and the value of both separation and connectedness**** By Fred Burks ** I have long known that there is something much deeper that is driving all of life - a mysterious energetic field that infuses all of us with the desire to live and accumulate life experience. I see that mysterious field as the sacred matrix from which all existence is birthed. This incredible and intricate matrix is the unseen energetic field which underlies and informs all of physical existence. In the explorations of my inadequate mind, I've come to believe that this sacred matrix was created by the source consciousness of \"All That Is,\" or God as many prefer to call it. I suspect that God created this energetic matrix as a birthing ground not only for our physical world, but also for vast other worlds and universes that are simply beyond the conception of our limited minds. As it exists beyond the reach of our five senses, most Earth dwellers don't even know this unfathomable matrix exists. Yet I've found that this infinite field of energy lies at the core of both our internal and external worlds. And I find tapping into it through my internal world brings the most profound inspirations. **The more I open to living with awareness of this underlying sacred matrix, the more magical I find life becomes.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix.txt:0:2b793be8f00d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10063, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "conception of our limited minds.

And I find tapping into it through my internal world brings the most profound inspirations. **The more I open to living with awareness of this underlying sacred matrix, the more magical I find life becomes.** If, on the other hand, I focus mostly on the external world with an eye to what's the right thing and what's the wrong thing to do, I miss out on allowing underlying divine energies of the sacred matrix to flow through me in service to something greater. By opening to and inviting this divine source to inform all of our actions, we can step out of rightdoing and wrongdoing and enter a field where we all get to play and explore together while welcoming and expressing the core divinity in every one of us. *Rumi: \"Out beyond rightdoing and wrongdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there.\" * Looking at the world with our externally focused eyes, most would agree now that the old world is falling apart. Seeing this, we are presented with a choice. **How much do we want to focus on the falling apart? And how much do we want to focus on \"the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible,\" as Charles Eisenstein so lovingly expressed in his [book with that title](https://www.amazon.com/More-Beautiful-World-Hearts-Possible/dp/B00US3SDWQ)? ** Is the house really on fire, as many of my friends believe? Is anything so urgent that we must do something about it right now? How much of the sense of urgency is our own making? I love that I don't feel a sense of urgency and have reached a peaceful place where, while not denying all the craziness in our world, I welcome any waves, big or small, that come my way. Many souls who take the red pill or go down the conspiracy rabbit hole become obsessed with the falling apart and with how dark humanity can go. This has certainly happened to me. This obsession ironically further feeds the separation game as we fall into us vs. them thinking. Put crudely, it's the evil elite vs the rest of us. Yet **by focusing so much on what \"they\" are doing or going to do to \"us,\" how much are we feeding that old paradigm?** The essential message of many conspiracy theorists is that the world is not what we think it is. It's much worse. They believe that clandestine evil and sinister forces are manipulating and controlling our world and we have to stop them NOW. What they tend to forget is that we all have choice, and that no matter how crazy life gets,** ultimately no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix.txt:1:f82df2da8ef0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10064, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__mystical-musings-sacred-matrix", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "\"they\" are doing or going to do to \"us,\" how much are we feeding that old paradigm?** The essential message of many conspiracy theorists is that the world is not what we think it is.

What they tend to forget is that we all have choice, and that no matter how crazy life gets,** ultimately no one can control, manipulate, or imprison our souls.** Gandhi and MLK did some of their best work from jail. My brilliant, talented friend Carl, for example, is like the Man of La Mancha, engaging in battles with the powerful, manipulating elite of our world that he is determined to win by force of his strong, beautiful will. Carl, what if your intense desire to win the battle is actually creating more of the old us vs. them paradigm? What if all of this is an external expression of battles going on inside of yourself? Is there a part of you that resists playing with what it's like to live life more from a place of surrender? ***The evil you would fight against forever lives inside of you.*** ***The magnificence you fear you are forever lives inside of you.*** By choosing to see the divine spark in every soul, including the elite, we can work together to expose and stop the harmful behavior of the controlling power elite while also not engaging in us vs. them thinking. We can shift from the old separation paradigm of blaming and shaming to a new, more connected paradigm, where all souls are valued even as we do our best to stop damaging behavior. The key is that in some mystical way, [we are all creating each other here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) in this divine drama. To those who have become obsessed with the evil elite, I want to send you a loving invitation to recognize the part of you that really believes \"they\" are out to get us. There is lots of evidence to feed that part. The more we look, the more we will find. We all have that part to varying degrees. How can we honor that part, yet let go of our attachment to seeing an \"us\" standing against \"them\" and consciously focus more on what best serves all beings, including the elite? **What if we focus less on \"them\" and what they are doing to us and more on \"us\" and how we can generate more love and transformation in our lives?** I have caught myself several times falling into us vs. them thinking around COVID and the elite's role in it, particularly with a few friends who see things very differently than I do.

Yet I'm committed to catching myself when I fall into that blame game and reminding myself that there is a greater reason for everything, and that everyone is doing the best they can with what they've got. **There's nothing inherently \"wrong\" with being mostly focused on exposing the darkness.** It has its place and time. And I've certainly spent huge amounts of time on this, as it has felt like a divine calling to me. It is another way of exploring the worlds of separation that is useful as part of the divine exploration of all existence.** I simply question the value of doing this from a place of us vs. them. ** **At the same time, I don't want to belittle the value of us and them. In recent years, I've come to enjoy exploring the value of separation, which I used to believe was bad. I'm increasingly seeing that separation can be just as valuable as connection. Without separation, this whole physical world would not exist. Remember that without separation, you would not be reading this and I would not be writing it, as there would only be one being in all existence. ****I believe this world was designed as a way for us to explore the worlds of separation.** Is total connectedness what really what we want? Is our final goal to all merge back into oneness thus giving up all sense of individuality? It's definitely not my goal. I love exploring the world and universe as this individuated divine fragment Fred and drinking in the beauty of so many other unique divine fragments that show up as us and them and you and everyone I know. And remember, too, that we all love both time alone - time being separate from others - and time together in connection with those around us. **I'm increasingly finding there is great value in playing with the balance between separation and connection.** I love that you are there and I am here to interact with each other. We are separate, which allows us to explore the countless ways we can connect with each other. We can honor the value of separateness while also strengthening our connectedness, which allows us ever more to feel the interconnectedness of all beings through the underlying sacred matrix.

This allows me to make more educated choices in the face of all the chaos and craziness out there. Yet I want to more prioritize love and compassion in my personal life and focus less on shining light into the darkness. What about things like climate change, the intense government and corporate corruption, and the never-ending wars in our world? Could it be that in the really big picture, these are providing souls with the opportunity to explore how they handle this? **What if literally everything that we feel is \"bad\" is actually an opportunity for growth? What if the one who is \"out to get us\" is in some mystical way no more than a lost or suppressed part of ourselves calling attention to itself? ** There are beings who I believe have voluntarily taken on the divinely appointed role of keeping us unconscious so that we can further explore the realms of separation. Without them and their drive for exploring separation, Earth and the physical realms would not exist. It can actually be quite delicious to feel separate from others, so that we can better play and explore with them. **We can enjoy the separate physical aspects while also holding awareness of how we are all interconnected in this divine cosmic dance. ** We have choice in how much and in what ways the Earthly dramas being presented affect us. What if we all focused more on responding with clarity and compassion to all involved in these dramas, including to those who are creating them - the power elite, and ultimately our own selves. **We can work to stop the destructive behavior, yet also honor the divine essence within every one of us while doing this. ** *Note: For inspiring ideas on how to see the divine essence in everyone, see [this inspiring essay](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) from my very favorite spiritual writing - the Wingmakers * I want to surrender to the knowingness that ultimately I am playing an intimate role in everything that happens to me.

Yet by an act of grace, I went through a dramatic transformation and soul shift from the dark to the light as a result of one man who I couldn't break, as he kept showing love and compassion for me even as I tortured him in the most heinous ways. I realized that this man had far more power than me and left my work to wander the land. As a result of that most intense lifetime, I came to a place on my soul journey where I felt I was really done with exploring suffering and separation. And I wanted to make up for the intense pain and suffering I had inflicted on so many. In this current lifetime my deep unresolved guilt and shame around what I did in that cruel lifetime still haunts me and at times causes me to become obsessed with \"shining a loving light into the darkness\" to balance all the pain and suffering I caused. **I know that a core reason for me creating the nonprofit PEERS was to balance my intense karma from that most intense past life.** And I feel I've done very well at this. Through my work with PEERS, I have helped many thousands around the world to heal and transform their lives in significant ways. Several have even written to tell me how I saved their lives through this work. As a result, the underlying desire to balance my karma seems to be lessening, yet it is still there. And I know that the shame of having hurt and tortured so many people that lifetime is still there buried within me. This is what sometimes causes me to overly focus on healing the wounds of our world. Given all of this,** the key question here is where do I want to place my focus now?** How can I truly forgive myself, so that I can be even more loving, compassionate, and an ever more powerful invitation to creating a more loving, harmonious way of being?

When I catch myself overly focusing on exposing the darkness, I can make a choice as to whether it feels best to explore this further or to shift my energy and explore something else. Sometimes it's valuable to allow myself to really feel these things and allow them to play out. Other times, it's more useful to consciously shift my energy so that I might be more fully present and loving with all around me. I want to remind myself and other friends who are unconsciously feeding the dark path by focusing on making it wrong to open to a different way as much as we are ready. **Earth is a place where we play out our unconscious fantasies, both dark and light. And we always have choice in where we focus our energies and attention. ** **How much can I be a generator of love, warmth, and compassion? That is the challenge I want to live into. **That is the game I'm choosing to play now. Without denying or ignoring all of the ugly parts of our world and myself, how can I step more into being a warm, healing presence inviting more love and harmony in our lives and in our world? How can I tap into the energies of the sacred matrix to support this? That is the game I'd like to play with my remaining time in this Earthly realm. **All of us have chosen before entering this Earthly life to go unconscious here to assist the divine in exploring itself through us. We agreed to forget our own divine heritage, to forget our interconnectedness with all beings that we might dive into the richness of a world more focused on separation. Largely blind to the mysterious ways of the sacred matrix and how it informs and animates our lives in unseen ways, we find ourselves immersed in a physical world that is dominated by our five senses as we explore both separation and connection. ** **This dance of separation and connection continually invites us to learn and grow. This dance inspires us to dive ever deeper into explorations of the infinite possibilities available to us in life. This is the divine drama, the cosmic play expressing itself here on Earth.

As one who has experienced inappropriate sexual fantasies, I write this as a heartfelt plea on behalf of those who are tormented by such fantasies and believe they have nowhere to go for help. I write because hiding our sexual shame only feeds these dark flames, while shining a light into the darkest shadows allows us to face our fears, and to then choose a path towards greater health and wholeness. As you read, I ask you to suspend judgment and to take a step out of your comfort zone for a higher purpose. This message might shake you up, but my sincere hope is that, if it does, it does so in a way that helps you to find greater compassion, and that allows you and all of us to step into a more fully healed and integrated world. Holding this in your mind and heart, I ask you to hear my plea. First, I plead that we find ways for those who are tormented by inappropriate sexual fantasies to have safe place to go to seek help. Second, I plead that we make a clear distinction between those who have sexual fantasies about children but are committed to never act on them, and those who sexually abuse children. Third, I plead that all of us open to talking with compassion about hidden fantasies and sexual shame, and how they impact our lives, our relationships, and our world. Unbridled sexual desire has led to tremendous suffering and abuse in our world. Untold millions have been sexually abused in a way that has done serious damage not only to individuals, but to the very fabric of our society. One key way to prevent sex abuse and promote healing that has received exceedingly little air time is to give attention and support to the millions in our world who have never sexually abused anyone, but who need and want help in dealing with hidden sexual fantasies. Many very good people carry great shame about sexual desires over which they feel they don't have control. Some fear that, without help in dealing with their secret fantasies, some day they might act out. Yet there is not only frighteningly little help available, but also laws that discourage accessing such help. Without the needed help, the intense secrecy mixed with shame around suppressed sexual feelings can eventually drive some to act out in incredibly damaging ways. Isn't that what we've already seen? Consider what's come out with the #MeToo movement and with the rampant sex scandals in Hollywood, the Catholic Church, government, and much more. How much did secrecy, suppressed sexual desires, and keeping quiet", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt.txt:0:312ce650139b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10071, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "there is not only frighteningly little help available, but also laws that discourage accessing such help.

How much did secrecy, suppressed sexual desires, and keeping quiet about transgressions play a role in all this? In our current cultural climate, anyone who admits to having a fantasy of being sexual with a child is branded a pedophile and ostracized, even if they have never acted on their fantasies. The word pedophile elicits feelings of disgust even though many who fit the definition are good people who have never done harm and want help. In seeking help, if one admits their fantasies to a therapist or psychiatrist, because of mandated reporting laws they run a great risk of being reported to the authorities, which could end up ruining their lives. These people don't know where to turn for help. For many years now I have done successful work on the Internet to expose and stop child sex abuse and sex abuse in general. I'm convinced that it is even more common than most would think. I continue to do all I can to expose and stop the abuse. Yet as one who once had inappropriate sexual fantasies myself, and as one who is a stand for transparency, I feel called here to share my own dark shadows as a way of supporting this most sensitive conversation. I ask for your grace and compassion as you read. I here want to own that from about age 16 to 32, I had fantasies about girls as young as age five touching me sexually. I want to be clear that in my 60+ years on this planet, I have never acted on these fantasies with the exception of one time at age 32, when a love letter I sent inviting sexual connection with a 17-year-old ended up causing her emotional harm. I deeply regret sending that letter and have apologized. I also want to be clear that I have never once watched child pornography. But I am here acknowledging that for many years I fantasized about young girls. The main reason I didn't act out on my fantasies is that I've been willing to face the dark shadows inside of myself from a young age. I've also had the courage to talk about these fantasies with trusted friends and share them in a couple wonderfully supportive communities. This has allowed me to stay clear on what is fantasy and needs to stay in the fantasy realm, and to focus on conscious relationships based in healthy love and sexuality. I consider myself", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt.txt:1:2f300e7ffc0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10072, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__fredburks__plea-heartfelt", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "I didn't act out on my fantasies is that I've been willing to face the dark shadows inside of myself from a young age. I've also had the courage to talk about these fantasies with trusted friends and share them in a couple wonderfully supportive communities. This has allowed me to stay clear on what is fantasy and needs to stay in the fantasy realm, and to focus on conscious relationships based in healthy love and sexuality. I consider myself very fortunate that I have not had these fantasies in almost 30 years now. Others I know have not been so fortunate. I have a warm and caring friend who once confided in me how as a young teenager, his stepfather repeatedly forced him to watch porn in which adult men had sex with young boys. As an adult, this friend ended up tortured by fantasies of being sexual with boys. With tears in his eyes, he shared with me how he so wanted help in dealing with this, but there was nowhere to turn. Even though he had never once acted out on his fantasies, he knew that if he revealed them to a therapist, due to mandatory reporting laws he ran a great risk of being reported to the authorities. As I have long had the desire to go deep in my conversations with others and I've been in many workshops which encourage vulnerability, I've had numerous people confide in me about sexual fantasies involving pets, incest, raping or being raped, sadism, masochism, strange fetishes, and more. Yet it is all but taboo to talk about such things in our normal world. I have no doubt there are many good, caring people in our world who are similarly troubled. I imagine many reading this at some time in their lives have had what would be considered inappropriate sexual fantasies. I have no doubt that suppressed sexual desire and the lack of open discussion about sexual shame and fantasies is a key reason for much of the craziness in our world. If you doubt this, I invite you to watch the powerful, disturbing documentary \"[Imperium](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/child-trafficking-documentary),\" which uses solid sources to show how much sexual secrecy and perversion have impacted our world on both personal and global levels. Major media footage in this film shows how child sex trafficking rings are used to compromise politicians and business leaders at all levels around the world. The more of us who find the courage to look into these global dark shadows and start talking about both these and our own deep shadows, the more I know that we can make a big difference in our world. By shining a compassionate light into the dark shadows of sexual shame and suppression, we can create a meaningful space for healing.

By shining a compassionate light into the dark shadows of sexual shame and suppression, we can create a meaningful space for healing. While writing this article, I did an Internet search and was most grateful to find a quality website called \"Virtuous Pedophiles\" at [www.virped.org](https://www.virped.org). On this website, those committed not to act out on their fantasies can help each other anonymously. Other supportive resources can also be found there. Yet very few of those afflicted know about this website and its valuable resources. In seeking help, many are afraid even to do an Internet search with the word \"pedophile,\" knowing that their searches are monitored and fearing they will be discovered and arrested. How sad that so few make a distinction between virtuous pedophiles and those who are sexual predators. How sad that those who deeply want to heal their sexual wounding and have never acted out on their fantasies don't know where to go for help. How sad that most people are afraid to talk about their sexual fantasies and shame, even with close friends and therapists. And yet I have no doubt that by being forced to suppress these matters, there are those who end up becoming so crazed that they act out on their fantasies and cause harm. Others go so far as suicide to terminate their anguish. We are all human. We all have had sexual fantasies. And in our deepest core, I believe we all just want to love and be loved. Can we find greater compassion for dealing with these most profound challenges and find the courage to talk more openly about these matters? I want to end by repeating my heartfelt plea. I plea that changes be made in our laws and our society so that those who are tortured by inappropriate sexual fantasies know they have somewhere safe to go to seek help. I plea that we examine the knee-jerk reaction of disgust so many have to the word pedophile, and that we instead open to compassion for those who struggle with these most sensitive and debilitating issues. And I invite us all to open to talking about these formerly taboo topics in caring and supportive settings with the intention of finding compassion and healing. Let us find ways to shine a loving light into these dark shadows. I have no doubt that this will help both to save many children from abuse, and to give those afflicted by inappropriate fantasies a much needed way to find relief and healing.

In this essay, I attempt to paint as concise a picture as I can of what I've come to learn about all that is going on deep behind the scenes in our world. My clear intention with this is to instill hope that we can change our world into a kinder, gentler place to live. This essay is a great place to educate yourself and learn how you can join in making a real difference in our world. Of those who are seriously exploring all of the craziness going on in our world, I am one of the few who is doing my best to figure out what's happening based largely on the most reliable, verifiable sources I can find. I am also one of the few who has served presidents and other top dignitaries in the White House, where I saw firsthand some of the manipulations going on. I even ended up on the [front page](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) of the *Wall Street Journal* for my whistleblowing activities. I've found additionally that I'm one of the few who can look into the darkest corners of the belly of the beast and hold an unwavering optiism and commitment to shining a loving light there, so that together, we can join forces to create ever more positive transformation in our world. I'm incredibly blessed largely through my work on the Internet to be connected with amazing individuals and groups around the wrold committed to revealing the shaodws for what they are and promoting ever more loving compassion and support in our world, so that each of us might step ever more fully into our magnificence.

By learning to recognize fear and the shadow as an invitation to growth, we can more easily open to dancing with both the shadows and light currently here on this beautiful jewel of a planet. Secret Societies and Cults We all know that cults and secret societies are real, yet few know just how much power they yield on our planet. Though some secret societies have worthy intentions, others are involved in powerful skullduggery of which few are aware. Some of the most dangerous cults use sex, drugs, hypnosis, and even torture to manipulate others for their own benefit. A number of these have been around for thousands of years, refining their ability over the years to manipulate our world from behind the scenes. To be clear, not all secret societies are cults. In the dark ages of Europe, when the Catholic church ruled with an iron fist over even the monarchies of individual countries, secret societies were the only way to keep beneficial knowledge and arts outside of Catholic dogma which would have been suppressed had they been openly shared. One example is the architects of the great cathedrals of the time, who were known as the masons. Secret groups of masons shared their hidden knowledge over the centuries and eventually came together through what is now known as Freemasonry. The Freemasons played a key, absolutlely vital role in the founding of the United States in 1776. Without these secret societies through which the American settlers could pass plans and secrets without attracting the eyes of their imperial English rulers. George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were both Freemasons, along with [13 other U.S. presidents](http://web.archive.org/web/20130828055850/http://www.usnews.com/listings/freemasons/2-presidents).

To monitor this, I have subscribed to the list under two gmail.com and one Yahoo.com email addresses. **The email that went out this morning (Oct. 16, 2102) was filtered to spam on both my gmail accounts, though not on the Yahoo account**. I have no idea why.\n\nWhat is particularly frustrating about this is the inconsistency. Sometimes a message will be filtered to spam in only one of my gmail addresses, while the other goes through fine. It's rare that one email service provider filters all emails sent by WantToknow (though this [has happened](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070407aolcensorshipemaillists)), yet I often get reports from people who are surprised to find some of our messages to them have been filtered.\n\nI've noticed that the filtering is more frequent when certain banking terms are included in the subject link like \"banking bailout\" and \"banking corruption.\" But even then it has not been systematic in a way that I have been able to discern.\n\n**There is an easy way to find out if any of our messages have been filtered to spam for you.

There's a Better Way To Heal the Earth.** [https://www.wanttoknow.info/](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) Dear friends, In the wake of recent extreme weather events, public concerns about geoengineering and weather modification is growing. Yet instead of engaging these concerns in good faith, official narratives have branded this whole line of inquiry as a conspiracy theory, often focusing on the most extreme or speculative claims while ignoring the well-documented history of technologies that manipulate the environment. Labeling everything \"conspiracy\" without engaging the actual evidence is narrative control, not journalism. And the cost is a further divided and polarized country unable to make sense of this critical issue, even though it could impact the future of our planet. Geoengineering is a code word for artificially modifying the atmosphere and environment. Take a look at the over [100 geoengineering-related patents](http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/an-exaustive-list-of-patents/) available to view through Google Patents. Geoengineering has been used for everything, from [seeding clouds for agriculture](https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-cloud-seeding-ban-farming-01571963d6d39fdce8391d24684dcc94) to creating [storms and floods in warfare](https://www.historicmysteries.com/history/operation-popeye/39318). Now, **governments, fossil fuel giants, and tech startups are actively investing in these technologies as an [attempt to combat climate change](https://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/what-is-geoengineering) without actually addressing the root causes of climate change.** *More than a dozen [private companies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ocean-carbon-removal) around the world are looking to profit from extreme measures to combat global warming - filling the sky with sunlight-blocking particles, [brightening clouds](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02046-7) or changing the chemistry of the oceans. The problem is that nobody knows how to control the unintended consequences. Some scientists who've studied and modeled the complexity of Earth's oceans and atmosphere say any \"geoengineering\" scheme big enough to affect the climate could put people at risk of [dramatic changes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89249-6) in the weather, crop failures, [damage to the ozone layer](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1153966), international conflict and [other irreversible problems](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-evidence-coalflyash-toxic-chemical-geoengineering-the-troposphere-consequences-public-health). **Environmental lawyer David Bookbinder is more afraid of geoengineering than he is of climate change.*** - [Geoengineering's Risks Need to Be Studied More](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-geoengineerings-risks-need-be-studied-more), *Bloomberg*, April 2025 Below, we present credible evidence and current information showing that weather modification technologies are not only real, but that they are being secretly propagated by multiple groups with differing agendas. **We present this as an informed call to join the growing number of scientists and concerned citizens who are raising the alarm about the need for a regulatory framework that ensures these technologies are not misused by any single government or private entity.** Most importantly, we close this investigation with a powerful reminder that game-changing solutions to heal our bodies and planet already exist-and are rooted in nature, community, and the best of human creativity.

Dr. Alan Robock, a respected climate scientist and professor at Rutgers University, played a key role in raising credible concerns about geoengineering and intelligence agency involvement. In 2011, he [publicly revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/cia-controlling-climate-geoengineering-climate-change) that he had been contacted by individuals identifying as CIA contractors, who asked whether it would be possible to detect if another country were secretly modifying the climate. He responded by explaining that if large amounts of material were released into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight, it would be detectable - both through atmospheric monitoring and by observing the aircraft or equipment used to deploy it. Robock, who has contributed to major studies on nuclear winter and climate intervention, [raised concerns](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/15/spy-agencies-fund-climate-research-weather-weapon-claim) that the CIA could be exploring how to conduct such operations undetected. \"I'd learned of lots of other things the CIA had done that didn't follow the rules. I thought that wasn't how my tax money was spent. I think this research should be out in the open and it has to be international so there won't be any question that this technology will used for hostile purposes,\" Robock [wrote](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/spy-agencies-could-be-funding-geoengineering-research-in-pursuit-of-weaponising-the-weather-scientists-claims-10047544.html). * **In 2025, US aerospace forces can own the weather by capitalizing on emerging technologies and focusing development of those technologies to war-fighting applications.** Such a capability offers the war fighter tools to shape the battlespace in ways never before possible. Weather-modification is a force multiplier with tremendous power that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns complete dominance of global communications and counter-space control, weather-modification offers war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary. **It is clear that we cannot afford to allow an adversary to obtain an exclusive weather-modification capability.*** - [1996 US Air Force research paper](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/weather_modification_owning_weapon), \"Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025.\" As the report", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__geoengineering-warfare-climate-solution.txt:1:34f4574258ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10081, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__geoengineering-warfare-climate-solution.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__geoengineering-warfare-climate-solution", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of war-fighting environments.

The same mindset that enabled covert weather modification for military gain also drove a parallel campaign of biological testing on unwitting civilians. **In other words, environmental experimentation carried out in secrecy and far from public oversight.** In 1977, the Senate's subcommittee on health discovered that the [US Army secretly conducted major bio-weapons tests](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-military-sprayed-germs-us-cities) on American cities and public transportation in the 1940s through the 1960s. Captured by the fear that the Soviet Union was perfecting germ warfare, American scientists worked with the Army to develop their own version of this technology and released biological pathogens into public spaces [239 times](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-military-sprayed-germs-us-cities). In 1966, military researchers in New York spread Bacillus subtilis variant Niger in the subway system by dropping lightbulbs filled with bacteria onto tracks in midtown Manhattan stations. Testing a bacteria that would mimic the dispersal of [deadly biological agents like Anthrax](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--anthrax-attacks-remain-unsolved), the Army[also spread Bacillus globigii, or BG,](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-hidden-history-us-germ-testing) which posed a risk to people with compromised immune systems. Hundreds of thousands of people in the larger San Francisco Bay Area were [exposed to a bacterial cloud of serratia particles](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-army-test-1950-changed-microbial-ecology), which led to 11 people contracting a painful, hard-to-treat form of meningitis.

There is [compelling evidence](https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Serratia-has-dark-history-in-region-Army-test-2677623.php) that the Army's biological warfare tests have permanently changed the microbial ecology of this region. **If the US military and intelligence agencies had both the capability and willingness to weaponize weather over 50 years ago, why would we assume those efforts have simply stopped?

Kennedy, Jr. - released information she said was provided to her by a whistleblower. This information is detailed in a report titled \"[**The Dark MAHA Report on Geoengineering: Who's Behind It and How We Stop It**](https://x.com/NicoleShanahan/status/1943432603274744146).\" According to this report, federal grants for solar radiation management (SRM), stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), and other geoengineering technologies are still being issued. The programs haven't stopped-they've just been rebranded. Geoengineering is now commonly called \"climate intervention.\" SRM is now referred to as \"solar radiation modification.\" SAI is now \"stratospheric aerosol intervention.\" These semantic shifts aren't scientific; they're strategic. **They're designed to obfuscate the truth and shield these programs from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, media scrutiny, and public opposition.** The Biden-Harris administration's mandated [2023 SRM Report](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Congressionally-Mandated-Report-on-Solar-Radiation-Modification.pdf) outlines the federal agencies currently involved in geoengineering, climate intervention, solar radiation management (SRM), and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). These include NOAA, NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Department of Energy (DOE). One [NOAA] document that was highlighted, titled [Weather Modification, published in 1979](https://library.oarcloud.noaa.gov/noaa_documents.lib/Digitization_Scans/FY23_Scans/National_Weather_Modification_Policies_and_Programs_Submitted_by_the_Secretary_of_Commerce_in_Compliance_with_Public_Law_94-490.pdf), describes nearly 100 geoengineering projects. **These include hurricane manipulation, radioactive and electromagnetically enhanced fog dispersal, microwave chaff deployment, supersonic ice nucleation, and conventional cloud seeding operations. That report was released nearly 50 years ago. Since then, both the funding and the technology have expanded significantly.** The Dark MAHA Report drew attention to a [1974 hearing](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-93shrg29544O/pdf/CHRG-93shrg29544O.pdf) before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Oceans and the International Environment. This hearing revealed that weather modification experiments had been conducted across the United States since the 1960s. Testimony from Dr. Gordon MacDonald (pg. 55) discussed the use of electromagnetic frequencies to influence human brain activity. **He described the potential for global-scale manipulation of neurological states, provoking erratic behavior, disrupting cognition, and generating widespread adverse psychological effects**.

The patent is held by Intellectual Ventures, a firm co-founded by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold, with Bill Gates listed among its investors. Critics have raised ethical concerns about a scenario in which a handful of powerful actors could profit from planetary crisis by controlling access to climate-altering technology. **The StratoShield is a key example of how solar radiation management is being developed not just as a scientific solution, but also as a potential commercial venture.** **Beyond High-Tech Quick Fixes to Regenerate Our Planet** **Author and ecological activist Charles Eisenstein [argues](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/09/we-need-regenerative-farming-not-geoengineering) that geoengineering is a technological distraction that fails to address the root causes of environmental collapse** - including industrial agriculture, fossil fuel dependence, deforestation, and systemic exploitation of natural resources. Our [environmental news section](https://www.wanttoknow.info/environmental-destructionnewsstories) digs deeper into these underlying drivers of destruction-the very forces geoengineering attempts to treat without confronting. By focusing on high-tech fixes, we risk reinforcing the same mindset of control and extraction that caused the crisis in the first place.

The existence of a global elite is not disputed, but what is their agenda? Is the global elite a cohesive group united around an agenda of global control and domination, or are there many factions within the global elite vying with each other to forward their own differing agendas? These vital questions are answered in lesson eight of the engaging [Insight Course](https://www.insightcourse.net) below. You will learn not only about the key factions of the global elite, **you will also find verifiable information proving that certain factions of the global elite from around the world have been using false flag terrorism to forward their self-centered agendas.** To balance this disturbing information, you will learn about a secret group of intelligence operatives dedicated to the betterment of our world who are working to counter the greedy factions of the global elite. These courageous individuals deep \"in the know\" are working for the good of all of us. And at the end of this lesson, you will find excellent suggested activities on how you can help to expose the global elite agenda and how you can use this valuable information to transform your own life and our world. By educating ourselves and then taking action, we can make a big difference and help to build a brighter future for us all. Thanks for caring.

Though some of this information may be disturbing, many believe it is essential to at least be aware of these things in order to more effectively be the change we want to see in our world. **False Flag Operations ** The title of this lesson is \"The Global Elite and False Flag Terrorism.\" For those unfamiliar with the term false flag terrorism, here is a definition from the Wikipedia: \"False flag operations are [covert operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation) conducted by governments, corporations, or other organizations, which are designed to deceive the public in such a way that the operations appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from the military concept of flying false colors; that is, flying the flag of a country other than one's own. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations, and have been used in peace-time; for example, during Italy's [strategy of tension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension).\" In other words, when a government or other entity secretly pretends to be it's own enemy and launches an attack against itself, this is called a false flag operation. This is done to fool unsuspecting people into believing that there is a greater threat than actually exists, and to manipulate the public into supporting war agendas. For clear examples of how this has shaped history, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/falseflag). **The Global Elite ** The global elite consists of those with tremendous amounts of both wealth and power in our world. **Like any group, the global elite has both individuals and factions which are inclined to promote their own self-serving interests, and those who are more interested in serving the greater good.** Many scholars who have spent considerable time studying this group have found that there are factions within this elite group which at times fight against each other, while at other times they work together for common goals. Many (but certainly not all) of these elite believe that because of their intelligence and wealth, they deserve to have inordinate amounts of power and influence on global politics. To get a brief, representative picture of the global elite and some of their secret societies as reported in numerous major media articles, please read through at least the first six to eight of the 20 news article summaries at the link below: [**www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocieties...**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles)** - News articles on secret societies** Members of the global elite generally do all they can to keep their existence and their activities secret, knowing that if people find out", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__global-elite.txt:1:172fafdcdd3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10088, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__global-elite.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__global-elite", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "power and influence on global politics.

If you find yourself having negative thoughts about these people, remember what was covered in [lesson one](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/01a_unlimited_potential). Every member of the global elite and these secret societies has a heart and a place within that wants only to love and be loved. **It is vitally important that we don't fall into \"us vs. them\" thinking which only leads to more polarization and conflict.** We can breathe sacred love even with those who would do us harm. We share all this information knowing that through better understanding all that is happening, we can more effectively be the change. **Operation Northwoods ** For an important example of a false flag operation that never happened, yet that nevertheless clearly shows how global politics can be manipulated, please read about Operation Northwoods through the declassified U.S. government documents released on this operation at the link below: [**www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorth...**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods)** - Operation Northwoods** Please realize that the only reason these documents were released by the U.S. government is that the operation was never carried out. If Northwoods had been carried out, the documents would never have been released. Those involved would have invoked \"national security\" to keep them secret. There are laws which allow plans actually put into operation which allegedly affect national security to remain classified indefinitely. The important question here is who determines what falls under the category of national security, and what are their motives? Key members of the global elite are often involved in developing these false flag operations and have incredible influence over which documents are kept secret from the public. Something to remember in dealing with false flag operations is that governments are massive bureaucracies and thus very inefficient in general and incapable of carrying out detailed secret plans. However, the military and intelligence branches of government are rigid hierarchies in which everyone knows their position. Superiors who give commands are very rarely questioned. Just the words \"Yes, sir\" bring up images of a \"good soldier\" in the military. **It is through use of the highly organized military and intelligence services that the global elite, working together with key allies in government and the media, are able to carry out major false flag operations.** The Northwoods documents, for example, state \"responsibility for both overt and covert military operations [will] be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\" showing that very few even", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__global-elite.txt:2:9486243abe6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10089, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__global-elite.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__global-elite", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "very rarely questioned.

Having an inefficient, at times bumbling government bureaucracy actually makes it easier for the elite to manipulate politicians and laws. And should anyone claim that the government is carrying out a false flag operation or some kind of conspiracy, the global elite and their media baron buddies disingenuously point out how ridiculous such claims are when government is so inefficient. Meanwhile the military and intelligence services are not only used to promote these operations, they also promulgate sophisticated disinformation to lead astray any who might investigate the secret manipulations. False flag operations give the pretext for war needed by the elite to maintain their power and rake in the huge profits and power that war brings them. *** Sacred Cows*** Sacred Cows © [Spyder Webb](https://universityofmetaphysics.com/dr-spyder-webb-ph-d/) *In societies with strong power elites, the powerholders' power is dependent on the co-operation, acquiescence, and tacit support of the great majority of common citizens.* ~ Bill Moyer *They're not evil. These organizations consist of well-educated elitists who're self-absorbed perhaps, but not evil. They look at the world as a biological experience where the strong survive, the powerful thrive, and the secretive control. They are the ultimate control freaks not for the sake of adoration or ego-gratification, but because they genuinely believe they're the best at making policy decisions that effect the world's economy and security. They simply want to protect their life's agenda like anyone else would. * ~ Dr. Anderson **What Really Happened on 9/11? ** For what may be one the most disturbing false flag operations ever, please watch the highly engaging, carefully researched 84-minute documentary below which raises critical questions about 9/11.

We are aware that some of you knew about the 9/11 cover-up before starting this course. We ask your understanding of the importance for those who didn't know to learn about this information, so that we can all be informed of what is going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, you've found a few interesting tidbits you didn't know previously in this material. For those who didn't know about all this, please be aware that some of us knew on the day of 9/11 that it was a cover-up, while many others became aware in the years following and have worked to help inform the public of this important issue. Some of you may still be skeptical that 9/11 was a false flag operation. **We do not in the least require anyone to believe in a 9/11 cover-up. However, we do ask you to be aware of the possibility.** To explore this possibility further, you can read and verify the public statements [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/officialsquestion911commissionreport) of some of the hundreds of high-ranking government representatives, senior military and government officials, and [respected professors](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070618professorsquestion911) who are now convinced that there were major manipulations on that fateful day. **What Does It All Mean? ** As this lesson is filled with some rather intense information, we invite you to stop for a minute and take a few deep, full breaths now. Consider breathing some sacred love with yourself and with those you care about. Let's not forget the greater perspective in all this. What's really going on here? Consider that many people from all walks of life get caught up in greed and the desire for power. Some get so caught up in it all that they end up being involved in severe manipulation of public perception for the personal benefit of themselves and those close to them. We definitely want to work together to stop the destructive behavior, **yet does it really help matters when we shut out these people and label them as bad or evil? Doesn't this just create more conflict and polarization in our world? ** If we want to be the change in our world, we can be most effective when we work to understand the motivations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__global-elite.txt:4:619ba3260f25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10091, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__global-elite.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__global-elite", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "severe manipulation of public perception for the personal benefit of themselves and those close to them.

Exploring our own inner shadows in relation to this lesson, isn't there a part of each of us that at times has manipulated the beliefs of those around us for our own personal benefit? Aren't there ways in which we have manipulated ourselves and others mentally and/or emotionally because we really didn't know any better in that moment. **What if we really are doing this all to ourselves, as implied in the [ho'oponopono material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale)?** What if by working on these places inside of ourselves, we can transform those around us and even the entire world we live in? **The Good News ** To provide some balance to the disturbing shadow material of this lesson, we'd like to introduce you to a very unusual, inspiring group of intelligence agents who call themselves \"The Library.\" As mentioned earlier, intelligence agencies around the world play a decisive role in political and economic developments through their secret manipulations and a wide variety of clandestine operations. Yet as in any organization, though some agents in these intelligence agencies are acting largely out of selfish or deluded motives, others are truly doing what they believe to be best for their respective countries. Over many decades, the self-serving intelligence agents have often succeeded in manipulating the unsuspecting public into unnecessary wars and a variety of other activities that benefit the global elite at the expense of those below them in the power hierarchy. Yet other intelligence agents who are deeply committed to serving their respective countries have witnessed these self-serving manipulations by their colleagues over the years and have done what they could to prevent them. There is good evidence that a small, but powerful group of influential intelligence agents in service of the greater good from around the world long ago formed a group called the Library. Over many decades, members of the Library have collected and archived key information on all of the secret manipulations committed by the self-serving group and the resulting effects on global politics and economics. **When self-serving intelligence groups occasionally get out of control, Library members quietly leak certain information and key documents to the appropriate sources to prevent some really ugly things from happening.** You can learn more about this from a man calling himself simply \"the German", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__global-elite.txt:5:fcdc2e06c62e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10092, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__global-elite.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__global-elite", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "called the Library.

The information this gentleman has provided about both the Library and intelligence services in general is most revealing, and even inspiring. For those interested in these kinds of things, you can find information at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/german-guy). The webpage there provides six fascinating pages of communications from this inspiring former member of German intelligence. For those who want more, a compelling summary of all 25 pages or so of the German guy's communications is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/germanguy). Though quite fascinating, this is optional material for the lesson. **Almost all information given by the \"German guy\" [has been verified](http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/12/annotated-german-guy.html), suggesting that the Library is indeed a quiet, but key player working to stop some of the disempowering manipulations of the global elite and to support the good of all humanity.** And the Library is not alone. There are many other groups working quietly at many levels in support of what's best for all of us. **Matters of the Heart ** Remember that every person in the world has a heart. Even as we do our very best to stop the violence and destructive behavior, we can support the place in the heart of everyone which just wants to love and be loved. Our commitment to recognizing and honoring the divine spark in all can make a major difference in our lives and world. Let us choose to breathe sacred love even with those who would manipulate us or do us harm. Let us do all that we can to stop destructive behavior, yet let us remember the hearts of the people engaging in this behavior. By stepping out of the \"us vs. them\" way of thinking and breathing sacred love even with those who are most challenging to us, we can create a new paradigm where negative behavior has clear consequences, yet the heart and soul of everyone is always acknowledged and honored. **As you ponder all that has been covered in this lesson, remember that there are thousands of people breathing sacred love with you.** There are many, many caring people you don't even know who support you in being all that you can be and in making a difference in our world.

Explore how these emotions are serving you. How are they not serving you? Did you fall into the blame game? Are you seeing perpetrators and thus placing yourself as the victim? If so, how can you shift this? Notice your thoughts and beliefs on 9/11. Are you already convinced of what happened, or do you have some openness that this may be a very complex operation for which it is best not to jump to conclusions. Some cannot even entertain the possibility that rogue elements of government may have orchestrated parts of 9/11, while others are completely convinced that Cheney and Bush orchestrated it all.

A Single Tax-Avoider Made More Money in 2013 Than ALL the Emergency Responders in the US** Warren Buffett watched his net worth grow by [$12 billion](http://www.usagainstgreed.org/Forbes400_2011-13.xls) in one year, much more than the $8.3 billion our country [spends](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#29-2000) on almost a quarter-million Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics. Meanwhile, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, hasn't been paying its taxes. According to the [New York Post](http://nypost.com/2011/08/29/warren-buffett-hypocrite/), \"the company openly admits that it owes back taxes since as long ago as 2002.\" A review of Berkshire Hathaway's [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000119312514078778/d656225d10k.htm) confirms that despite profits of almost $29 billion in 2013, a $395 million refund was claimed, while $57 billion in federal taxes remain ***deferred*** on the company's balance sheet. [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000119312514078778/d656225d10k.htm) does report an income tax expense.

That's over $33,000 per U.S. employee in profits and family stock gains. Yet they pay their [1.4 million](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/11/27/why-do-1-4-million-americans-work-at-walmart-with-many-more-trying-to/) American employees so little that the average Walmart worker depends on about [$4,000](http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Walmart-on-Tax-Day-Americans-for-Tax-Fairness-1.pdf) per year in taxpayer assistance, for food stamps and other safety net programs. How does Walmart spend its profits? Instead of providing a living wage for its workers, company management spent [$7.6 billion](http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/A%20Higher%20Wage%20Is%20Possible.pdf), or about $5,000 per U.S. employee, on stock buybacks, in order to further boost the value of their stock holdings. **4.

Food stamp recipients have to [pay](http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/10/20-1) companies like JP Morgan to process their benefits. The unemployed are getting their benefits through [banks](https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/01/29-4) who issue fee-laden debit cards instead of cash. And it's not just low-income households paying the fees. A two-earner household with median incomes will [pay](http://www.demos.org/publication/retirement-savings-drain-hidden-excessive-costs-401ks) an average of over $150,000 in 401(k) fees over their lifetimes. The fees are not only draining us individually, but also at the levels of local and state government.

In [Detroit](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/only-wall-street-wins-in-detroit-crisis-reaping-474-million-fee.html), financial expenses might approach a half billion dollars, in a city where homeowners can barely afford the water services. [Chicago](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-09/morgan-stanley-group-s-11-billion-from-chicago-meters-makes-taxpayers-cry.html) may end up paying Morgan Stanley $9.58 billion for a $1.15 billion parking meter deal. And in [Rhode Island](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/looting-the-pension-funds-20130926), it has been projected that the state will pay $2.1 billion in fees to hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture-capital funds over twenty years, the same amount the state will be taking from workers by freezing their cost of living adjustments. **Solutions?** All these issues have solutions: a [wealth tax](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006) for (1) and (4) above; a minimum wage increase for (2); a [speculation tax](http://www.nationofchange.org/insanity-not-having-financial-transaction-tax-1374501966) for (3); [public banks](http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/02/01-9) and [Post Office banks](http://www.bankact.org/blog/2014/04/10/senator-warrens-sensible-proposal) for (5).

Fear was once called 'the awakener,' as a healthy sense of fear could guide us to the places where life changes must be made. Our greatest fears mark the places where we must go or else risk losing our souls. Giving in to fear means not awakening to face issues that drain meaning from our lives. If the institutions intended to protect people and sustain some sense of order fail to function properly, if those given the public trust betray it, then the truth must arise from the depths of the individual human soul. Truly facing our fears leads to drawing upon our inner resources.\"** ~~ Micheal Meade, mythologist and storyteller Dear PEERS readers, Our current times seem to be a perfect storm of fear, permeating all areas of ourselves and society, and exposing deep divisions as well as wild extremes. Fear is a powerful tool often used for social division, where people (including those in progressive and alternative media communities) become trapped in bias and groupthink, people are dehumanized and ostracized for their beliefs, enemies are manufactured, and wars of all kinds are started under the guise of political correctness or maintaining national security. The tendency for fear to dominate personal and societal life can be challenging to manage. Yet our fears aren't the problem. Rather, [how we choose to face and transform them](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs) can help us make sense of the violence in the world as we seek to [make a meaningful difference in our lives](https://www.wanttoknow.info/brighterfuture). Over millions of years, we evolved to be fearful, since that helped keep our ancestors alive. Our brain and body generally react more intensely to negative stimuli than to positive ones, and our amygdala (the brain alarm bell) uses about two-thirds of its neurons to look for information that could be perceived as \"bad news.\"** Thus, our minds and behaviors are shaped by threats-real and unreal. Where has fear helped or hurt you?** Fear clarifies a threat and supports us in taking action, yet we have to use our fears wisely to see which are accurate and which are driven by false assumptions and inaccurate judgments. According to neuroscientist Rick Hanson, the misuse of fear comes from two mistakes in perception: 1) overestimating threats, and 2) underestimating resources and possibilities.

With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for the [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) empowerment websites **Run Toward the Roar**** By Michael Meade ** For decades I have worked with severely \"at-risk\" youth; some who willingly put their lives at risk, and others who find themselves at risk for reasons beyond their control. Of course, all youth are at risk to some degree, as each young person must risk themselves in the world to learn who they are at the core of their life. Now, amidst growing fears and uncertainty about the future, young people sense that everything around them is at greater risk. Young people, who are supposed to be the \"future of the world,\" can find themselves fearing that the world has very little future to offer them. Whether it be educated youth considering the increasing dangers of climate change or less privileged ones who feel the bite of poverty and the growing disparity between rich and poor, modern youth grow up amidst threats of natural disaster, nightmares of terrorism and bewilderment at the ineffectiveness and lack of courage of those who seem to have the most power. Increasingly, I hear young people asking how to act in a world that seems to be coming apart at the seams. Having found my own way through the world by studying myths and stories, I tend to answer with old tales that show how people have survived great troubles and the spread of fear many times before. **Too much fear can lead to unnecessary panic as well as a paralysis of imagination. **An old story can help contain the fear and reduce the tendency to panic and run away from life's inevitable risks. This old teaching story comes from the great African savannahs where life pours forth in the form of teeming, feeding herds. As the herds eat their way across the plains, lions wait in the tall grass nearby, anticipating the chance to prey upon the grazing animals. In preparation, they send the oldest", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__hidden-purpose-of-fear.txt:1:1665ce7ac673", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10102, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__hidden-purpose-of-fear.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__hidden-purpose-of-fear", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "as well as a paralysis of imagination. **An old story can help contain the fear and reduce the tendency to panic and run away from life's inevitable risks. This old teaching story comes from the great African savannahs where life pours forth in the form of teeming, feeding herds. As the herds eat their way across the plains, lions wait in the tall grass nearby, anticipating the chance to prey upon the grazing animals. In preparation, they send the oldest and weakest members of the pride away from the rest of the hunting pack. Having lost much of their strength and most of their teeth, the roar of the old ones is far greater than their ability to bite. The old lions go off and settle in the grass directly across from where the strong and hungry lions wait and watch. As the herd enters the area between the hunting pack and the old lions, the old ones roar mightily. At the sound of the roaring, most of the herd panics. Blinded by fear, they turn and flee from the seeming source of danger. As they rush wildly in the opposite direction, they run right to where the strongest lions wait in the tall grass for dinner to arrive. **\"Run towards the roar,\" the old people used to tell the young ones. **When faced with great danger in this world, run towards the roaring, go where you fear to go, for only there will you find some safety and a way through danger. Trouble that is faced when it first appears can be the roar that awakens a person's deepest resources. **In times of trouble or tragedy, a person either steps into life more fully or else slips into a diminished life characterized by fear and anxiety.** The modern world has begun to roar in a big way and fear has become the dominant emotion amongst people of all ages. Old folks fear that they will lose health care and retirement benefits; those in their prime earning years fear that they can't earn enough or could lose their jobs at any moment; and young people fear that there is no place for them in this fearful world where the whole thing could seemingly end at any moment. Clearly, there are real fears and wild uncertainties in this rapidly changing world. **There are many people waiting and willing to exploit the fears of others. And, the tendency to panic as part of the herd can suddenly strike anyone. **Everyone feels some fear when panic is in the air. Yet, fear can also be a guide that clarifies what needs to be risked for a greater life to be found. That's what I tell young people when they ask what to do as the world around us becomes increasingly riddled with great uncertainty and blind reactions. **Don't get caught in the blind", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__hidden-purpose-of-fear.txt:2:a3c44268f8e4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10103, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__hidden-purpose-of-fear.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__hidden-purpose-of-fear", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "fears of others.

The notion that life should be safe or even that retirement should be secure misses the point of fully living the story seeded in one's soul from the beginning. The old soul in the human psyche knows that the whole thing has hung by a thread all along. Not that there aren't real fears, but that those who are older are supposed to draw wisdom from surviving the trouble in their own lives. Those \"old enough to know better\" are not supposed to panic and foolishly add to the roaring of the world. **Those looking for security in the midst of radical change become easy pickings for those trying to benefit from the roaring troubles of this world. Those who believe that life should be predictable or that their security should be guaranteed wind up caught in the teeth of blind anger or debilitating fear. As an Irish poet once said, \"A false sense of security is the only kind there is.\"** In the end, what we fear will not go away, for it indicates what we must go through in order to live more fully. As an old African proverb advises: **When death or danger finds you, let it find you alive! **Whether it be an individual, a community or a country, when faced with tragedy or fearful uncertainty we either enter life more fully or else begin to accept a smaller way of being. In the end, or when the end seems near, genuine security can only be found by taking the risks that lead to a greater sense of life and a more inclusive and encompassing way of being in the world.

There was no way my housemate knew more than me what was really going on.** I began my interpreting work with the U.S. Department of State in 1986 at age 28. How I ended up first interpreting for Bill Clinton in the White House in 1995 and eventually becoming the State Department's top Indonesian language interpreter is another fascinating story filled with little miracles which you can read about at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter). What matters here is that until 2001, I did not see or hear anything which I felt supported the beliefs of my housemate and other conspiracy theorists that global politics is largely controlled by a relatively small group of power-hungry men who work in secret groups behind the global stage pulling the strings for their own benefit. **That dramatically shifted in July 2001, when a great friend sent me a [life-changing video presentation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage)** of 22 highly respected individuals testifying at the prestigious Nation Press Club in Washington, DC. The powerful, reliable information in this astonishing video shook me to the core, as it revealed a major cover-up of UFOs. These high-level military and government officials sharing their personal experiences of the [UFO cover-up](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) could not all be lying. By the end of this riveting video, my jaw was on the ground. I found myself shaking my head in utter amazement as I realized that the world was not what I had thought it was just two hours before! My understanding of reality was deeply shaken. I determined then and there to open to spiritual guidance and find out what was really going on. I [explored on the Internet](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufoinformation) and elsewhere and quickly confirmed that what these respected leaders and officials were claiming was valid.

I [explored on the Internet](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufoinformation) and elsewhere and quickly confirmed that what these respected leaders and officials were claiming was valid. An intriguing side note is that not long before this, I had for the first time sent out a prayer for help in better understanding anything that might be hidden from me in my journey towards personal growth. Ever since age 19, my deepest intention in life has been to live in service to all people and to help transform our lives and world through love and empowerment. This prayer was a request to remove any remaining veils within myself so that I might be more effective in living in service to all. The UFO video and other information which soon began flowing in torrents to me was a very clear and powerful answer to this prayer. As a result, my life was set on an entirely new path, which has ultimately led to me sharing this message with you. I started on a rich quest to discover what was really going on behind the scenes. **This unbelievable information caused me to have to completely reformulate my beliefs about how the world works.** If there was a huge cover-up around UFOs going on for over 50 years involving key people at top levels, what else might be happening that is well hidden from the public? I soon found that I had been much too hasty in dismissing what I had thought were the crazy conspiracy theories of my housemate and a few conspiracy-minded friends. And then, only six weeks after watching that life-changing video... I watched in disbelief the graphic images on the TV screen as smoke poured out of a circular hole in the side of the Pentagon on the morning of 9/11. Only 45 minutes earlier, two planes had punctured the 110-story symbols of world trade in New York. **With my stomach turning, I turned to my girlfriend and said, \"There's something seriously wrong here.\" ** In my interpreting work with the State Department, I had flown in military helicopters with top U.S. generals who boasted about our incredibly sophisticated radar facilities which can simultaneously track everything of significance in the skies over the U.S. from their control center at Cheyenne Mountain. One general bragged that our military could spot any unusual object anywhere in the country and within 10 minutes have a fighter jet on it to take action. What's more, the Pentagon's [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://www.wanttoknow.info/911starwars) was designed to detect high-speed missiles and shoot them down within minutes of launch.

So it was [virtually impossible](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911starwars) that on 9/11 a relatively slow moving passenger jet could penetrate our radar and other layers of defense to hit the highly fortified center of U.S. military operations, especially given that all systems were on high alert after two planes had already hit the World Trade Center towers over 30 minutes earlier. The fact that the Pentagon later refused to release any clear images from the many dozens of video recordings of this collision only confirmed my suspicion that something was seriously wrong here. **Over the following year, I dove into intensive research and was amazed to come up with an astounding amount of reliable, verifiable information on 9/11, UFOs, and a number of other major cover-ups which I previously would have dismissed as completely crazy.** Seeing the vital importance of this easily verifiable information, I began to compile my findings to share with any and all interested. I wanted to make a difference in our world and motivate others to get the word out. I especially enjoyed [summarizing](https://www.WantToKnow.info/summaries) some key, highly revealing books and essays by respected authors that were recommended to me by other researchers with whom I was now in collaboration. I knew these concise summaries would enable anyone interested to be able to digest the most powerful, relevant information without having to spend too much time. I made sure to include links to the original, reliable sources so that everyone could verify all of the information presented. I did all of this while still working as the top Indonesian language interpreter of the U.S. Department of State. I even talked openly with my colleagues and boss about this work. I was well liked and trusted there, yet some told me to my face they didn't want to know any of this information, as it was too scary and upsetting. Yet a few were really interested, with some even secretly passing me privileged information to confirm my suspicions. Then in late 2002, I found myself involved in a [top secret meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050228secretmeeting) in the home of Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri, where I saw a small piece of the hidden manipulations unfold before my eyes. I kept quiet about what I witnessed until I finally resigned from my State Department work (as reported in the *[Washington Post](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns)*) in late 2004 due to excessive secrecy demands. **Once I quit the State Department, I became a whistleblower on this incident and testified in an", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__history_wanttoknow_peers.txt:2:b35528b4353b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10110, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__history_wanttoknow_peers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__history_wanttoknow_peers", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "late 2002, I found myself involved in a [top secret meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050228secretmeeting) in the home of Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri, where I saw a small piece of the hidden manipulations unfold before my eyes.

My decisive testimony was covered by BBC and many other top media outlets, and even resulted in an article featuring me and my work on the [front page of the*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) in February 2005!** I was thrilled that the article even mentioned WantToKnow.info and other websites I managed. Not long after this testimony, I compiled a [revealing webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories) which gives brief descriptions of all the strange and revealing happenings I witnessed as a result of my work as a top interpreter, including the story of the above secret meeting. One quite fascinating and somewhat unbelievable note is that even though I was interpreting for presidents, I was never required to sign a secrecy agreement with the U.S. government. Perhaps because of this and because I am very careful in my work to target negative behavior and not individuals, I have never been bothered or seriously threatened by anyone for my whistleblowing and for all that I've helped reveal over the Internet. In fact, I have quite a few supporters in government. I first posted the best of all the information I had compiled on the website WantToKnow.info in February 2003. My web skills at the time were extremely limited. You can see a very early version of the website in all its simplicity at [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20030407154410/http://www.wanttoknow.info:80/). Yet even though the web design was extremely crude and simple, readers found the information to be powerful and compiled in a way that made it easy to find what they were looking for. The website quickly became popular. By April of 2003, we were already getting an average of 400 visits a day. The website soon put me in touch with a number of wonderful, [brave researchers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus) who shared reliable information they had gathered on various aspects of these cover-ups. As my international network of researchers and supporters grew and my web skills blossomed, I added lots more powerful information to the website. With the help of many volunteers and a few people I paid, I was able to eventually organize the information in a more effective way that was welcomed by readers worldwide. Today WantToKnow.info averages over 1,000 visits a day and over the years has received more than 24 million visits from virtually every country on the planet, including even Antarctica and the Vatican!

And the WantToKnow.info email list has about 15,000 subscribers. **At the same time I was developing WantToKnow.info, I felt it wouldn't be right to focus only on the dark, disturbing aspects of all that is going on in our world. So right along with WantToKnow.info, I developed several other websites focused on inspiring aspects of personal and global transformation.** [These websites](https://www.peerservice.org), though not as popular as WantToKnow.info, also drew a lot of interest and support. I also added an inspiration section to WantToKnow.info and invited any who were feeling overwhelmed to spend time with the beautiful and motivational materials there. As all of this information, both on major cover-ups and inspiration, was so important to building a better world for us all, I willingly used my own limited savings to finance all of the costs of starting and developing WantToKnow.info and the other websites. In 2005, I started getting the first donations for this work from people who felt compelled to provide support. One wealthy supporter said he would contribute more if we were able to obtain nonprofit status. So I contacted several key supporters about this. In early 2006, we formed [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org/) (Public Education and Empowerment Resource Service) as an umbrella nonprofit organization to manage WantToKnow.info and the other websites I had developed. We applied for and received official 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in just a few months and began drawing even more support. I was appointed by our new board of directors to be executive director of PEERS and manager of the PEERS websites, including WantToKnow.info. In 2007, we began developing several heart and mind expanding online courses. Using enlightening written materials, awesome video documentaries, heart-opening exercises, powerful quotes, inspiring images and photos, and lots more compiled from the best of the Internet, these free courses weave both the cover-up and inspirational materials into a beautiful tapestry. **The [engaging online lessons](https://www.insightcourse.net/) gradually lead participants down the rabbit hole of deception and open them to powerful material which inspires them to make a difference and play a key role in transforming our lives and world.** The fascinating story of the development of these online courses and how they have helped to transform many people's lives is [available here](http://www.gatheringspot.net/topic/transformation-community/story-creation-tt-website).

Three people have even emailed to say one of our courses helped to save their lives. The development and management of both the websites and the online courses was often far beyond my own still developing Internet skills. We used all of our donations to pay a few key people with technical know how to do what needed to be done. As donations were not sufficient and I had some money, I even donated over $30,000 of my own savings to make all of this happen. By the time I resigned from the State Department in 2004, I had put away nearly $200,000 towards my retirement. I had an additional $40,000 or so in savings. My interpreting work was part-time and on a contractual basis with no benefits, as was the part-time nursing work from which I resigned in 2003, so I had been putting away money every year in order to be able to retire some day. Once I realized that this work was my life's mission, I decided this was far more important than my retirement. So I essentially gave myself a grant of my own retirement money to make all of this happen. I hoped that eventually we might make enough donations in order pay me for the 50 to 60 hours a week I was devoting to all of this work. For the first years, all donations we received went to cover the various expenses involved, and to pay those helping me to develop the websites. Only in 2010, after seven years of volunteering full time for all of this did PEERS finally receive enough donations to compensate me at a modest rate of $1,000 a month for all my work. In the following years, thanks to the generous support of our many readers and subscribers, this amount was gradually increased so that I was eventually able to support myself and sustain this great work. Thanks to a large donation, in 2022 we were finally able to hire the wonderful and capable Amber Yang full time to gradually take over my work as I eventually stepped back into a more advisory role. Once I resigned from both my work as a nurse and State Department interpreter in 2004, I chose to live very simply. I was renting a room in a house with five other housemates.

He ... spent his later years caring for dying patients ... and fighting lawsuits from survivors of his secret tests. He will always be remembered as the Government chemist who dosed Americans with psychedelics in the name of national security. Mr. Gottlieb joined the C.I.A. in 1951. Two years later, the agency established MKUltra and Mr. Gottlieb was running it. He served two decades as the senior scientist presiding over some of the C.I.A.'s darkest secrets. The first of these were the LSD experiments. Mr. Gottlieb was fascinated by the drug [and] took it hundreds of times. In the 1950's and early 1960's, the agency gave mind-altering drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days. Other experiments involved agency employees, military officers and college students.** In all, the agency conducted 149 separate mind-control experiments, and as many as 25 involved unwitting subjects. At least one participant died, others went mad, and still others suffered psychological damage after participating in the project, known as [MK Ultra](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra). The C.I.A. ... deliberately destroyed most of the MKUltra records in 1973.** Mr. Gottlieb was also involved in the C.I.A.'s assassination plots.

This CIA-sponsored 'research' directly violated the Nuremberg Code [which] stipulates that patients must give 'informed consent' before any experimentation may begin. [The] architect of MKULTRA, Sidney Gottlieb [testified] about the policy of spiking the drinks of unsuspecting Americans [with LSD]. **Ultimately, Gottlieb would admit that MKULTRA tested an array of techniques and substances on dozens of unsuspecting people, and there may well have been hundreds. Gottlieb ... personally spiked the drinks of scientists working with him.** An Army scientist, [Frank Olson](http://www.frankolsonproject.org/), was given a massive dose and ... ended up jumping through the 10th-floor window of a Manhattan hotel. Gottlieb asked a government narcotics agent named [George White](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/mission_mind_control_documentary) to begin testing hallucinogens on unsuspecting citizens. White, a hard-drinking, fast-living man ... began dosing unwitting guinea pigs in autumn 1952. He would later, with Gottlieb's approval, set up safe houses in New York and San Francisco where he played host to prostitutes, drug dealers and their customers and handed the unsuspecting guests drinks laced with LSD. In a 1953 memo to a researcher, Gottlieb gave an indication of the kinds of mind control issues he was interested in -- for both offensive and defensive purposes: 'Disturbance of memory; discrediting by aberrant behaviour; alteration of sex patterns; eliciting of information.' Gottlieb and his boss, Richard Helms -- in an unprecedented and controversial move -- ordered all MKULTRA records destroyed in 1973. A few [financial records survived](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse). **Note:** Though the CIA denies that mind control techniques were successful, an abundance of evidence suggests otherwise.

It turned out to be Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. I was told I would be dead in four to six months. Today I am in that rare coterie of people who have survived this long with the disease. But I did not foresee that after having dedicated myself for 40 years to a life of the law, including more than two decades as a New York State judge, my quest for ameliorative and palliative care would lead me to marijuana. My survival has demanded an enormous price, including months of chemotherapy, radiation hell and brutal surgery. Inhaled marijuana is the only medicine that gives me some relief from nausea, stimulates my appetite, and makes it easier to fall asleep. The oral synthetic substitute, Marinol, prescribed by my doctors, was useless. **Rather than watch the agony of my suffering, friends have chosen, at some personal risk, to provide the substance. I find a few puffs of marijuana before dinner gives me ammunition in the battle to eat. A few more puffs at bedtime permits desperately needed sleep. This is not a law-and-order issue; it is a medical and a human rights issue.** Being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I am receiving the absolute gold standard of medical care. But doctors cannot be expected to do what the law prohibits, even when they know it is in the best interests of their patients. When palliative care is understood as a fundamental human and medical right, marijuana for medical use should be beyond controversy. **Note:** The author is Gustin L. Reichbach, who is a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. **Why I changed my mind on weed** **2013-08-09, CNN** [http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/08/health/gupta-changed-mind-marijuana/index.html](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/08/health/gupta-changed-mind-marijuana/index.html) Over the last year, I [CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta] have been working on a new documentary called \"Weed.\" The title \"Weed\" may sound cavalier, but the content is not. I traveled around the world to interview medical leaders, experts, growers and patients. I spoke candidly to them, asking tough questions. What I found was stunning. Long before I began this project, I had steadily reviewed the scientific literature on medical marijuana from the United States and thought it was fairly unimpressive. Reading these papers five years ago, it was hard to make a case for medicinal marijuana. I even wrote about this in a *TIME* magazine article, back in 2009, titled \"Why I would Vote No on Pot.\" Well, I am here to apologize. I apologize because I didn't look hard enough, until now.

I didn't look far enough. I didn't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis. I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof. Surely, they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have \"no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse.\" They didn't have the science to support that claim, and **I now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true. It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works.** **Note:** This article was authored by CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. **'Magic Mushrooms' Can Improve Psychological Health Long Term** **2011-06-16, *Time* Magazine** [http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/16/magic-mushrooms-can-improve-psychologic...](http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/16/magic-mushrooms-can-improve-psychological-health-long-term/) The psychedelic drug in magic mushrooms may have lasting medical and spiritual benefits, according to new research from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The mushroom-derived hallucinogen, called psilocybin, is known to trigger transformative spiritual states, but at high doses it can also result in \"bad trips\" marked by terror and panic. \"The important point here is that we found the sweet spot where we can optimize the positive persistent effects and avoid some of the fear and anxiety that can occur and can be quite disruptive,\" says lead author Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins. Giffiths' study involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46. Nearly all the volunteers were college graduates and 78% participated regularly in religious activities; all were interested in spiritual experience. Fourteen months after participating in the study, 94% of those who received the drug said the experiment was one of the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives; 39% said it was the single most meaningful experience. **The participants themselves were not the only ones who saw the benefit from the insights they gained: their friends, family member and colleagues also reported that the psilocybin experience had made the participants calmer, happier and kinder**. **Did the CIA test LSD in the New York City subway system?** **2010-03-13, *New York Post*** [http://nypost.com/2010/03/14/did-the-cia-test-lsd-in-the-new-york-city-subway-system](http://nypost.com/2010/03/14/did-the-cia-test-lsd-in-the-new-york-city-subway-system/) On Nov. 28, 1953, Frank Olson, a ... 42-year-old government scientist, plunged to his death from room 1018A in New York's Statler Hotel.

[Twenty-two] years later, the Rockefeller Commission report was released, detailing a litany of domestic abuses committed by the CIA. The ugly truth emerged: Olson's death was the result of his having been surreptitiously dosed with LSD days earlier by his colleagues. The belated 1975 [admission] ... generated more interest into a series of wildly implausible \"mind control\" experiments on an unsuspecting populace over three decades. Much of this plot unfolded here, in New York, according to H.P. Albarelli Jr., author of [*A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA's Secret Cold War Experiments*](http://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Mistake-Murder-Secret-Experiments/dp/0977795373/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269708931&sr=1-1). Albarelli spent more than a decade sifting through more than 100,000 pages of government documents and his most startling chestnut might be his claim that **the intelligence community conducted aerosol tests of LSD inside the New York City subway system. \"The experiment was pretty shocking - shocking that the CIA and the Army would release LSD like that, among innocent unwitting folks,\"** Albarelli told *The Post*. An Olson colleague, Dr. Henry Eigelsbach, confirmed to Albarelli that the LSD subway test did, in fact, occur in November 1950, albeit on a smaller scale than first planned. Little, however, is known about the test - what line, how many people and what happened. **Note: **For lots more reliable information on CIA mind control experiments, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) and [here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation). **John K.

At least one participant died when he jumped out of a 10th-floor window in a hotel; others claimed to have suffered serious psychological damage. Mr. Vance learned about MKULTRA in the spring of 1963 during a wide-ranging inspector general survey of the agency's technical services division. The inspector general's report said: \"The concepts involved in manipulating human behavior are found by many people both within and outside the agency to be distasteful and unethical.\" MKULTRA came to public light in 1977 as a result of hearings conducted by a Senate committee on intelligence chaired by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho). **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra).

He was nearly 70 by the time he became known as the Godfather of Ecstasy, a title that made it sound like he had invented MDMA, which he hadn't: Shulgin had only introduced the drug to west coast psychotherapists in the late 70s. But, he had created more than 200 psychoactive compounds in his home laboratory, tested them all on himself and his wife and written about them in a 1991 book titled *[Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved](http://www.amazon.com/Pihkal-Chemical-Story-Alexander-Shulgin/dp/0963009605/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402254038&sr=1-1)*. The combination of the book, **his association with ecstasy, and that drug's burgeoning popularity made him a hugely celebrated figure. Shulgin thought all drugs should be legalised, but he seemed about as far removed from the bug-eyed psychedelic proselyte of popular myth as it was possible to get.** His writing was measured, calm and witty. He did not court the attention of the rave generation. If anything, he seemed faintly exasperated by the way MDMA was being used. \"Go banging about with a psychedelic drug for a Saturday night turn-on, and you can get into a really bad place, psychologically,\" he had warned. Later he was to lament that MDMA had been \"sidetracked into the Yahoo generation\". None of the drugs Shulgin invented became as famous as the one he didn't. In the late '90s, there was talk that a compound called 2CB was \"the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__illegal-drugs-good-evil.txt:5:585ca7e126dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10121, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__illegal-drugs-good-evil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__illegal-drugs-good-evil", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "If anything, he seemed faintly exasperated by the way MDMA was being used. \"Go banging about with a psychedelic drug for a Saturday night turn-on, and you can get into a really bad place, psychologically,\" he had warned.

Many are desperate, pleading for treatment and willing to travel to get it. The soldiers have no interest in traditional talking cures or prescription drugs that have given them little relief. They are lining up to try an alternative: MDMA, better known as Ecstasy, a party drug that surfaced in the 1980s and '90s that can induce pulses of euphoria and a radiating affection. Government regulators criminalized the drug in 1985, placing it on a list of prohibited substances that includes heroin and LSD. But in recent years, regulators have licensed a small number of labs to produce MDMA for research purposes. **In a paper posted online ... by the *Journal of Psychopharmacology*, Michael and Ann Mithoefer, the husband-and-wife team offering the treatment - which combines psychotherapy with a dose of MDMA - write that they found 15 of 21 people who recovered from severe post-traumatic stress in the therapy in the early 2000s reported minor to virtually no symptoms today.** The Mithoefers - he is a psychiatrist and she is a nurse - collaborated on the study with researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina and the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. The patients in this group included mostly rape victims, and experts familiar with the work cautioned that it was preliminary, based on small numbers, and its applicability to war trauma entirely unknown. **Note:** For the paper on this remarkable study published published online in the *Journal of Psychopharmacology*, [click here](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/mithoefer_etal_2012_ltfu.pdf). **Marijuana Fights Cancer and Helps Manage Side Effects, Researchers Find** **2012-09-06, The Daily Beast/*Newsweek*** [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/06/marijuana-fights-cancer-and-...](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/06/marijuana-fights-cancer-and-helps-manage-side-effects-researchers-find.html) **Mounting evidence shows 'cannabinoids' in marijuana slow cancer growth, inhibit formation of new blood cells that feed a tumor, and help manage pain, fatigue, nausea, and other side effects.** Peer-reviewed studies in several countries ... show that THC and other marijuana-derived compounds, known as \"cannabinoids,\" are effective not only for cancer-symptom management (nausea, pain, loss of appetite,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__illegal-drugs-good-evil.txt:6:6bb7fe9d7034", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10122, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__illegal-drugs-good-evil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__illegal-drugs-good-evil", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "online in the *Journal of Psychopharmacology*, [click here](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/mithoefer_etal_2012_ltfu.pdf). **Marijuana Fights Cancer and Helps Manage Side Effects, Researchers Find** **2012-09-06, The Daily Beast/*Newsweek*** [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/06/marijuana-fights-cancer-and-...](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/06/marijuana-fights-cancer-and-helps-manage-side-effects-researchers-find.html) **Mounting evidence shows 'cannabinoids' in marijuana slow cancer growth, inhibit formation of new blood cells that feed a tumor, and help manage pain, fatigue, nausea, and other side effects.** Peer-reviewed studies in several countries ... show that THC and other marijuana-derived compounds, known as \"cannabinoids,\" are effective not only for cancer-symptom management (nausea, pain, loss of appetite, fatigue), they also confer a direct antitumoral effect. A team of Spanish scientists led by Manuel Guzman conducted the first clinical trial assessing the antitumoral action of THC on human beings. THC treatment was associated with significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation in every test subject. Harvard University scientists reported that THC slows tumor growth in common lung cancer and \"significantly reduces the ability of the cancer to spread.\" What's more ... THC selectively targets and destroys tumor cells while leaving healthy cells unscathed. Conventional chemotherapy drugs, by contrast, are highly toxic; they indiscriminately damage the brain and body. There is mounting evidence ... that cannabinoids \"represent a new class of anticancer drugs that retard cancer growth, inhibit angiogenesis [the formation of new blood cells that feed a tumor] and the metastatic spreading of cancer cells.\" **Within the medical science community, the discovery that cannabinoids have anti-tumoral properties is increasingly recognized as a seminal advancement in cancer therapeutics.** **Note:** Yet treatment with cannabinoids continues to be largely illegal in the US.

So why isn't it widely used? The drug, derived from the root of a central African plant called iboga, had been used for centuries by the Bwiti people of Gabon and Cameroon, as part of a tribal initiation ceremony. But it wasn't until 1962, when a young heroin addict called Howard Lotsof stumbled upon ibogaine, that its value as an addiction treatment was uncovered. **Lotsof took it to get high but when the hallucinogenic effects wore off, he realised he no longer had the compulsion to take heroin. He became convinced that he had found the solution to addiction and dedicated much of his life to promoting [ibogaine](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ibogaine/ibogaine.shtml) as a treatment.** Ibogaine affects the brain in two distinct ways.

On 16 August 1951, postman Leon Armunier was doing his rounds in the southern French town of Pont-Saint-Esprit when he was suddenly overwhelmed by nausea and wild hallucinations. \"It was terrible. I had the sensation of shrinking and shrinking, and the fire and the serpents coiling around my arms,\" he remembers. Leon, now 87, fell off his bike and was taken to the hospital in Avignon. Over the coming days, dozens of other people in the town fell prey to similar symptoms. Doctors at the time concluded that bread at one of the town's bakeries had become contaminated by ergot, a poisonous fungus that occurs naturally on rye. That view remained largely unchallenged until 2009, when an American investigative journalist, Hank Albarelli, revealed a CIA document labelled: \"Re: Pont-Saint-Esprit and F. Olson Files. SO Span/France Operation file, inclusive Olson. Intel files. Hand carry to Belin - tell him to see to it that these are buried.\" **F. Olson is Frank Olson, a CIA scientist who, at the time of the Pont St Esprit incident, led research for the agency into the drug LSD. David Belin, meanwhile, was executive director of the Rockefeller Commission created by the White House in 1975 to investigate abuses carried out worldwide by the CIA.** Albarelli believes the Pont-Saint-Esprit and F. Olson Files, mentioned in the document, would show - if they had not been \"buried\" - that the CIA was experimenting on the townspeople, by dosing them with LSD. **Note:** Frank Olson later had his drink spiked with LSD and allegedly committed suicide shortly thereafter. Yet many believe he was \"suicided\" as he was having misgivings about his involvement in this program and considering spilling the beans, as reported in [this news article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-cia-accused-coverup-military-scientists-1953-fatal-fall).

It defines hemp as an agricultural crop rather than a drug - and effectively frees American farmers to grow it for the first time in almost 60 years. For 20 years, legislators, farmers, hippies, activists, agency heads and agronomists have worked to recast hemp as a game-changer, an American cash crop that could jump-start the country's next economic revival. Colorado, Vermont and Kentucky wasted no time launching their industrial hemp research and the pilot programs provided for in the farm bill. In an obscure notice dated April 16th, the USDA alerted state and county officials that farmers in states that [approved] hemp production (15 so far) could now include hemp acreage in their crop reports. The floodgates have opened. The current American hemp market is estimated at nearly half a billion dollars, with hemp's oil, seed and fiber used in food, carbon-negative building materials, and automobile composites that are already inside millions of cars. **Hemp cultivation is ... as old as the country itself. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew it, hemp was once legal tender, and several drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written on hemp paper. During WWII, American farmers were paid to grow it, cultivating more than 150 million pounds of industrial hemp to support the American war effort.** **Note:** Hemp is derived from the cannabis sativa plant, which also produces marijuana. **Can LSD cure depression?** **2012-09-25, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9565026/Can-LSD-cure-depression.html](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9565026/Can-LSD-cure-depression.html) Until recently, prescribing Ecstasy, mescaline or magic mushrooms has been a guaranteed way for a psychiatrist to lose his research funding, his job or even his liberty. But now, scientists are beginning to suspect that such illegal drugs may be the key to treating a range of intractable illnesses, from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression. These chemicals [include] the psychedelic drugs psilocybin, derived from magic mushrooms, and LSD, as well as Ecstasy. A series of studies performed in Britain and the US is beginning to tease out their potential benefits. \"People become very emotionally tender on Ecstasy, which makes you more responsive to psychotherapy,\" explains Dr Robin Carhart-Harris.

Earlier studies have made surprising discoveries about what psilocybin, a class-A drug in Britain, was doing in the brain. These in turn could lead to new treatments for depression and agonising cluster headaches. This may all sound radical, or even dangerous - yet **half a century ago, research into the effects of psychedelic drugs was widespread and respectable. More than 1,000 papers were published looking at ways that psychiatrists could help patients with hallucinogenic chemicals.** **Doctors consider using street drugs to ease suffering of dying patients** **2012-04-24, Fox News** [http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/04/24/doctors-consider-using-street-drugs-...](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/04/24/doctors-consider-using-street-drugs-to-ease-suffering-dying-patients/) Recent studies at Harvard, U.C.L.A. [and] John Hopkins have now made it plain that doctors should [soon] be free to offer illicit drugs to patients who are terminally ill, in order to ease their emotional suffering. At Harvard, Dr. John Halpern ... tested MDMA (the street drug Ecstasy) to determine if it would ease the anxieties in two patients with terminal cancer. At U.C.L.A. and Hopkins, Drs. Charles Grob and Roland Griffiths used psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) to help cancer patients past their paralyzing, debilitating fears. **The results are reportedly consistently good. In many cases, patients are able to cope with their physical pain and psychological turmoil better than before. Some, no doubt, feel the drugs opened doors of perception previously closed to them, allowing them to make peace with their lives and the impending end of their lives.** Recent data also show that low doses of the street drug Special K (ketamine), when slowly infused via IV, can instantly [relieve] major depression ... in many patients.

Dr. Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor- UCLA Medical Center and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute ... and his colleagues studied 12 patients, ages 36 to 58, with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety resulting from their diagnoses. The patients were given a relatively low dose of psilocybin, 0.2 milligram per kilogram of body weight. Nonetheless, the team reported in the *Archives of General Psychiatry*, **all patients reported a significant improvement in mood for at least two weeks after the psilocybin treatment and up to a six-month improvement on a scale that measures depression and anxiety. Most also reported a decreased need for narcotic pain relievers. No adverse reactions were observed.** These types of patients normally do not respond well to psychological therapy, Grob said, but his study showed that the drug has \"great promise for alleviating anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms.\" **Note:** For many hope-inspiring reports from reliable sources on new cancer coping strategies and possible cures, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/cancercuresnewsarticles). **Learning from a '50s Housewife on Acid** **2011-01-18, ABC News** [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/1950s-housewife-acid/story?id=12640926](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/1950s-housewife-acid/story?id=12640926) A video [that went viral] featured footage of a mid-1950s housewife on an acid trip during an LSD experiment.

The woman, who is identified only as the wife of a hospital employee, is in her late 20s or early 30s and appears fairly typical of her time. LSD was a legal pharmaceutical drug until 1966. Journalist Don Lattin says he came across the video in the archives of philosopher Gerald Heard while researching a group biography on him, the British writer Aldous Huxley, and Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. In the video that Lattin [posted online](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/g/lsd-1950s-housewife.php), [the housewife] is clearly under the influence and appears to be rather enjoying it. She says: \"Everything is alive. This is reality. I wish you could see it. I wish I could talk in technicolor.\" \"This shows that very early on in the 1950s, researchers were aware that there were possible beneficial uses, rather than military or more nefarious uses,\" he says. **In the early 1950s and into the '60s the Army and CIA secretly funded a lot of research to see if LSD could be used as a chemical weapon or a truth serum, says Lattin. But Cohen and his ilk were pursuing a different line of study.** **They wanted to understand how it works, how the mind works and the connection between the psychotic state and a spiritually enlightened state.\"** Indeed, Wilson, the AA co-founder, did a fair amount of LSD in the 50s , says Lattin. \"This surprises people, but he wasn't doing it to get high,\" he adds. \"It was to achieve that spiritual awakening.\" **Note:** The video of this session is quite inspiring.

I will show here that the statistical odds against several key mass murders happening the way they did are greater than a billion to one. You have better odds of winning the lottery or being struck by lightning than that. **In reporting on many major mass murder and terrorist events in the US and Europe in recent years, including the Paris massacre and killings in San Bernardino, CA, respected media sources have revealed that by \"coincidence\" a drill was being held the same day and in the same city of the event. Not only that, the drills were practicing for what actually happened.** As a result of these multiple, amazing coincidences, those involved in these drills were then able to immediately go from the practice drill to secure and control the scene of the actual event. I will show that the astronomical odds against this being coincidence suggest that almost certainly something else is happening here. After presenting the undeniable evidence, I will go into the who, how, and why on these drills. This information may be disturbing for some, as nefarious forces hidden from the public are revealed. Yet if we choose to close our eyes to all of this, these forces will be allowed to grow and fester. If, instead, we shine light into these shadows, we can all come together to reveal what is going on and choose a different, more harmonious path for all of us. **The evidence** Consider the March 15, 2019 mosque shooting in New Zealand. A [*New York Times*article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/asia/new-zealand-shootings-police-response.html) reported that, \"The police said a special armed tactical unit ... happened to be in a training session in the city center and wearing their gear,\" so they were able to arrive on the scene just 10 minutes after the incident. Then there was the \"coincidence\" regarding the 2015 San Bernardino shootings. [According to NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/12/04/458426970/reformers-fear-police-will-revisit-militarized-mindset-after-mass-shootings), \"On the day of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the city's SWAT team was training for an active shooter situation just minutes away from the scene of the massacre.\" Less than a month before that shooting were the November Paris attacks on Friday the 13th (another interesting coincidence). The [UK's*Guardian*reported](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/normality-inches-back-at-french-hospitals-after-facing-surgery-of-war), \"In an eerie coincidence, last Friday morning Paris's ambulance, fire services and hospitals had rehearsed a scenario based on a Charlie Hebdo-style attack, with more than 100 casualties from shooting. Hours later this scenario happened for real.\" **This same coincidence also happened on the day of 9/11 in Washington, DC. As [reported by the Associated Press](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-federal-agency-planned-planecrashingintobuilding-drill-sept-11), \"In what the government describes as a bizarre coincidence, one U.S. intelligence agency was planning an exercise last Sept. 11 in which an errant", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:0:6c9296a3bc2b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10130, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "\"In an eerie coincidence, last Friday morning Paris's ambulance, fire services and hospitals had rehearsed a scenario based on a Charlie Hebdo-style attack, with more than 100 casualties from shooting.

Here is the verbatim text of [a BBC radio interview](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050713londonbombingcoverup) with Peter Power, a former Scotland Yard Official who was managing the drill that day: POWER: At half past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off **precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning**, so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up right now. HOST: To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this, and it happened while you were running the exercise? POWER: Precisely, and it was about half past nine this morning. We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons I don't want to reveal their name, but they're listening and they'll know it. And we had a room full of crisis managers for the first time they'd met. And so within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision that this is the real one, and so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking. ** So the manager of a team which was training for a subway terrorist attack that very morning states the bombings unfolded at the very same stations where they had been training. **What are the statistical odds of that happening by chance? **The probability** The London Tube (aka the Underground) serves [270 stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground). If there had been just one bombing at one of the stations, the probability that a training drill would be held at precisely that station are therefore 270 to one. Now if we add a bombing at a second station, the chances that a second team would be training at that exact station are now 269 to one (270 minus the first station). The odds that both trainings would take place at exactly the two stations where the bombings took place are now one in 270 X 269 divided by two, which equals 36,315. If we add a third station, the odds are 268 to one that they would choose that precise station", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:1:e71515d996ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10131, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "add a bombing at a second station, the chances that a second team would be training at that exact station are now 269 to one (270 minus the first station). The odds that both trainings would take place at exactly the two stations where the bombings took place are now one in 270 X 269 divided by two, which equals 36,315. If we add a third station, the odds are 268 to one that they would choose that precise station for a third training. As there are 3 x 2 x 1 possible orders in which we could have chosen the same three stations, we have to divide the result by (3 x 2 x 1) to avoid overcounting. So the odds that drills were being carried out by coincidence at the exact three stations where the three bombings occurred would be one in 270 X 269 X 268, which equals 19,464,840. We then divide by six possible orders, for a final result of 3,244,140 or over three million to one. Hmmmmmm... Now on top of that, we have to ask what are the chances that they would be running a multiple-site drill on subway bombings on exactly the same day that the event happened? I can guarantee that before the event, they weren't running subway bombing drills every month. It was probably more like once a year at the most. So if it was once a year, the odds that they would choose to do the drills on the precise day of the actual bombings are 3,244,140 X 365, which equals 1,184,111,100 or roughly one billion to one. Do you think we're stretching the bounds of chance here? Granted that both the alleged bombers and the training teams may have selected stations based on certain criteria like how crowded or how close to the center of the city they were. That would decrease the odds some. Yet also note that these calculations did not include the high odds against many other major terrorist events having trainings on exactly the same day that the event happened. **The one billion to one calculation is based on the London bombings alone. Add in the chances that each of many such events in different locations also had training exercises on exactly the same day and in the same city where terror events happened, training for the same scenario that happened, and the odds become astronomical.** Using just the date alone, the chances they would run an exercise on that exact date (assuming that they run that particular exercise once a year at most) are 365 to one. So when you consider them all together, the odds of all of these drills happening on the same date in the same place are trillions to one. And then add in that the chances that exercises they ran were almost the same as what happened during", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:2:616a79b4c784", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10132, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "become astronomical.** Using just the date alone, the chances they would run an exercise on that exact date (assuming that they run that particular exercise once a year at most) are 365 to one.

We don't know how many other terror events had similar training \"coincidences\" that weren't reported. For example, with the June 17, 2015 shootings at black churches in Charleston, South Carolina, a federal \"Active Shooter Threat Training Program\" was being held in Charleston on the day of the shooting, [as reported](https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/FY15%20Master%20Schedule%20Updated%2002-12-2015.pdf) on the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers website. But this was not reported in any media. Yet the above cases alone are plenty to raise serious questions. **What are the odds that simply \"by coincidence\" all of these trainings happened in the same place, on the same date, with virtually the same scenario that occurred?** It's practically impossible to have just been fate. So now come the hard questions of who, how, and why. **Digging deeper** Terrorist events and mass murders in recent times have instilled fear and rage in people around the world. Politicians have seized on these emotions to pass laws imposing greater surveillance and limiting civil liberties, as well as declaring war on the terrorists and denigrating groups like the Muslims and Syrians. **Yet what if, as [claimed by a highly decorated US general](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket), there are hidden forces actually manipulating all of these events in order to promote fear, stoke the fires of the war juggernaut, and pad the gilded pockets of the individuals and mega-corporations who profit from all this? ** If these events didn't happen just by coincidence, how did they happen? Who was behind them and how were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:4:f9aa3dce8dd0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10134, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "war on the terrorists and denigrating groups like the Muslims and Syrians. **Yet what if, as [claimed by a highly decorated US general](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket), there are hidden forces actually manipulating all of these events in order to promote fear, stoke the fires of the war juggernaut, and pad the gilded pockets of the individuals and mega-corporations who profit from all this? ** If these events didn't happen just by coincidence, how did they happen? Who was behind them and how were they involved? For those who have not studied such matters, there is a plausible explanation. Consider first Operation Northwoods, which has been revealed in declassified government documents. As [reported on ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662&page=1), \"America's top military leaders drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in US cities to trick the public into supporting a war against Cuba in the early 1960s. **Approved in writing by the Pentagon Joint Chiefs, Operation Northwoods even proposed blowing up a US ship and hijacking planes as a false pretext for war.\" ** A closer read of the [actual declassified documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods) shows the Pentagon's top generals looking for \"pretexts which could provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba.\" In order to keep their secret plans well hidden, that documents state, \"It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\" So the top generals of the Pentagon conspired to blow up a US ship and hijack planes and blame it all on Cuba in order to gain the public support necessary to start a war with Cuba. This is all well documented fact. **This type of operation is called [false flag terrorism](https://www.WantToKnow.info/falseflag), a term used to describe operations kept secret from the public in which a government or other entity purposely attacks itself in order to trick citizens into supporting their hidden agenda.** False flag operations are nothing new. They have been used for centuries to cause fear and panic in the public so that those behind them can push through a plan to which the public would otherwise never agree. Is it possible that some of the mass murders and terrorism mentioned above were false flag operations? If we ask who benefits, we see the results of these mass murders have most certainly benefited the politicians, military, and intelligence services clamoring for ever greater surveillance and ever more war. Without the fear generated by 9/11 and similar events, the public would never have submitted to such things at the Patriot Act and much more. So whoever is behind them, these terrorist events certainly benefit those who want more power and control over our lives. A question naturally arises. With so many involved, how is it possible to keep such a plan secret? You have to realize that those involved in these exercises and drills are not aware of the deeper", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:5:5a6e32841811", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10135, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the fear generated by 9/11 and similar events, the public would never have submitted to such things at the Patriot Act and much more.

With so many involved, how is it possible to keep such a plan secret? You have to realize that those involved in these exercises and drills are not aware of the deeper agenda. Even those who lead the drills are rarely in the know. Drill participants are part of a hierarchical command structure where those below carry out orders of those above them without question. **It is usually many levels above the drill leaders where the decision is made as to what drill will be carried out, when, and where. Secrets can be kept well when you have a strict compartmentalized structure such as those found in the military and intelligence services. False flag plans are hatched by rogue elements at very high levels in these agencies. ** Remember that Mr. Power, the manager of the London bombing exercises, had \"the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.\" He likely had no idea how by bizarre coincidence his drills perfectly matched the plot that unfolded. And remember how the top Pentagon generals restricted knowledge about Northwoods. It is likely that even lower level generals were not informed in order to keep the plans tightly compartmentalized and minimize the risk of a leak. **The only reason the Northwoods documents were declassified is that they were never carried out, as President Kennedy rejected the plan. If the plans had taken place and the U.S. had then attacked Cuba, you can bet the documents would still be sealed as top secret. ** **There is no doubt that there are many such documents which prove massive manipulation of public opinion through false flags which have never been declassified and are unlikely to see the light of day any time soon.** You can find an excellent survey of false flag terrorism in recent history on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/falseflag). So the above terrorist attacks may have been false flag operations, but who were the people involved? **Who are the terrorists?** What about the people who carried out these acts, you might ask. Did they know about the false flag aspect? ** Sometimes they are simply unaware citizens who were carefully selected as people the public will believe might do such a thing. Others secretly do the dirty deed and those blamed for it are then killed during or shortly after the event to cover it up. ** This may be what happened with the couple which has been accused in the San Bernardino killings. They clearly were Muslims and there is evidence (though some of it may have been faked) that they had extremist leanings. But if", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt:6:b90c8c9b6b5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10136, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__impossible-odds-mass-murders-terrorism", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "who were carefully selected as people the public will believe might do such a thing.

They clearly were Muslims and there is evidence (though some of it may have been faked) that they had extremist leanings. But if search, you will find that their friends, neighbors and colleagues were largely shocked and incredulous, though notice how the media sometimes leads them to agree that it must have been the couple who committed the crime. Consider also that one direct eyewitness [stated on CBS news](http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/witness-describes-the-san-bernardino-shooting/) that she saw \"three men dressed in all black military attire with vests on holding assault rifles.\" The host asks, \"You're certain that you saw three men?\" She answers, \"Yes. They were white. They looked like they had athletic builds, and they appeared to be tall.\" Another witness on an [NBC affiliate report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s45OeXNRZng) described \"three white men in military fatigues.\" [More on this here](http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/12/06/holes/). And the couple was killed shortly after the event. That is only one answer to the questions of who and how. A second answer involves the concept of Manchurian Candidates. **Declassified documents from the 1950s prove that the CIA developed [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/manchuriancandidate) in programs like [MKULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra). Through drugs, hypnosis, and torture, the CIA successfully fragmented subjects' personalities and created super spies who didn't even know they were spies. ** The core personality of a Manchurian Candidate is not aware that there are other alter personalities that surface when called out through code words. These alters can be trained to steal, plant bombs, murder, and sexually seduce targeted individuals, yet the core personality will have no memory what was done afterward.

The most egregious example is General Electric. Last year the conglomerate generated $10.3 billion in pretax income, but ended up owing nothing to Uncle Sam. In fact, it recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 billion. How did this happen? It's complicated. GE in effect consists of two divisions: General Electric Capital and everything else. The everything else--maker of engines, power plants, TV shows and the like--would have paid a 22% tax rate if it was a standalone company. It's GE Capital that keeps the overall tax bill so low. Over the last two years, **GE Capital has displayed an uncanny ability to lose lots of money in the U.S. (posting a $6.5 billion loss in 2009), and make lots of money overseas (a $4.3 billion gain). Not only do the U.S. losses balance out the overseas gains, but GE can defer taxes on that overseas income indefinitely.** It's the tax benefit of overseas operations that is the biggest reason why multinationals end up with lower tax rates than the rest of us. **Note:** Can you believe that GE not only pays no taxes, they actually get credit from the US government?

And in new signs of distress among the middle class, median household incomes fell last year to levels last seen in 1996**. Economists pointed to a telling statistic: It was the first time since the Great Depression that median household income, adjusted for inflation, had not risen over such a long period, said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. \"This is truly a lost decade,\" Mr. Katz said. The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade - including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession - had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. It is also fresh evidence that the disappointing economic recovery has done nothing for the country's poorest citizens. The report said the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line last year, 15.1 percent, was the highest level since 1993.

There's nothing unusual about that, except that Richards is homeless, too, and the 99-cent cheeseburger was an outsize chunk of the $9.50 he'd earned that day panhandling. The generosity of poor people isn't so much rare as rarely noticed, however. In fact, the nation's poor donate more, in percentage terms, than higher-income groups do. What's more, their generosity declines less in hard times than the generosity of richer givers does. ** The Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest survey of consumer expenditure found that the poorest fifth of U.S. households contributed an average of 4.3 percent of their incomes to charitable organizations in 2007. The richest fifth gave at less than half that rate, 2.1 percent.** The figures probably undercount remittances by legal and illegal immigrants to family and friends back home, a multibillion-dollar outlay to which the poor contribute disproportionally.

A 30-year gap now exists in the average life expectancy between Mississippi, in the Deep South, and Connecticut, in prosperous New England. Huge disparities have also opened up in income, health and education depending on where people live in the US. The American Human Development Index has [issued a report] measuring well-being ... with shocking results. **The US finds itself ranked 42nd in global life expectancy and 34th in survival of infants to age. Suicide and murder are among the top 15 causes of death and although the US is home to just 5 per cent of the global population it accounts for 24 per cent of the world's prisoners.** The report points to a rigged system that does little to lessen inequalities. \"The report shows that although America is one of the richest nations in the world, it is woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all Americans to build a better life,\" the authors said. Some of its more shocking findings reveal that ... Asian-American males have the best quality of life and black Americans the lowest, with a staggering 50-year life expectancy gap between the two groups. Using official government statistics, the study points out that because American schools are funded primarily from local property taxes, rich districts get the best state education. The US has no federally mandated sick pay, paternity leave or annual paid vacation. **Note:** For lots more on health issues from reliable, verifiable sources, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/healthnewsarticles). **What if growth had been equal?** **2010-09-13, *Washington Post*** [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/09/what_if_growth_had_been_e...](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/09/what_if_growth_had_been_equal.html) Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson [in their book [*Winner-Take-All Politics*](http://www.amazon.com/Winner-Take-All-Politics-Washington-Richer---Turned/dp/1416588698/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1284911132&sr=1-1) have] a table showing how incomes would look if growth had been equally shared from 1979 to 2006 -- much as it was in the decades before 1979.

America's top tier has grown infinitely richer and more removed over the past 25 years. Few among them send their children to public schools; fewer still send their loved ones to fight our wars. They own most of our stocks, making the stock market an unreliable indicator of the economic health of working people. **The top 1% now takes in an astounding 16% of national income, up from 8% in 1980. The tax codes protect them, just as they protect corporate America, through a vast system of loopholes.** Incestuous corporate boards regularly approve compensation packages for chief executives and others that are out of logic's range. As this newspaper has reported, the average CEO of a sizeable corporation makes more than $10 million a year, while the minimum wage for workers amounts to about $10,000 a year, and has not been raised in nearly a decade. **When I graduated from college in the 1960s, the average CEO made 20 times what the average worker made. Today, that CEO makes 400 times as much. Trickle-down economics didn't happen.** Wages and salaries are at all-time lows as a percentage of the national wealth. This ever-widening divide is too often ignored or downplayed by its beneficiaries. **Note:** For some reason the Wall Street Journal has removed this article.

The report also finds that those in financial services and the internet sectors predominate among the super rich. Europe, the US and some Asia Pacific nations account for most of the extremely wealthy. More than a third live in the US. Japan accounts for 27% of the total, the UK for 6% and France for 5%. The global study ... of the United Nations is the first to chart wealth distribution in every country as opposed to just income, for which more comprehensive date is available. It included all the most significant components of household wealth, including financial assets and debts, land, buildings and other tangible property. Together these total $125 trillion globally. **The report found the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total of global assets. Half the world's adult population, however, owned barely 1% of global wealth.** \"These levels of inequality are grotesque,\" said Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam. \"It is impossible to justify such vast wealth when 800 million people go to bed hungry every night.\" **Note:** For highly informative graphs showing the details of rising wealth inequality in the U.S., [click here](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-wealth-inequality-2010-7). **World's wealth gap grows; poorest half has 1% of assets** **2006-12-05, *Denver Post* (Denver's leading newspaper)** [http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_4785148](http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_4785148) The richest 2 percent of adults still own more than half of the world's household wealth, perpetuating a yawning global gap between rich and poor, according to research published Tuesday. The report from the Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economics Research shows that in 2000** the richest 1 percent of adults - most of whom live in Europe or the United States - owned 40 percent of global assets.

Even as millions of out-of-work and otherwise struggling Americans are tightening their belts for the holidays, the nation's elite are lacing up their dancing shoes and partying like royalty as the millions and billions keep rolling in. **Recessions are for the little people, not for the corporate chiefs and the titans of Wall Street who are at the heart of the American aristocracy. They have waged economic warfare against everybody else and are winning big time.** The ranks of the poor may be swelling and families forced out of their foreclosed homes may be enduring a nightmarish holiday season, but American companies have just experienced their most profitable quarter ever. The corporate fat cats are becoming alarmingly rotund. Their profits have surged over the past seven quarters at a pace that is among the fastest ever seen, and they can barely contain their glee. On the same day that *The Times* ran its [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/economy/24econ.html) about [record corporate] profits, it ran a piece on the front page that carried the headline: \"[With a Swagger, Wallets Out, Wall Street Dares to Celebrate](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24swagger.html).\" Anyone who thinks there is something beneficial in this vast disconnect between the fortunes of the American elite and those of the struggling masses is just silly.

Forbes.com: You got your own father, as well as other phenomenally wealthy people, to talk to you. How did you get these folks to open up about such an intensely private topic? Johnson: It wasn't easy. A lot of patience - there was a lot of waiting around. Forbes: I imagine you'll have critics who will call this \"rich boy's guilt.\" What do you say to them? Johnson: That both liberal and conservative economists agree that there is a growing wealth gap, and that it's a problem. It's important to get wealthy people to think about this and think about solving this problem. They are the most influential people in our society and therefore, they should be working on treating this and coming up with a solution. **Note:** The films of Jamie Johnson give very rare views into the lives of the upper crust that are incredibly revealing.

That is the highest figure recorded since the government began keeping track over 60 years ago.** The next-highest annual corporate profits level on record was in the third quarter of 2006, when they were $1.655 trillion. Corporate profits have been doing extremely well for a while. Since their cyclical low in the fourth quarter of 2008, profits have grown for seven consecutive quarters, at some of the fastest rates in history. As a share of gross domestic product, corporate profits also have been increasing, and they now represent 11.2 percent of total output. That is the highest share since the fourth quarter of 2006, when they accounted for 11.7 percent of output. **Note:** Long-term unemployment is at a [record high](http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/21/news/economy/long_term_unemployment/index.htm), yet corporations are raking in record profits.

I try to find the most widely respected sources for any [articles I summarize](https://www.wanttoknow.info/newsarticles) for this website. Most people tend to respect messages which are backed up by information posted on websites of the major media, universities, or government sources. Below are a few key Internet research techniques to use search engines more effectively and find the most reliable sources. The tips covered are: How to verify and find the strongest source for information Set your search results to 100 Take advantage of the \"Cache\" link Find disappeared articles and older versions of webpages when you have the URL Use search engines to search a single website How to find reliable sources when you only have text or video Search for reliable videos Consider a \"What You Can Do\" section **Note:** For a separate article with great tips on how to improve the ranking of your website or webpages on search engines, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/search_engine_rank_improve). **How to Verify and Find the Strongest Source for Information ** Whenever you receive important information about which you are uncertain, there are several ways you can try to verify what you've received. Particularly if you are writing an email to friends or posting a message to the Internet with information that may be difficult to believe, your friends and readers will generally trust what you write more if you include links to reliable sources for any key information you provide. Here are a few key techniques you can use to verify information and find the best sources: Pick out several of the key words which would identify Internet posts on the topic. Type them into a search engine. On the results list, scan the URLs at the bottom of each entry. Look for the most reliable source listed. Search Google and other search engines like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), as they often differ. At the bottom of the search page, if you find \"repeat the search with the omitted results included,\" it may be worthwhile to click it to find more results. If you don't immediately find a good source, search both on the search engine's regular search page and its news search page. The regular search is more complete, but often has many entries from non-reliable sources. The news search page limits your search to more reliable news websites, but often misses key important sources. If the information you are searching is recent news, you might want to start on the news search pages. Using the tools menu on these search engines, you can also select for certain dates or arrange by most recent articles first, which can be very helpful. **Set Your Search Results to 100** To ease your searches, set your search engine to display 100", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__internet_search_techniques.txt:0:de85d32324df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10152, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__internet_search_techniques.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__internet_search_techniques", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "news search page limits your search to more reliable news websites, but often misses key important sources. If the information you are searching is recent news, you might want to start on the news search pages. Using the tools menu on these search engines, you can also select for certain dates or arrange by most recent articles first, which can be very helpful. **Set Your Search Results to 100** To ease your searches, set your search engine to display 100 results. Here are directions to do so using Google. Yahoo is similar, though the page you want is under the link \"Options\" and then \"Settings.\". Go the \"Search settings\" link. It is in the drop down menu on the wheel icon at the top right of the Google search page. Scroll down to \"Number of Results\" and change it to 100. This makes searching through more than 10 results much easier. In that same window you might want to choose \"Open search results in a new browser window.\" Click \"Save Preferences\" and you are done. ** Take Advantage of the \"Cache\" Link** If you click on a search entry and it gives you a blank page or an error message, it will usually still be available at that cache link. To find the \"Cache\" button on Google, click on the green downward pointing arrow at the end of the second line and select \"Cached\". On Yahoo, click on \"Cached\" at the end of the second line. If these are no longer there (the search engines have fequently changed how to access the cache), do a search to find out how to access the cache. You might want to download and save the entire cached page (File > Save Page As), as it will likely disappear from the search engine before too long if the webpage has been removed. **Find Disappeared Articles and Older Versions of Webpages When You Have the URL** The Internet Archive is a very useful source for Internet research. It can be used to find a copy of an important web page that has been removed. It can also be used if a webpage has been changed and you want to see what it used to look like. Here's how to use this great resource. Copy the URL (Internet address) of the missing or changed page. Go to [http://www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org/). If there is anything in the \"Wayback Machine\" box, delete it. Paste the URL you've copied into the box and click the \"Take Me Back\" button. Click on any date listed to see the original article as it was posted on that date. The above method will show you exactly how the webpage looked on the date it was copied into the archive. Please note, however, that any website can request not to be listed on the Internet archive. Though very few websites have done this, unfortunately many", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__internet_search_techniques.txt:1:23249792c240", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10153, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__internet_search_techniques.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__internet_search_techniques", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "box, delete it. Paste the URL you've copied into the box and click the \"Take Me Back\" button. Click on any date listed to see the original article as it was posted on that date. The above method will show you exactly how the webpage looked on the date it was copied into the archive. Please note, however, that any website can request not to be listed on the Internet archive. Though very few websites have done this, unfortunately many major media websites have done so. If this is the case, you may still be able to find the article on another website using a quote from the original article, as mentioned in the section immediately below. **How to Find Reliable Sources When You Only Have Text or Video** If you receive the text of an article you want to use that claims to be from a major news, government, or other reliable source, but no link is given, or the link is to an less-known news website, you can usually find the original article easily on its source website. The same technique can be used when you watch a Google, YouTube, or other video of a news report and want to find the report posted on the major media website. Copy a string of seven to ten words or so from the text. It is generally better to find text with less commonly used words. Copy that string of words into your favorite search engine and put quotation marks on both ends. This limits the search to only webpages with that exact string and order of words. Click \"Search\" Scan the URLs at the bottom of each entry listed to find the news website. If the list is too long and the article is less than a month old, click on the \"News\" link. This limits the search to pages from websites defined as news websites by these search engines. For video, use the same technique by typing in a string of seven or so words spoken in the video. For articles from a news agency like AP (Associated Press), some people will be more convinced if the article is picked up by a website like MSNBC, ABC, New York Times, etc. By doing a search on a string of words as instructed above, you will often find the article published on a major media website. You can then list the sources as something like MSNBC/AP or New York Times/AFP. **Always include links for verification. ** **Important Note:** If a legitimate, but important AP article is not picked up by other media sites, you can then be fairly certain it is being censored by media ownership. In my extensive research on the Internet, I have found this happens often with subjects most sensitive to the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world.

In the search engine, simply type \"site:\" then enter the site's URL, no quotation marks. Type in a space after the URL, and then whatever words or string of words you want to search. When entering the site, http:// and www are not necessary, but there must be no space between the colon after the word \"site\" and the URL. **Example:** [site:nytimes.com project mkultra](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=f2b&num=100&newwindow=1&q=site%3Anytimes.com+project+mkultra&btnG=Search) **Search for Reliable Videos** You can sometimes find video coverage of key information by doing a simple video search using key words at [www.google.com/videohp](http://www.google.com/videohp). Google owns both Google Video and YouTube. They also list many other video websites on the video search page, so searching this one resource gives you search results for most popular video websites online. A few times I've been amazed to find video footage of sensitive articles which disappeared from their source website. Even if you have the written text from a major media website, including a link to or embedding a video report of the text in your message can make it much stronger. **Consider a \"What You Can Do\" Section** These Internet search tips should help you to find the most solid sources available for information you receive and articles you write.

In 2021, we received a major cryptocurrency donation which enabled us last year to hire a wonderful, highly talented young woman Amber Yang. After working with us for over six months now, Amber is up to speed on most of our work and has already taken over a significant part of my work load. I am now working only half time on PEERS as Amber steps up to gradually take the reins of this great organization. Amber is beautifully aligned with the PEERS mission of cultivating community and transformation through inspiration and education. She has lots of creative ideas, a few of which she shares in her first message to you below. Please warmly welcome Amber and support her in our great work to educate the public to the deeper forces of all that is going on in our world and in inspiring us all to come together to make a difference and shine our light brightly in these dark and challenging times. With very best wishes for a transformed world, Fred Burks PEERS Executive Director Hello PEERS readers! This message serves as a preview of some of what's to come, including the introduction of who I am as a new team member for PEERS. My name is Amber Yang, and I feel humbled to be working for an organization dedicated to personal and social transformation. I'll be assuming many of the leadership duties that keep our efforts afloat, while Fred gradually transitions to the sidelines as a guide and adviser for me and our other important team members. I'll also play an active part in redesigning certain aspects of WantToKnow.info, while also curating new and relevant content. Some of this involves developing online centers for constructive societal solutions, media literacy skills, and a video vlog series! As a millennial awakening to the magnitude of corruption and the polycrisis facing society, I am curious about how I can use my time and energy wisely while I'm here on this planet. I feel called to be an increasingly effective translator in the face of groupthink, divisive politics, and complex social realities. Going further, I am passionate about being a convener of positive, creative change. For the past 8 years, I've been climbing the ladder of insight, personal growth, and activism on many different fronts.

It was here that I co-created [a new model for journalism and media](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Rebvj12aLGEzQ2AWhzZk7-Ul6WBjpDT/view?usp=sharing), that reinvents outdated narratives, engages people across political and cultural lines, and emphasizes collective power and the common good. **Something I'm coming to in my journey is that we can't make sense of our times alone, nor within our own echo chambers. **I've worked with a lot of different personalities, across diverse efforts and spaces. The challenges and opportunities of human collaboration is what led me to attain my Master's degree in Organizational Development and Change at Sonoma State University in Northern California in 2020. My activism isn't just based on the facts and data stored in my head about how the world works. The future I believe worth aspiring for fosters social-emotional intelligence in how we relate to ourselves, each other, and the world. An activism that invites us to undergo personal transformation, knowing ourselves outside the distress of oppression and fear to create the world we want to live in. An activism that mobilizes systems thinking to support shifts in human consciousness, increasing our ability and capacity to construct new, creative connections beyond polarized, linear thinking. As a digital artist and freestyle dancer, my activism also focuses on the power of what art can bring to social movements.

But one potential consequence looms especially large: They may also be prosecuted**. This month, a retired police lieutenant in Memphis, Tenn., Cody Wilkerson, testified, as part of a lawsuit against the city, not only that police detectives sometimes neglected to investigate cases of sexual assault but also that he overheard the head of investigative services in the city's police department say, [on his first day in charge](http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2017/11/08/r-memphis-cop-testifies-city-neglected-rape-cases/844176001/): \"The first thing we need to do is start locking up more victims for false reporting.\" It's an alarming choice of priorities. In 2015 we [wrote an article](https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story) ... about Marie, an 18-year-old who reported being raped. Instead of interviewing her as a victim, [detectives] interrogated her as a suspect. Under pressure, Marie eventually recanted - and was charged with false reporting, punishable by up to a year in jail. More than two years later, the police in Colorado arrested a serial rapist - and discovered a photograph proving he had raped Marie. Cases like hers can be found around the country. In 1997, a legally blind woman [reported being raped](https://archive.org/details/JohnL.QuinlanCryRape_OneWoman_sHarrowingQuestforJustice_byBillLueders) at knife point in Madison, Wis. That same year, a pregnant 16-year-old [reported being raped](http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/victim-vindication-admits-raping-qns-girl-article-1.556154) in New York City.

More than 2,000 of the 3,281 individuals tracked down on these sentences by the ACLU are being held in the federal system.

They are unanimous on one key point: James Earl Ray did not kill Martin Luther King. For the King family and others in the civil rights movement, the FBI's obsession with King in the years leading up to his slaying in Memphis on April 4, 1968 - pervasive surveillance, a malicious disinformation campaign and open denunciations by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover - laid the groundwork for their belief that he was the target of a plot. Until her own death in 2006, Coretta Scott King, who endured the FBI's campaign to discredit her husband, was open in her belief that a conspiracy led to the assassination. Her family [filed a civil suit](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/martin_luther_king_jr_mlk_assassination_video) in 1999 ... and **a [Memphis jury ruled](https://www.wanttoknow.info/assassinations/king-martin-luther/king-family-trial-transcript-full.pdf) that the local, state and federal governments were liable for King's death.** **\"There is abundant evidence,\" Coretta King said after the verdict, \"of a major, high-level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband.\" The jury found the mafia and various government agencies \"were deeply", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt:2:3e08901d3d5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10161, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "King, who endured the FBI's campaign to discredit her husband, was open in her belief that a conspiracy led to the assassination.

Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.\"** But nothing changed afterward. William Pepper, a New York lawyer and civil rights activist who knew and worked with King ... became convinced of Ray's innocence and continued to investigate the case even after Ray died.

In 2007, despite ample [evidence], federal prosecutors and Epstein's lawyers quietly put together a remarkable deal for Epstein. He and his accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges. After the FBI case was closed in 2008, witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that there were [hundreds of girls](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html) who were brought to Epstein's homes, including girls from Europe, Latin America and former Soviet Republic countries.

In their first media interviews about the case, **Reiter and Recarey revealed [how they were] pressured by then-Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer to downgrade the case to a misdemeanor or drop it altogether**.

[The study](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Government_Misconduct_and_Convicting_the_Innocent.pdf) by the National Registry of Exonerations reviewed 2,400 exonerations it has logged between 1989 and 2019, nearly 80 percent of which were for violent felonies. **Of the 2,400, 93 innocent defendants were sentenced to death and later cleared before they were executed. The study also found that police and prosecutors are rarely disciplined for actions that lead to a wrongful conviction**. Researchers found that 4 percent of prosecutors involved in those convictions were disciplined, but the penalties were \"comparatively mild\" and only three were disbarred. Police officers were disciplined in 19 percent of cases leading to wrongful convictions, and in 80 percent of those cases officers were convicted of crimes, such as Chicago police Sgt. Ronald Watts, who led a group of officers who planted drug or gun evidence leading to 66 false convictions. The 2,400 cases are far from a comprehensive count, since there is no centralized national database of criminal cases at the state and local levels. So an estimate of how often wrongful convictions occur, as a percentage of overall cases, is not possible. The study acknowledges there are other areas to examine, including quantifying ineffective assistance by defense attorneys. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on corruption in policing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/police-corruptionnewsarticles) and in the [judicial system](https://www.wanttoknow.info/court-judicial-corruptionnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **He got life for stealing hedge clippers.

The basic story is this: Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier. He is also a sexual pervert who, until about 12 years ago, preyed serially on teenage children, roughly until they reached the age of consent and became, in his eyes, unattractive. What did authorities do when they found out, back in 2005? They spent a couple of years investigating and drawing up an indictment, then proceeded to quash further investigation, cooperated with Epstein's lawyers to avoid publicity, violated procedures about plea bargains, made Epstein serve only 13 months in confinement, put him in the county jail rather than state prison ... and concealed most of the terms of the settlement from the public and the victims themselves.

No criminal charges were filed, and no executives or employees were prosecuted. Instead, HSBC pledged to clean up its institutional culture, and to pay a fine of nearly two billion dollars: the equivalent of four weeks' profit for the bank. In the years since the mortgage crisis of 2008 ... corporate executives have essentially been granted immunity.

It imprisons people for longer periods of time, more mercilessly, and for more trivial transgressions than any nation in the west. This sprawling penal state has been constructed over decades, by both political parties, and it punishes the poor and racial minorities at overwhelmingly disproportionate rates. **But not everyone is subjected to that system of penal harshness. It all changes radically when the nation's most powerful actors are caught breaking the law.

By a 6-2 vote, the court upheld a federal law that offers compensation to these victims but closes the courthouse door to lawsuits. **Justice Antonin Scalia said the high court majority agreed with Congress that these side effects were \"unavoidable\" when a vaccine is given to millions of children. If the drug makers could be sued and forced to pay huge claims for devastating injuries, the vaccine industry could be wiped out, he said.** The American Academy of Pediatrics applauded the decision. The ruling was a defeat for the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, who as a child was given a standard vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. She later suffered a series of seizures and delayed development. Her parents sought compensation for her injuries, but their claim was turned down. They then sued the drug maker in a Pennsylvania court, contending that the vaccine was defectively designed.

The 5-to-4 ... majority's thinking is based on absolutist vision of free speech and belief that corporations and unions have the same constitutional protections as individuals when it comes to basic rights. **This viewpoint is \"a rejection of the common sense of the American people,\" said Justice John Paul Stevens, who read his angry dissent out loud. Corporations \"are not themselves members of 'We the People,' by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.\"** It's hard to overstate the legal sweep of the decision.

The five-member majority didn't just blaze new ground; it torched the court's own past record. In practical terms, the decision amounts to a political earthquake. Big-money issues such as health care, cap-and-trade pollution controls and Wall Street regulations will drive attack ads against politicians who refuse to do the bidding of particular special interests. **Note:** For more deep insights into the flaws in the US electoral system, [click here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/electionsnewsarticles).

The ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, came in the case of Jose Padilla, a former gang member and U.S. citizen arrested in Chicago in 2002 and a month later designated an \"enemy combatant\" by President Bush. Padilla has been held without trial in a U.S. naval brig for more than three years, and his case has ignited a fierce battle over the balance between civil liberties and the government's power to fight terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. A host of civil liberties groups and former attorney general Janet Reno weighed in on Padilla's behalf, calling his detention illegal and arguing that the president does not have unchecked power to lock up U.S. citizens indefinitely. In its ruling yesterday, the three-judge panel overturned a lower court. Avidan Cover, a senior associate at [Human Rights First](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/), said** the ruling \"really flies in the face of our understanding of what rights American citizens are entitled to.\" Opponents have warned that if not constrained by the courts, Padilla's detention could lead to the military being allowed to hold anyone who, for example, checks out what the government considers the wrong kind of reading materials from the library. ** **Note:** For many disturbing reports from major media sources on government threats to civil liberties, [click here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/civillibertiesnewsarticles). **Court OKs Barring High IQs for Cops** **2000-09-08, ABC News** [http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.UMuV...](https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.UMuVUawkSSo) A man whose bid to become a police officer was rejected after he scored too high on an intelligence test has lost an appeal in his federal lawsuit against the city.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt:11:de77e9f7cd5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10170, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "hold anyone who, for example, checks out what the government considers the wrong kind of reading materials from the library. ** **Note:** For many disturbing reports from major media sources on government threats to civil liberties, [click here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/civillibertiesnewsarticles). **Court OKs Barring High IQs for Cops** **2000-09-08, ABC News** [http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.UMuV...](https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.UMuVUawkSSo) A man whose bid to become a police officer was rejected after he scored too high on an intelligence test has lost an appeal in his federal lawsuit against the city. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court's decision that the city did not discriminate against Robert Jordan because the same standards were applied to everyone who took the test. **\"This kind of puts an official face on discrimination in America against people of a certain class,\" Jordan said today from his Waterford home. \"I maintain you have no more control over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your gender or anything else.\"** Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate, took the exam in 1996 and scored 33 points, the equivalent of an IQ of 125. But New London police interviewed only candidates who scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those who scored too high could get bored with police work and leave soon after undergoing costly training. The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22, the equivalent of an IQ of 104, or just a little above average. Jordan alleged his rejection from the police force was discrimination. He sued the city, saying his civil rights were violated because he was denied equal protection under the law. But the U.S. District Court found that New London had \"shown a rational basis for the policy.\" In a ruling dated Aug. 23, the 2nd Circuit agreed. The court said the policy might be unwise but was a rational way to reduce job turnover. Jordan has worked as a prison guard since he took the test. **City's Annual Cost Per Inmate Is $168,000, Study Finds** **2013-08-23, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/nyregion/citys-annual-cost-per-inmate-is-ne...](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/nyregion/citys-annual-cost-per-inmate-is-nearly-168000-study-says.html) **New York City is an expensive place to live for just about everyone, including prisoners.

The cost of incarcerating people in New York City's jails is nearly three times as much. 83 percent of the expense per prisoner came from wages, benefits for staff and pension costs. **Some 76 percent of the inmates in the city were waiting for their cases to be disposed**.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to reinstate a suit against Fresno police by two people whose homes and business were searched in 2013 during a gambling investigation. After the search, three officers signed an inventory sheet saying they had seized about $50,000. But the two owners, Micah Jessop and Brittan Ashjian, who operated automatic teller machines ... said the officers had actually taken $276,000 - $151,000 in cash and $125,000 in rare coins - and pocketed the difference. Darrell York, Jessop's and Ashjian's attorney, said police and a city attorney denied that a theft occurred. Even if Kumagai and his fellow officers stole money and coins from Jessop and Ashjian, the appeals court said, the owners could not sue in federal court to get their money back. Such a suit would require proof that their constitutional rights were violated, the court said, and suits against police must clear the additional hurdle of showing that those rights were \"clearly established.\" \"The allegation of any theft by police officers - most certainly the theft of over $225,000 - is undoubtedly deeply", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt:13:735214c30b74", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__judicial-corruption-news-articles", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "his fellow officers stole money and coins from Jessop and Ashjian, the appeals court said, the owners could not sue in federal court to get their money back.

Iran, for example, has been criticized for denying fair public trials and limiting privacy, while Russia has been taken to task for undermining due process. Other countries have been condemned for the use of secret evidence and torture. Even as we pass judgment on countries we consider unfree, Americans remain confident that any definition of a free nation must include their own - the land of free. Yet, the laws and practices of the land should shake that confidence. **In the decade since Sept. 11, 2001, this country has comprehensively reduced civil liberties in the name of an expanded security state.** The most recent example of this was [the National Defense Authorization Act](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-signs-defense-bill-pledges-to-maintain-legal-rights-of-terror-suspects/2011/12/31/gIQATzbkSP_story.html), signed Dec. 31, which allows for the indefinite detention of citizens.

Yet, objectively, we may be only half right. Those countries do lack basic individual rights such as due process, placing them outside any reasonable definition of \"free,\" but the United States now has much more in common with such regimes than anyone may like to admit. These countries also have constitutions that purport to guarantee freedoms and rights. But their governments have broad discretion in denying those rights and few real avenues for challenges by citizens - precisely the problem with the new laws in this country. The list of powers acquired by the U.S. government since 9/11 puts us in rather troubling company. **1. Assassination of U.S. citizens ** President Obama has claimed, as President George W. Bush did before him, the [right to order](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/26/AR2010012604239_2.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2010012700394) the killing of any citizen considered a terrorist or an abettor of terrorism. Last year, he approved the killing of [U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaqi](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/aulaqi-killing-reignites-debate-on-limits-of-executive-power/2011/09/30/gIQAx1bUAL_story.html) and another citizen under this claimed inherent authority. Last month, administration officials affirmed that power, stating that the [president can order the assassination](http://news.yahoo.com/obama-lawyers-citizens-targeted-war-us-154313473.html) of any citizen whom he considers allied with terrorists. (Nations such as Nigeria, Iran and Syria have been routinely criticized for extrajudicial killings of enemies of the state.) **2. Indefinite detention ** Under the law signed last month, terrorism suspects are to be held by the military; the president also has the authority to indefinitely detain citizens accused of terrorism. While the administration claims that this provision only codified existing law, experts widely contest this view, and the administration has opposed efforts to challenge such authority in federal courts. The government continues to claim the right to strip citizens of legal protections based on its sole discretion. (China recently codified a more limited detention law for its citizens, while countries such as Cambodia have been singled out by the United States for \"prolonged detention.\") **3. Arbitrary justice** The president now decides whether a person will receive a trial in the federal courts or in a military tribunal, a system that has been ridiculed around the world for lacking basic due process protections. Bush claimed this authority in 2001, and Obama has continued the practice. (Egypt and China have been denounced for maintaining separate military justice systems for selected defendants, including civilians.) **4. Warrantless searches** The president may now order warrantless surveillance, including a new capability to force companies and organizations to turn over information on citizens' finances, communications and associations. Bush acquired this sweeping power under the Patriot Act", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt:1:c314fa539373", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10175, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "that has been ridiculed around the world for lacking basic due process protections.

Bush acquired this sweeping power under the Patriot Act in 2001, and in 2011, Obama [extended the power,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patriot-act-extension-signed-into-law-despite-bipartisan-resistance-in-congress/2011/05/27/AGbVlsCH_story.html) including searches of everything from business documents to library records. The government can use [\"national security letters\"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/13/AR2008031302277.html) to demand, without probable cause, that organizations turn over information on citizens - and order them not to reveal the disclosure to the affected party. (Saudi Arabia and Pakistan operate under laws that allow the government to engage in widespread discretionary surveillance.) **5. Secret evidence** The government now routinely uses secret evidence to detain individuals and employs secret evidence in federal and military courts. It also forces the dismissal of cases against the United States by simply filing declarations that the cases would make the government reveal classified information that would harm national security - a claim made in a variety of privacy lawsuits and largely accepted by federal judges without question. Even legal opinions, cited as the basis for the government's actions under the Bush and Obama administrations, have been classified. **This allows the government to claim secret legal arguments to support secret proceedings using secret evidence. **In addition, some cases never make it to court at all. The federal courts routinely deny constitutional challenges to policies and programs under a narrow definition of standing to bring a case. **6. War crimes** The world clamored for prosecutions of those responsible for waterboarding terrorism suspects during the Bush administration, [but the Obama administration said in 2009](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041602768.html?hpid=topnews) that it would not allow CIA employees to be investigated or prosecuted for such actions. **This gutted not just treaty obligations but the Nuremberg principles of international law. **When courts in countries such as Spain moved to investigate Bush officials for war crimes, the Obama administration reportedly urged foreign officials not to allow such cases to proceed, despite the fact that the United States has long claimed the same authority with regard to alleged war criminals in other countries. (Various nations have resisted investigations of officials accused of war crimes and torture. Some, such as Serbia and Chile, eventually relented to comply with international law; countries that have denied independent investigations include Iran, Syria and China.) **7. Secret court** The government has increased its use of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has expanded its secret warrants to include individuals deemed to be aiding or abetting hostile foreign governments or organizations. In 2011, Obama renewed these powers, including allowing secret searches of individuals who are not part", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt:2:71acc18eca61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10176, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "war crimes and torture.

In 2011, Obama renewed these powers, including allowing secret searches of individuals who are not part of an identifiable terrorist group. The administration has asserted the right to ignore congressional limits on such surveillance. (Pakistan places national security surveillance under the unchecked powers of the military or intelligence services.) **8. Immunity from judicial review** Like the Bush administration, the Obama administration has successfully pushed for immunity for companies that assist in warrantless surveillance of citizens, blocking the ability of citizens to challenge the violation of privacy. (Similarly, China has maintained sweeping immunity claims both inside and outside the country and routinely blocks lawsuits against private companies.) **9. Continual monitoring of citizens** The Obama administration has successfully defended its claim that [it can use GPS devices](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/supreme-courts-gps-case-asks-how-much-privacy-do-we-expect/2011/11/10/gIQAN0RzCN_story.html)to monitor every move of targeted citizens without securing any court order or review. (Saudi Arabia has installed massive public surveillance systems, while Cuba is notorious for active monitoring of selected citizens.) **10. Extraordinary renditions** The government now has the ability to transfer both citizens and noncitizens to another country under a system known as extraordinary rendition, which has been denounced as using other countries, such as Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan, to torture suspects. The Obama administration says it is not continuing the abuses of this practice under Bush, but it insists on the unfettered right to order such transfers - including the possible transfer of U.S. citizens. **Final Comments: Land of the Free?** These new laws have come with an infusion of money into [an expanded security system](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/)on the state and federal levels, including more public surveillance cameras, tens of thousands of security personnel and a massive expansion of a terrorist-chasing bureaucracy. Some politicians shrug and say these increased powers are merely a response to the times we live in. Thus, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) could declare [in an interview last spring](http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/FTN_040311.pdf?tag=contentMain;contentBody)without objection that \"free speech is a great idea, but we're in a war.\" Of course, terrorism will never \"surrender\" and end this particular \"war.\" Other politicians rationalize that, while such powers may exist, it really comes down to how they are used. This is a common response by liberals who cannot bring themselves to denounce Obama as they did Bush. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), for instance, has insisted that[Congress is not making any decision](http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech/levin-floor-statement-on-detainee-provisions-of-ndaa) on indefinite detention: \"That is a decision which we leave where it belongs - in the executive branch.\" And in a signing statement with the defense authorization bill, Obama said he does not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt:3:a326a3d90122", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10177, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__land_of_the_free_erosion_of_freedom", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "that, while such powers may exist, it really comes down to how they are used.

Yet, he still accepted the power as a sort of regretful autocrat. **An authoritarian nation is defined not just by the use of authoritarian powers, but by the ability to use them. If a president can take away your freedom or your life on his own authority, all rights become little more than a discretionary grant subject to executive will.** ** The framers lived under autocratic rule and understood this danger better than we do. James Madison famously warned that we needed a system that did not depend on the good intentions or motivations of our rulers: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary.\"** Benjamin Franklin was more direct. In 1787, a Mrs. Powel confronted Franklin after the signing of the Constitution and asked, \"Well, Doctor, what have we got - a republic or a monarchy?\" His response was a bit chilling: \"A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.\" Since 9/11, we have created the very government the framers feared: a government with sweeping and largely unchecked powers resting on the hope that they will be used wisely. The indefinite-detention provision in the defense authorization bill seemed to many civil libertarians like a betrayal by Obama. **While the president had [promised to veto the law](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2011/12/obama-pulls-veto-threat-on-defense-bill-107514.html) over that provision, Levin, a sponsor of the bill, [disclosed on the Senate floor](http://www.c-spanvideo.org/appearance/600839442) that it was in fact the White House that approved the removal of any exception for citizens from indefinite detention.** Dishonesty from politicians is nothing new for Americans. The real question is whether we are lying to ourselves when we call this country the land of the free. ** Jonathan Turley** is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University. **Note:** You can find the original article on the Washington Post website at [this link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-the-united-states-still-the-land-of-the-free/2012/01/04/gIQAvcD1wP_story.html). **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information on the erosion of freedom.

People are divided into conservative and liberal camps to duke it out and see who comes out on top. And this has only intensified since the coronavirus hit. When the Republicans come out on top and control political power in the U.S., all our problems are blamed on their conservative agenda. When the Democrats take control, our problems are blamed on their leftist policies. Yet somehow the uber-rich global elite are rarely blamed, and they always manage to come out richer. It's called \"divide and conquer\" and is a tactic that has been used by the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world for centuries. What would happen if instead of polarizing left and right, we chose to focus more on the split between top and bottom? What if we prioritized pointing out the huge gap and inequalities between the power elite and the rest of us?

To this end, the master of deception crafts ingenious illusions to divert attention from reality. As the audience is held entranced, the deceptive acts are committed. For the gullible, reality then becomes inexplicably built upon on a lie. That is, until the those fooled wake up, realize that they have been duped, and recognize the truth. Maintaining belief in the illusion, however, is often more comforting than exposing the magician's secrets. We live in a world of illusion carefully crafted by unseen magicians. So many of the concerns that occupy the mind and the tasks that fill the calendar arise from unconsciously implanted impulses to become someone or something that we are not. This is no accident. **As we are indoctrinated into the corporate-consumer culture that now dominates the human race, we are entrained from a very early age into a [collective mentality](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/transcending_tribal_mentality) that espouses untouchable truths and promotes particular ways of being and behaving as required to succeed in our world.** Remorseless [psychopaths](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/01/22/psychopath-vs-empath-war-truth-deception/) within the power elite in our world act as the cunning magicians who subtly manipulate us with countless unseen deceptions. They blind us with endless barrages of innuendos and absolutes aimed at shattering self-confidence. And the vast majority on our planet are too overwhelmed or too complacent to peer behind the magician's veil and explore the deeper truths awaiting those with the courage to go there.

And all the while, they are laughing at you.\" - ***[Banksy](http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/brilliant-comic-of-banksys-call-to-arms-against-the-advertisers/)** Yet advertising is just the tip of the iceberg. When we look further, we see the overall organization of life in our modern world is centered around the pursuit of illusions and automatic obedience to institutions and ideas which are not at all what they seem. Most of us are in a very real sense enslaved by this system. Many call this somewhat intangible feeling of oppression \"the matrix,\" a system of [pervasive control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/totalcontrol) that invades the mind, programming individuals to pattern themselves in accordance with a mainstream [conformist](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/05/28/nonconformity-normalcy-bias/) version of reality, no matter how wicked it gets. Six of the grandest of the illusions which keep us enslaved to the matrix, the ones that have so many of us still entranced, are outlined below for your consideration. 1. THE ILLUSION OF LAW, ORDER AND AUTHORITY For so many of us, following the law is considered a moral obligation, and many of us gladly do so even though corruption, scandal, and wickedness repeatedly demonstrate that the law is plenty flexible for those who have the muscle to bend it. Police brutality and police criminality is rampant in the US, the courts favor the wealthy, and we can no longer even lead our lives privately thanks to the intrusion of state surveillance. And all the while the illegal and immoral [permanent war](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption) rages on in the background of life, murdering and destroying whole nations and cultures. The social order is not what it seems, for it is entirely predicated on conformity, obedience and acquiescence which are enforced by fear of chaos and violence. **History teaches us again and again that the law is far too often used as an instrument of oppression, social control and plunder, and too much so-called authority in this regard is false, hypocritical, and unjust.** In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\" When the law itself does not follow the law, there is no law, there is no order, and there is no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths.txt:1:7ba949bf22ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10184, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "this regard is false, hypocritical, and unjust.** In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\" When the law itself does not follow the law, there is no law, there is no order, and there is no justice. The pomp and trappings of authority are merely a concealment of the truth that the current world order is predicated on control, not consent. 2. THE ILLUSION OF PROSPERITY AND HAPPINESS Adorning oneself in expensive clothes and trinkets, and amassing collections of material possessions that would be the envy of any 18th century monarch has become a substitute for genuine prosperity. Maintaining the illusion of prosperity, though, is critical to our economy because its foundation is built on consumption, [fraud, credit and debt](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/01/13/debt-fraud-secrets-banking-system/). The banking system itself [has been engineered](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup) from the top down to create unlimited wealth for some while taxing the eternity out of the rest of us. **True prosperity manifests as a vibrant environment with an abundance of health, happiness, love, and relationships.** As more people come to perceive material goods as the form of self-identification in this culture, we slip farther and farther away from the experience of true prosperity. 3. THE ILLUSION OF CHOICE AND FREEDOM Read between the lines and look at the fine print. We are not free, not by any intelligent standard. Freedom is about having choice, yet in today's world, choice has come to mean a selection between meager options, always from within the confines of a corrupt legal and taxation system and within the boundaries of culturally accepted and enforced norms. Look no further than the dubious institution of modern democracy in the US to find a shining example of false choices appearing real. **Two entrenched, corrupt political parties are paraded as the pride and hope of the nation, yet third party and independent voices are intentionally blocked, ridiculed and plowed under.** The illusion of choice and freedom is a powerful oppressor because it fools us into accepting chains and short leashes as though they were the hallmarks of liberty. 4. THE ILLUSION OF TRUTH Truth has become a touchy subject in our culture. We've been programmed to believe that \"the truth\" comes from the demigods of media, celebrity, and government. If the media declares something to be true, then we are heretics and publicly ridiculed if we believe otherwise. **In order to maintain order, the powers that be depend on our acquiescence to their version of the truth**. Even as independent thinkers and journalists continually blow holes in the official versions of reality, the illusion of truth is so powerful that it takes a serious personal upheaval to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths.txt:2:3fb3dd0e87b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10185, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__magicians-veil-hides-life-truths", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "that \"the truth\" comes from the demigods of media, celebrity, and government. If the media declares something to be true, then we are heretics and publicly ridiculed if we believe otherwise. **In order to maintain order, the powers that be depend on our acquiescence to their version of the truth**. Even as independent thinkers and journalists continually blow holes in the official versions of reality, the illusion of truth is so powerful that it takes a serious personal upheaval to shun the cognitive dissonance needed to function in a society that openly chases false realities. 5. THE ILLUSION OF TIME They say that time is money, but this is a lie. Time is your life. Your life continually unfolds in an ever-evolving manifestation of the now. Looking beyond the five-sense world, where we have been trained to move in accordance with the clock and the calendar, we find that the human spirit is eternal, and that the each individual soul is part of this eternity. **The magician's deception here is the subtle reinforcement of the idea that the present moment is of little to no value, that the past is something we cannot undo or ever forget, and that the future is intrinsically more important than the present.** This carries our attention away from what is actually happening right now and directs it toward a fearful future. Once completely focused on what is to come rather than what is, we are easy prey to advertisers and fear-pimps who muddy our vision of the future with every possible worry and concern imaginable. We are happiest when life doesn't box us in, when spontaneity and randomness gives us the chance to find out more about ourselves. Forfeiting the present moment in order to fantasize about the future is a trap. The immense, timeless moments of spiritual joy that are found in the beauty of nature or in quiet meditation are proof that time is a construct of the mind of humankind, and not necessarily mandatory for the human experience. If time is money, then life can be measured in dollars. This is total deception, because life is, in truth, absolutely priceless. 6. THE ILLUSION OF SEPARATENESS On a strategic level, the tactic of divide and conquer is standard operating procedure for authoritarians and invading armies, but the illusion of separateness runs even deeper than this. **We are programmed to believe that as individuals we are in competition with everyone and everything around us, including our neighbors and even [mother nature](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/21/ayahuasca-iboga-messengers-truth-mother-earth/). Us vs. them to the extreme.** We are constantly comparing ourselves against all around us using standards set by the hidden magicians.

This flatly denies the truth that all life on this planet is infinitely interconnected. Without clean air, clean water, healthy soil, and a vibrant global sense of community we cannot survive and thrive here. While the illusion of separateness comforts us by gratifying the ego and and offering a sense of control, in reality it only serves to enslave and isolate us. The more we recognize the interconnectedness not only between all members of humankind, but also with all of nature and the world around us, the more we welcome in a new paradigm in which the magician's veil is lifted and we all co-create lives based on deeper truths with ever greater choice and freedom. CONCLUSION The grand illusions mentioned here have been staged before us as a campaign to encourage blind acquiescence to the machinations of the matrix. In an attempt to disempower us, they demand our conformity and obedience. We must not forget that all of this is merely an elaborate sales pitch. They can't sell what we don't care to buy. Find the courage to pierce the magician's veil and open to much greater realities and you will be doing a great service to all of us. **About the author** [**Sigmund Fraud**](http://www.wakingtimes.com/contributors/sigmund-fraud/) is a survivor of modern psychiatry and a dedicated mental activist.

Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*\" Martin Luther King Jr., quote from his 1967 book *[Where Do We Go From Here?](http://www.amazon.com/Where-Do-We-Here-Community/dp/0807005711/sr=1-1/qid=1168723096/ref=sr_1_1/102-1859328-2876949?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books)* Dear WantToKnow.info readers, We celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his lasting memory and timeless teachings. From boldly shaping the U.S. civil rights movement to courageously giving voice to the devastating impacts of militarism and war, he served as a galvanizing moral force for transforming violence. King spoke repeatedly about the Greek concept of agape, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. Agape is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all men.\" *We rise to the position of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed he does ... If I respond to hate with a reciprocal hate, I do nothing but intensify the cleavage in broken community. I can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love ... Agape is a willingness to go to any length to restore community.* - Martin Luther King Jr. King was one of the greatest disciples of Mohandas Gandhi, who emphasized the power of a nonviolent mass movement to awaken consciousness within activism. Building off of Gandhi's teachings, King asserted that the means we use to influence others must be as pure as the ends we seek. **We are all products of our violent society, until we do the courageous work of transforming the violence in our own lives to transform the violence in the world. ** Gandhi and King believed that the nonviolent journey is one that affirms both our differences and fundamental unity with others. It is the process of becoming increasingly free from fear, transforming \"us\" vs. \"them\" in thought and action as we work for the well-being of all. **King's core teachings on nonviolence are explored below. ** In our efforts to expose major cover-ups and corruption, **we also explore eye-opening and important evidence revealing the deeper story behind the details of his assassination. ** With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) ***Stride Toward Freedom * King's Principles of Nonviolence** In [*Stride Toward Freedom*](https://www.amazon.com/Stride-Toward-Freedom-Montgomery-Legacy/dp/0807000698), King tells the classic story of the first successful large-scale application of nonviolent resistance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence.txt:0:b238550ca834", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10190, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "work for the well-being of all. **King's core teachings on nonviolence are explored below. ** In our efforts to expose major cover-ups and corruption, **we also explore eye-opening and important evidence revealing the deeper story behind the details of his assassination. ** With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) ***Stride Toward Freedom * King's Principles of Nonviolence** In [*Stride Toward Freedom*](https://www.amazon.com/Stride-Toward-Freedom-Montgomery-Legacy/dp/0807000698), King tells the classic story of the first successful large-scale application of nonviolent resistance in America: [the Montgomery bus boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott). He described his book as \"the chronicle of 50,000 Negroes who took to heart the principles of nonviolence, **who learned to fight for their rights with the weapon of love, and who, in the process, acquired a new estimate of their own human worth.\" ** Below are powerful excerpts from the book detailing King's six principles of nonviolent activism: 1. **Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people. ** Nonviolent resistance is not a method for cowards; it does resist. If one uses this method because he is afraid or merely because he lacks the instruments of violence, he is not truly nonviolent. **This is why Gandhi often said that if cowardice is the only alternative to violence, it is better to fight **... **The method is passive physically, but strongly active spiritually.** He made this statement conscious of the fact that there is always another alternative: no individual or group need [to] use violence to right the wrong; there is the way of nonviolent resistance. 2.** Seek to win friendship and understanding. ** It does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent. The nonviolent resister must often express his protest through noncooperation or boycotts, but he realizes that these are not ends themselves; they are merely means to awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent ... The aftermath of nonviolence is the creation of the beloved community, while the aftermath of violence is tragic bitterness. 3. **Defeat injustice, not people. ** A third characteristic of this method is that the attack is directed against forces of evil rather than against persons who happen to be doing the evil ... We are out to defeat injustice and not persons who may be unjust. 4. **Suffering for a cause can educate and transform**. Nonviolent resistance is a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation. **Unearned suffering is redemptive. **Suffering, the nonviolent resister realizes, has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities. Suffering is infinitely more powerful than the law of the jungle for converting the opponent and opening his ears which are otherwise shut to the voice of reason. But beyond its effect upon the aggressor, the voluntary suffering inspires respect from the uncommitted and ultimately leads to a growth of, and solidarity with, the ranks of the peacemakers. 5. ** Avoid external physical violence, as well as internal violence of the spirit.** The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence.txt:1:4ef4fe02e24b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10191, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__mlkjr-trial-nonviolence", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "realizes, has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities.

But beyond its effect upon the aggressor, the voluntary suffering inspires respect from the uncommitted and ultimately leads to a growth of, and solidarity with, the ranks of the peacemakers. 5. ** Avoid external physical violence, as well as internal violence of the spirit.** The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent but he also refuses to hate him. The nonviolent resister would content that in the struggle for human dignity, **the oppressed people of the world must not succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter or indulging in hate campaigns.** To retaliate in kind would do nothing but intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives. 6. **The universe is on the side of justice.** The believer in nonviolence has deep faith in the future. This faith is another reason why the nonviolent resister can accept suffering without retaliation. **For he knows that in his struggle for justice he has cosmic companionship... a creative force in this universe that works to bring the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole.** *The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.* - Martin Luther King Jr. ** Inquiring Deeper into Kings Assassination Interview with King Family Lawyer William Pepper ** *Now, what kind of man was he? A man of enormous courage. No matter how much money it cost him no matter how much his life became increasingly in danger, he stood firm on behalf of values, that he thought were essential human values. And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in factunconscionable. So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy. * William Pepper, personal friend to King and attorney for the King Family Audiences of corporate media may not have heard of bestselling author and human rights lawyer [Dr. William Pepper](https://williampepper.com/), and his decades of effort to expose the real story behind the assassination of King.

Edgar Hoover, elements within the military and intelligence agencies, the Memphis Police Department, and \"Dixie Mafia\" crime figures in Memphis, Tennessee.** Significant information on the trial is revealed below, as quoted by Pepper in the interview: *\"The King v. Jowers civil trial... went on for 30 days with some 70 witnesses. It was not covered by the media. The media just stayed away. Because of the degree of media control in matters of this sort, very few people know that trial took place. But it did. **And it took a jury 59 minutes to find that James Earl Ray had no involvement, knowing involvement, in the killing.**\" * * \"**Well, they had determined that they were going to kill him because of the two issues we've just been discussing. The [Vietnam] War was a very important monetary issue for major American corporations. **You know; at one point, John Downey, who was head of the military intelligence group, the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, used to brief [Lyndon] Johnson, President Johnson, on a very regular basis. And every time he would come back from Vietnam, he would brief him. And he would ask him: Why are we there? Why are we losing blood and treasure? What's behind all of this? What is the reason for it? It doesn't make any sense. And Johnson would ignore him for the most part. And, then, finally, one day, I guess he'd had too much or whatever, **he pounded the table; and he said: John, I can't get out of Vietnam.

Given the recent verdict, we are able to state the following: (1). We initially requested that a comprehensive investigation be conducted by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, independent of the government, because we do not believe that, in such a politically-sensitive matter, the government is capable of investigating itself. (2). The type of independent investigation we sought was denied by the federal government. But in our view, it was carried out, in a Memphis courtroom, during a month-long trial by a jury of 12 American citizens who had no interest other than ascertaining the truth. (Kings v.Jowers). (3). After hearing and reviewing the extensive testimony and evidence, which had never before been tested under oath in a court of law, it took the Memphis jury only one hour to find that a conspiracy to kill Dr. King did exist. Most significantly, this conspiracy involved agents of the governments of the City of Memphis, the state of Tennessee and the United States of America. The overwhelming weight of the evidence also indicated that James Earl Ray was not the triggerman and, in fact, was an unknowing patsy. (4.)

However, many of our readers in the PEERS community are aware of the significant challenges facing our news media systems. In this message, we'll explore useful ways we can better navigate the media landscape. This comes at a crucial time where society is rapidly changing, and the ongoing cultural political wars fuel imbalanced reporting, censorship, and sophisticated propaganda techniques. ** A [recent Gallup poll](https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Views-2022-Pt-2-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf) revealed that half of Americans believe news organizations deceive the public**. This may not come as a surprise. Our political systems seem to increasingly feel like a theatrical show or a confusing game of charades. Our choices and voices may feel irrelevant compared to the choices and voices of those in power shaping our world and the mainstream narrative. Who or what do we trust? Meanwhile, our ability to understand each other, talk to each other, and work together seems dangerously degraded. People cluster to media organizations that fit their belief, and dismiss other outlets. The internet, once thought to open the world up to all the information possible and bring people together, has instead drawn people into their own corners. Cognitive scientist and psychologist Dr. John Vervaeke calls this the Meaning Crisis, the pervasive feeling of alienation and disconnection from the world and from each other. **Vervaeke explains that a lack of meaning in life occurs when people become stuck in a rut, paralyzed by suboptimal assessments of the world such that they no longer feel like they fit into it well. **A lack of meaning makes it challenging to see beyond the boxes of our own limited thoughts and beliefs. **Each of us has the responsibility to face the world and make meaning of it in constructive ways. **Destabilization, apparent chaos, and change may initiate deeper questions that could help us uncover what's really going on. Enough events are happening in our world that are sending people on a meaningful search, whether that's from listening to podcasts, reading books, creating alternative communities, to adopting new ideas and ways of thinking. It seems as though any societal shift begins with a consciousness shift in how we think and relate to ourselves, others, and the world. The Purpose of Sensemaking To make better sense of the information landscape, we begin by reducing the noise inside and around us. Our society has a lot of noise. Endless opinions and biases flood both corporate and independent media platforms.

Endless opinions and biases flood both corporate and independent media platforms. Outrageous headlines and polarizing narratives weaponize our emotions, manipulating the public to take a certain side on a complex issue. Eroding quality of life makes it challenging to feel and think well, due to the degradation of our environmental, economic, and social systems fueled by corporate interests and captured government agencies. **This noise discourages our ability to emotionally regulate, see things clearly, and listen to each other.** In psychophysics, the Weber-Fechner Law states that the more noise in an environment, the less signal you hear. **A signal serves as a guiding force that gets us closer to a *felt* sense of truth about how the world works. **Yet to hear the signal, we can't just rely on our intellectual capacities. **The signal is the integration of our best critical thinking and our body-based knowing.** Embodiment coach and author Philip Shepherd says there are two basic modes of intelligence: mind (details, ideas, specifics, compare/contrast) and body (felt senses, gut intuition). Some of us may find that we often \"feel\" truth, not just think truth. Many call this a \"gut feeling\" where we sense that something carries truth *or* something feels off in what we're doing, even if we may not have information to prove it. It's no accident we use the term intuition and gut feeling interchangeably. Scientists now recognize that we have two brains. In addition to the familiar cerebral brain in the head, there is a \"second brain\" in the gut that is home to the enteric nervous system, over 100 million nerve cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. This brain, operating independently from the rest of the nervous system, sends constant, updated sensory information of our internal states to the brain via the [vagus nerve](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/vagus-nerve), which is responsible for modulating mood, relaxing tension, and maintaining homeostasis. *[Our culture] tells us that the head should be in charge, because it knows the answers, and the body is little more than a vehicle for transporting the head to its next engagement. It tells us that doing is the primary value, while being is secondary. It shapes our perceptions, actions, and experiences of life. It separates us from the sensations of the body and alienates us from the world. These cultural differences point out that we have lost some choice in how we experience ourselves. * *Our culture doesnt recognize that hub in the belly, and most of us dont trust it enough to come to rest there. And so we are stuck in the cranium, unable to open the door to the body and joinitsthinking.

And so we are stuck in the cranium, unable to open the door to the body and joinitsthinking. The best we can do is put our ear to the imaginary wall separating us from it and listen to the body, a phrase that means well but actually keeps us in the head, gathering information from the outside. But the body is not outside. The body is you. We are missing the experience of our own being. * *My work is not about \"listening to the body.\"** It's about listening to the world through the body******. ***- Philip Shepherd Almost every important decision you've made was based on what you *felt* about it. Consider the friends you choose, the people you fall in love with, the values you prioritize, or even choosing a color to paint with. Our intuition and felt sense of things are often more powerful than reason. Maya Angelou's classic quote speaks precisely to this, where she says that we will often forget what others say or do, but we won't ever forget how we felt around them. So although our thoughts are responsible for triggering reactivity and solving the real problems we need to address, we often feel things in our bodies first. **This can be an important signal if we pay attention to it. Our instinctual felt sense of things is like a muscle we can strengthen with intentional practice. ** So how do we apply this to our current media landscape? Everywhere you look, political bias infects much of mainstream and alternative media platforms. Instead of engaging in balanced inquiry about issues where we look at all sides and perspectives, we often only get one side of the story. Shepherd articulates that our culture misunderstands what information is: *We are addicted to \"digital\" information. **I don't mean literally information that comes to us through digital sources, but rather information that, like a digital signal, is made up of bits and pieces broken off from the whole**. We think that's real information.* *Ideas are seductive in their certainty and simplicity, but because any idea is a static construct, it stands independent of the present. **To give your allegiance to an idea is to turn away from the connected intelligence of your being.** I think the most dangerous people in the world are those who feel their ideas about the world more keenly than they feel the world itself, because they will be disconnected from what is in front of them and can act only out of their fantasy. **Holding fast", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__moving-beyond-loneliness-meaning-crisis-with-sensemaking.txt:2:574dbdda13f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10198, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "g__moving-beyond-loneliness-meaning-crisis-with-sensemaking.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "g__moving-beyond-loneliness-meaning-crisis-with-sensemaking", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "but because any idea is a static construct, it stands independent of the present. **To give your allegiance to an idea is to turn away from the connected intelligence of your being.** I think the most dangerous people in the world are those who feel their ideas about the world more keenly than they feel the world itself, because they will be disconnected from what is in front of them and can act only out of their fantasy. **Holding fast to an idea, because it's frozen, also promises to excuse you from having to change. **But harmony requires us to change along with the whole. If you open yourself to the hum of the world - if you live in the present rather than in your idea of it - it will change you. * Whether it's buying a product or voting for a candidate, the media is always selling us an idea, and often in polarizing ways. How do we think for ourselves and integrate the best of any message, along with our own ways of understanding? We have two tools to navigate: good critical thinking and sensemaking. Sensemaking involves the weaving of body-based intelligence that reduces our defenses, maintains emotional regulation, stays open to different ways of perceiving the world, and holds conflicting feelings while navigating the complex information we're getting from our media systems. Deborah Ancona, founder of the MIT Leadership Center, defines sensemaking as** **\"******creating space for listening, reflection and allowing different framings, stories and viewpoints to be shared and collectively explored.\"** The synthesis of different perspectives can create a more integrative worldview that doesn't seek to exclude or cancel any perspective. When we practice sensemaking in our media systems, **we strive to find signal in any perspective, whether it confirms our biases or challenges them. **Possibilities emerge for calm and open thinking, mutual respect, and effective communication. **To more easily detect the signal and reduce the noise, here are 10 approaches that weave critical thought and sensemaking. ** 1. **Slow down and breathe.** Slowing things down to notice where and why we get defensive or emotionally activated can greatly reduce the noise. The more regulated our nervous system is, the less we're pulled into the divisive, emotional narratives and dramas flooding our media systems.

Exploring conflicting views only adds, not subtracts, to the bigger picture. As David Rumelhart says, \"all knowledge is in the connections.\" 3. **Read, view, and listen to a diverse range of news sources to expand your media diet. **Notice what resonates with you without getting stuck in any echo chamber. A healthy diet is a diverse one; any one food eaten exclusively creates imbalance. 4. **Become more comfortable with looking at perspectives you may not agree with.** Its not our differences that divide us; its the judgments about our differences that do. Judgment alone narrows our thinking. Instead of shutting down, we *slow things down* to bring greater awareness of how our own biases and emotional states cloud our capacity to sit with conflicting information. 5. **Follow the money and power in corporate media. **Six corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read. [Becoming aware of the special interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgKv8rrqIpU) driving what gets covered (or not) on mainstream platforms can help us navigate censorship, propaganda and mis/disinformation campaigns that serve corporate interests over open, democratic debate. 6. **Support independent journalism. **Independent media platforms that arent owned or influenced by corporate interests often provide ample opportunities to access a broad spectrum of perspectives and voices. [Click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/independent-news-links/) for a comprehensive list of independent media sources. 7. **Be mindful of the overuse of the negativity bias. **The human nervous system has been evolving for 600 million years to avoid hazards and stay alive. This biological and psychological response is known as the \"negativity bias\" in which our minds and behavior are shaped by threats, real or unreal. **Medianarratives, often influenced by government and corporate special interests, can use powerful emotions of fearand anger to manipulate the public fortheirown benefit **by: 1) highlighting concern about a problem to help sell a remedy that they can profit from, or 2) aligning a dissenting message with something to be feared. Propagandists often use loaded words and name-calling to disparage any opposition to their message and sway public opinion (i.e. derogatory labels, discrediting or scapegoating those who question their narrative). 8.** Take in the good.** Teilhard deChardinstates that *the future belongs to those who give the next generation reason for hope.* Just as our negativity bias has helped us survive, foregrounding [stories and news that inspire](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) remind us of human goodness, and fosters collaboration and collective power.

Activism moves the material world, while art moves the heart, body and soul. A [touching article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123197292128083217) explores how jazz helped fuel the civil rights movement, bringing people of all skin colors to engage together on the dance floor without effort or force.

We cant make sense of our times alone. Others may have views that open up different insights, and each of us can serve as that person for others too in reducing groupthink and conformity occurring on all sides of the political spectrum.

The plans were developed as ways to trick the American public and the international community into supporting a war to oust Cuba's ... Fidel Castro. America's top military brass even contemplated causing U.S. military casualties, writing: \"We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba,\" and, \"casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation.\" The plans had the written approval of all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and were presented to President Kennedy's defense secretary, Robert McNamara, in March 1962. But they apparently were rejected by the civilian leadership and have gone undisclosed for nearly 40 years. The Joint Chiefs even proposed using the potential death of astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit as a false pretext for war with Cuba. Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, \"the objective is to provide irrevocable proof ... that the fault lies with the Communists.\" The scary thing is none of this stuff comes out until 40 years after. **Note:** Why was ABC the only major news source to report on this highly revealing story?

The most egregious example is General Electric. Last year the conglomerate generated $10.3 billion in pretax income, but ended up owing nothing to Uncle Sam. In fact, it recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 billion. How did this happen? It's complicated. GE in effect consists of two divisions: General Electric Capital and everything else. The everything else--maker of engines, power plants, TV shows and the like--would have paid a 22% tax rate if it was a standalone company. It's GE Capital that keeps the overall tax bill so low. Over the last two years, **GE Capital has displayed an uncanny ability to lose lots of money in the U.S. (posting a $6.5 billion loss in 2009), and make lots of money overseas (a $4.3 billion gain). Not only do the U.S. losses balance out the overseas gains, but GE can defer taxes on that overseas income indefinitely.** The timing of big deductions for depreciation in GE Capital's equipment leasing business also provides a tax benefit, as will loan losses left over from the credit crunch. But it's the tax benefit of overseas operations that is the biggest reason why multinationals end up with lower tax rates than the rest of us. **Note:** Can you believe that GE not only pays no taxes, they actually get credit from the US government?

The declassified document is called \"Information Operations Roadmap\". It was obtained by the [National Security Archive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/index.htm) at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks.

Shhhh, It's a Secret** **2008-12-22, Fox News/Associated Press** [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,470824,00.html](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,470824,00.html) It's something any bank would demand to know before handing out a loan: Where's the money going? But after receiving billions in aid from U.S. taxpayers, the nation's largest banks say they can't track exactly how they're spending the money or they simply refuse to discuss it. \"We've lent some of it. We've not lent some of it. We've not given any accounting of, 'Here's how we're doing it,\"' said Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, which received $25 billion in emergency bailout money. \"We have not disclosed that to the public. We're declining to.\" **The Associated Press contacted 21 banks that received at least $1 billion in government money and asked four questions: How much has been spent? What was it spent on? How much is being held in savings, and what's the plan for the rest? None of the banks provided specific answers. **\"We're not providing dollar-in, dollar-out tracking,\" said Barry Koling, a spokesman for Atlanta, Ga.-based SunTrust Banks Inc., which got $3.5 billion in taxpayer dollars. The answers highlight the secrecy surrounding the Troubled Assets Relief Program, which earmarked $700 billion-about the size of the Netherlands' economy-to help rescue the financial industry. There has been no accounting of how banks spend that money. \"It is entirely appropriate for the American people to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent in private industry,\" said Elizabeth Warren, the top congressional watchdog overseeing the financial bailout.

Just last week President Bush announced, \"my 2003 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending.\" More money for the Pentagon ... while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends. **\"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" Rumsfeld admitted. $2.3 trillion-that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.** A former Marine turned whistle-blower is risking his job by speaking out ... about the millions he noticed were missing from one defense agency's balance sheets.

That's what BlackLight Power, a 25-employee firm in Cranbury, N.J., says it can do. The only problem: Most scientists say that company's technology violates the basic laws of physics. Such skepticism doesn't daunt Dr. Randell Mills, a Harvard-trained physician and founder of BlackLight, who recently claimed that he has created a working fuel cell using the world's most pervasive element: the hydrogen found in water. Mills says he has a market-ready product: a fuel cell that produces a chemical reaction to alter hydrogen atoms. The fuel cell releases heat that turns water into steam, which drives electric turbines. The working models in his lab generate 50 kilowatts of electricity - enough to power six or seven houses. But these, Mills says, can be scaled [up] to drive a large, electric power plant. **The inventor claims this electricity will cost less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which compares to a national average of 8.9 cents.** Mills developed the patented cocktail that enables the reaction - a solid fuel made of hydrogen and a sodium hydride catalyst - only a year ago. (He recently posted instructions on the company's Web site, [blacklightpower.com](http://www.blacklightpower.com)). Now that the device is ready for commercialization, he says, BlackLight is negotiating with several utilities and architecture and engineering firms. **The business, Mills says, has attracted $60 million in funding from wealthy individuals, investment firms ... and it is no longer seeking money. **BlackLight's board of directors reads like a Who's Who of finance and energy leaders. **Note:** For two *New York Times* articles showing the viability of this amazing technology, [click here](http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2008/10/21/21venturebeat-blacklight-power-bolsters-its-impossible-cla-99377.html) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2008/10/21/21gigaom-blacklight-validates-physics-defying-hydrogen-pow-12760.html).

If there were a magic bullet, though, it might be something like dichloroacetate, or DCA, a drug that kills cancer cells by exploiting a fundamental weakness found in a wide range of solid tumors. So far, though, it kills them just in test tubes and in rats infected with human cancer cells; it has never been tested against cancer in living human beings. DCA ... is an existing drug whose side effects are well-studied and relatively tolerable. Also, it's a small molecule that might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach otherwise intractable brain tumors. Within days after a technical paper on DCA appeared in the journal Cancer Cell last week, the lead author, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule. It acts in the body to promote the activity of the mitochondria. Researchers have assumed that the mitochondria in cancer cells were irreparably damaged. But Michelakis wondered if that was really true. With his colleagues he used DCA to turn back on the mitochondria in cancer cells-which promptly died. **One of the great things about DCA is that it's a simple compound, in the public domain, and could be produced for pennies a dose. But that's also a problem, because big drug companies are unlikely to spend a billion dollars or so on large-scale clinical trials for a compound they can't patent. **([Anyone interested in helping can click here](http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.cfm).) **Note:** Thank you *Newsweek* for publishing this important article.

Bonesmen, as they're called, are forbidden to reveal what goes on in their inner sanctum. Bones has included presidents, cabinet officers, spies, Supreme Court justices, [and] captains of industry. They'd responded to questions with utter silence until an enterprising Yale graduate, Alexandra Robbins, managed to penetrate the wall of silence in her book, *Secrets of the Tomb*. \"I spoke with about 100 members of Skull and Bones. They were members who were tired of the secrecy,\" says Robbins. \"But probably twice that number hung up on me, harassed me, or threatened me.\" Skull and Bones, with all its ritual and macabre relics, was founded in 1832. Since then, it has chosen or \"tapped\" only 15 senior students a year who become ... lifetime members of the ultimate old boys' club. A lot of Bonesmen have gone on to positions of great power. **President Bush ... tapped five fellow Bonesmen to join his administration. Bonesmen have [included] William Howard Taft, the 27th President; Henry Luce, the founder of Time Magazine; and W. Averell Harriman, the diplomat and confidant of U.S. presidents. Mr. Bush, like his father and grandfather before him, has refused to talk openly about Skull and Bones.** But as a Bonesman, he was required to reveal his innermost secrets to his fellow Bones initiates.

Covert operators kicked around the idea of creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or showing other such manly weaknesses, or in some sexually compromising situation. The nascent plan was for the tapes to be flooded into Iraq and the Arab world. The tape war never proceeded ... but the \"strategic\" PSYOPS scheming didn't die. **What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad urging the Iraqi people and Army to rise up against Saddam? According to a military physicist given the task of looking into the hologram idea, the feasibility had been established of projecting large, three-dimensional objects that appeared to float in the air.** A super secret program was established in 1994 to pursue the very technology for PSYOPS application. The \"Holographic Projector\" is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to \"project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.\" **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops).

The documents ... suggested broader experimentation on unwitting humans by the intelligence agency or its paid researchers than had been publicly known before. Mr. Marks distributed 20 documents that described the following incidents, among others: In 1956, the C.I.A. contracted with a private physician to test \"bulbocapnine,\" a drug that can cause stupor or induce a catatonic state, on monkeys and \"convicts incarcerated at\" an unnamed state penitentiary. **A letter from an unnamed C.I.A. official in 1949 discussed ways of killing people without leaving a trace. \"I believe that there are two chemical substances which would be most useful in that they would leave no characteristic pathological findings,\" the letter said.** In 1952, two Russian agents who were \"suspected of being doubled\" were interrogated using \"narcohypnotic\" methods.

The two men were given sodium pentothal and a stimulant. One interrogation produced a \"remarkable\" regression, the papers said, during which \"the subject actually relived certain past activities of his life. The subject totally accepted Mr. [name deleted] as an old and trusted and beloved personal friend whom the subject had known in years past in Georgia, U.S.S.R.\" The C.I.A. conducted secret medical experiments from 1949 through 1963 under the code names Bluebird, Artichoke, MK Ultra and MK Delta. **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/770721nytimes.ciahumanbehaviorcontrol).

Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms in any fashion) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken Miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep) and failing this, she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to \"kill\" [deleted] for failing to awaken. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions to the letter including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. **Both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence. Miss [deleted] was again handed the gun, which she refused (in an awakened state) to pick up or accept from the operator.

His new book, [*The Ground Truth*](http://www.amazon.com/Ground-Truth-Untold-America-Attack/dp/1594488940/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253982885&sr=1-1), picks up where the commission left off - taking a deeper look at the government's ... response to the attacks and exposing officials determined to hide their failings from the inquiry. Farmer uses newly released transcripts and recordings to cast doubt on the official version of events. He spoke with TIME. [Time:] Why do you think officials tried to obscure [the truth about 9/11]? [Farmer:] It's almost a culture of concealment. You have someone like Sandy Berger ... taking rather extreme measures to remove documents from the National Archives and hide them at a construction site where he could retrieve them later and destroy them. **There were interviews made at the FAA's New York center the night of 9/11 and [those tapes were destroyed](https://www.WantToKnow.info/faadestroyed911tape). The CIA tapes of the interrogations were destroyed. The story of 9/11 itself, to put it mildly, was distorted and was completely different from the way things happened.** If what the government is telling you isn't true, then the truth could be anything. I think there is evidence that the truth wasn't told and that at least some of that was deliberate. **Note:** Many respected scholars, officials and professionals have questioned the 9/11 Commission's report.

The One-Party State **By Timothy Silver** Perhaps the most widely proliferated truism of American patriotism is that the the two-party system is a beacon of democracy. Surely, our system is better than that of Iran, where presidential candidates must be approved by a religious council, or perhaps that of Venezuela, where the majority of the media is state-owned and disseminates propaganda in each election. Democrats and Republicans are widely different, it seems. At least that is what their hyper-partisan bickering would imply. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama must be unabashed liberals, otherwise why would the Republicans despise them so much? **The divide between party faithfuls of different colors runs deep, with each side blaming the entirety of the country's problems on the other, often resulting in a state of pure hatred and disgust among citizens.** One only needs to turn on cable news to see this as a fact. **However, the reality is that Republican and Democrat presidents have closely followed a similar agenda for half a century.** The idea that American governance alternates as a sort of give-and-take between liberalism and conservatism is little more than a fantasy. I do not discount that there may be serious and significant differences between Democrat and Republican individuals, many of them members of Congress, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:g__one-party-state-us.txt:0:7d7a749fe9bc", "wtk_id": NaN}]
