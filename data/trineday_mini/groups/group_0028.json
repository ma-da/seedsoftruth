pediatrics is the delivery channel for the childhood immunization program that s why it exists And the MMWR is put out by the CDC which is recommending the program So this is propaganda and it is put out by those parties most interested in defending the outcome The researchers analyzed nine vaccines targeted by the CDC s Vaccines for Children Program which provides free vaccines to about half of American children They sought to quantify the effects of those vaccines since the program began in 1994 However they included data for all vaccinated children not just program recipients Vaccines included diphtheria tetanus and pertussis DTP or DTaP Haemophilus influenzae type b or Hib poliovirus measles mumps and rubella or MMR hepatitis B varicella hepatitis A pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus They calculated costs associated with immunization including costs of the vaccines and administration parent travel and work time lost taking children to get vaccinated and adverse events They compared those with benefits of vaccination which included medical costs saved by not having to treat a disease parent travel and work time that would have been lost in caring for a sick child and other similar benefits They concluded that routine childhood immunizations remain a highly cost effective public health intervention preventing thousands of lifetime illnesses hospitalizations and deaths among children born during 1994 2023 The analysis didn t include flu COVID 19 and HPV vaccines or the RSV monoclonal antibodies and other vaccines recently added to the CDC s childhood immunization schedule Objectively ridiculous Biggest benefit comes from diphtheria vaccine The CDC estimated the cumulative number of illnesses prevented ranged from 5 000 cases of tetanus to approximately 100 million cases each of measles and chickenpox The highest number of deaths prevented was 752 800 from diphtheria which accounted for more than half of the deaths prevented and based on Zhou s 2009 study for more than half of the costs saved But Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer at Children s Health Defense said the mortality rates they used for diphtheria were highly inflated Hooker said The mortality rates they used of 15 20 were reported prior to the development of the vaccine in the 1920s However this was prior to the development of antibiotics Corynebacterium diphtheriae the bacteria that causes diphtheria is treatable with penicillin or erythromycin Blaxill said diphtheria was a disease of the horse drawn economy caused by a bacteria found in horse manure It s caused by environmental exposures and it s not infectious and it isn t common really anywhere anymore He added that incidents of diphtheria had gone down dramatically long before 1994 when the

revaccination every 10 years even for adults most of whom do not get that booster So they are claiming excessive benefits of vaccination that are heavily skewed to an ancient vaccine that no one cares about Blaxill said Over half of the benefits they claim come from diphtheria That s objectively ridiculous The next largest benefit claimed was over 100 million measles cases prevented 13 2 million hospitalizations avoided and 85 000 deaths prevented However Blaxill said it is the same thing with measles by the time vaccines rolled out mortality rates from measles were extraordinarily low According to the CDC s data the death rate from measles declined by 98 between 1900 and 1962 When the measles vaccine came out in 1963 the mortality rate had already declined to 0 2 per 100 000 people as of 1960 or a case fatality rate of 2 per 10 000 None of the vaccines available through the Vaccines for Children Program are as effective as the CDC claims Rogers said We know that the mumps portion of MMR does not work The pertussis portion of DTaP does not stop infection nor transmission of pertussis That s true for lots of vaccines on the schedule Rogers said it is well documented in books like Dissolving Illusions Disease Vaccines and the Forgotten History by Dr Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk that there were 90 to 100 reductions across all childhood infectious diseases before the introduction of mass vaccination campaigns Study excluded a century of economic progress from analysis Study limitations the authors wrote were that by not including flu COVID 19 and RSV immunizations they could be underestimating the benefits of the shots They also said they could be underestimating vaccination costs In other words the costs may be even higher than they think and the benefits even greater However they also conceded that for some diseases other public health interventions like better hygiene could have lowered disease risk in recent decades and their analysis did not account for that If such reductions were substantial the model would overestimate the vaccine preventable incidence of these diseases they wrote In other words Blaxill said A century of economic

Rogers added We are not living in the 1600s contrary to whatever the CDC might think Today we have access to antibiotics antivirals and targeted treatments such as vitamin A for measles Hooker agreed He said most of the mortality rates the CDC used to make its calculations came from decades or even a century ago and didn t account for all of the important public health advances and societal changes Hooker said it s important to remember that in this day and age infectious diseases aren t the boogeyman because of the availability of treatments If a child gets chicken pox they recover Missing costs epidemic of childhood diseases Critics also said that during the period covered by the study there was an explosion of chronic illness among children often linked to vaccination with astronomical economic and societal costs that are unaccounted for in the CDC s cost calculations Blaxill and Rogers co authored the seminal Autism Tsunami study which projected the societal costs of autism would grow to 1 36 trillion annually by 2040 and continue to rise after that a number that dwarfs the savings the CDC claims Blaxill said that to claim vaccines could save trillions of dollars they had to add up estimated savings over 30 years whereas chronic illnesses like autism would be generating such costs annually He also accused the CDC of claiming cost savings without evidence For example they claimed that vaccines provided a societal benefit in reducing special education expenditures Where is there evidence that special education costs have gone down he asked Rising rates of ADHD autism and other developmental disorders have led to such costs exploding in the other direction he said The CDC report authors did include in their calculations a very conservative cost of

from 13 U S healthcare organizations CNN reported Biologist Christina Parks Ph D said the study should examine the CDC s childhood vaccination schedule The cumulative effect of giving multiple vaccines at once as well as over a short period of months has not been studied as a potential contributing factor to autism Parks said Vaccines have the potential to alter a child s immune system in ways that are unexpected Parks referred to studies performed in 1970 and 1987 that found autism rates of 0 7 and 3 3 children per 10 000 respectively If autism were as prevalent then as it is now we should have a large number of older autistic adults which we do not Parks said Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for CHD suggested the CDC study should use an unvaccinated control group Hooker cited his experience performing research using data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink noting that the database already contains data on unvaccinated children A 2021 study co authored by Hooker found that vaccinated children were significantly more likely than unvaccinated children to be diagnosed with autism Ji said any CDC study examining a possible vaccine autism link should reflect Kennedy s recent calls for gold standard science He said It must be a true gold standard study The methodology must be rigorous transparent and independent with no industry or government interference It should be a prospective controlled long term study comparing fully unvaccinated and vaccinated populations Hooker said the CDC has previously not made data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink

suffer from conflicts of interest flawed methodologies and a lack of truly unvaccinated control groups According to Hooker many previous studies were flawed because they focused only on a limited number of vaccines and vaccine components The CDC and most of the open peer reviewed literature focuses on one vaccine and one vaccine component the MMR measles mumps rubella vaccine and thimerosal a mercury based preservative used in some vaccines A 2013 study found a link between thimerosal exposure and the risk of an autism diagnosis Recent independently performed studies have indicated a

risks for schools and children On this week s Defender In Depth Suzanne Burdick Ph D and Jenny DeMarco who has a master s in education told host Michael Nevradakis Ph D that cell tower contracts far from offering easy money often lock in school boards for decades at unfavorable terms Burdick a reporter for The Defender is writing a series of investigative articles on wireless exposure at schools DeMarco is communications director for Virginians for Safe Technology and co founder of the National Call for Safe Technology Burdick said legal wireless radiofrequency RF exposure limits are outdated They added that school districts often fail to inform parents before signing such contracts while environmental impact studies are typically not conducted They also said the Federal Communications

those advancements by ramping up its efforts to roll out its infrastructure However in doing so it s really been targeting and I might say taking advantage of school boards and school leaders Burdick said Burdick said schools looking for new income streams see tower installation as a way to generate passive income Yet what appears at first glance as a no brainer to school leaders comes at the cost of not realizing the implications of this in terms of how long the contracts are the possible health ramifications and how little proper government oversight there is on the industry Burdick said DeMarco has advocated against such contracts at her children s private school and other schools in her area She said a local high school signed a 35 year tower contract which contains an initial 10

may know that the dam of denial is going to break at some point and they don t want it to affect their revenue when it does Many times the contracts allow the telecom companies to modify the towers maintain them or change them Burdick said This could mean that an initial placement of one antenna could later unilaterally be converted to a whole bunch of 5G antennas Burdick noted instances of contracts that allowed telecom companies to provide a mere 48 hours notice before adding to their tower sites or where school boards approved cell tower contracts after 48 seconds of discussion In the latter case parents in Wyandotte Michigan grew really understandably irate because the school board didn t consult them before signing the contract The parents sued T Mobile and obtained a restraining order blocking the activation of the antennas However on appeal their case was dismissed and the antennas were activated Parents are now appealing It s very much torn that community apart in that many parents pulled their kids out of the school Burdick said It s been a real mess DeMarco noted that despite contract terms that initially appear enticing Big Telecom contracts often provide schools with only limited financial benefits as other than a relatively large upfront payment when the contract is signed annual lease rates are low and are often split among all schools in the district and the tower company It s a tiny drop in the bucket for which you re putting people at risk DeMarco said School board democratic processes often lacking as parents are shut out DeMarco and Burdick both said

or with counties including the Virginia county where she resides which she said used emergency powers enacted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic to rush through such contracts with little oversight or review COVID powers gave one man in our county the ability to sign off on any cellphone infrastructure within the county she said It didn t have to go through the planning process any public notice none of it DeMarco also said school boards typically don t conduct environmental impact studies before signing off on contracts or before the construction of wireless towers They basically just sign off and that s it Burdick and DeMarco said school boards often cite safety concerns such as an expanded ability to call 911 to justify the placement of wireless towers at schools DeMarco said that while doing that school boards tend to conceal the possible adverse health effects of the radiation emitted by wireless towers noting that her local school authorities omitted it from the conversation as if it doesn t exist or have claimed that such health dangers were never proven to exist In conversations with tower company owners DeMarco said she s been told these companies only have to worry about compliance with FCC regulations but don t have to worry about safety Burdick said the FCC s RF exposure limits were set in 1996 based on studies conducted in the 1970s and 80s They look only at

determined there was no appropriate basis to amend its RF exposure limits and closed its inquiry CHD and other organizations filed lawsuits against the FCC in 2020 challenging this determination In 2021 a federal appeals court ruled the FCC failed to consider all of the scientific evidence regarding the adverse health effects of wireless technology and required it to conduct a new review of the evidence Yet the FCC has so far defied the ruling Burdick noted that CHD has continued to put pressure on the FCC to act petitioning the FCC last year and planning a new legal filing in the coming months She cited several recent studies finding potentially serious health risks connected to RF exposure including in elementary school students and adolescents FCC rules also don t take into consideration the cumulative effects and long term impacts of RF exposure DeMarco said noting that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prevents state and county authorities from making decisions on wireless tower applications based on environmental effects which includes health impacts We should be using the precautionary principle specifically when dealing with children DeMarco said Burdick said CHD is leading the way in challenging the FCC s rules including through online resources for the public and legal cases one in New Jersey others citing the Americans with Disabilities Act

just five minutes of having an idle cellphone placed on her leg The same thing happened when researchers held the cellphone an inch away from the woman s body according to a peer reviewed study published April 23 in Environment Science and Policy for Sustainable Development Using ultrasound the researchers showed that the woman s blood cells developed a rouleaux formation an abnormal red blood cell pattern in which the cells stack together in long rows like piles of coins according to MyHematology com Dr Robert Brown the study s author said that although the impact of rouleaux formation on health is not well understood it s not without potential health consequences Brown is a diagnostic radiologist with more than 30 years of experience and the vice president of Scientific Research and Clinical Affairs for the Environmental Health Trust EHT He said Because of the impact on gas exchange and increased blood viscosity due to clumping it is possible rouleaux could account for the unusual uptick in once uncommon disease processes and disorders increasing in our society over the past few decades including hypertension obesity diabetes strokes particularly in the younger population and others According to Brown the study is key to educating the medical community on how wireless radiation affects a person s biological functioning If we want to see a change in government regulations and a decrease in the indiscriminate usage of wireless technology the allopathic medical community needs to become knowledgeable of the health effects of wireless communication radiation Brown said I believe this study has cracked the proverbial egg Devra Davis Ph D MPH a toxicologist and epidemiologist who is founder and president emerita of the EHT said This finding of

researchers did another ultrasound The second ultrasound showed that cellphone radiation caused the blood cells in the woman s popliteal vein located behind the knee to clump in rouleaux formation Brown and Biebrich repeated their experiment with the same woman multiple times over three months Each time we encountered the same results Brown wrote On one occasion the woman s blood cells were already in rouleaux formation before having the cellphone placed on her knee for five minutes Although we were initially perplexed Brown wrote I asked the participant where she had kept her cellphone just before the scan and she replied that it had been in her pocket The researchers also altered the experiment by placing the cellphone an inch away from the woman s skin rather than placing it directly on her body Again they waited five minutes She went into rouleaux even with the cellphone exposure an inch away Brown wrote By demonstrating rouleaux in a deep leg vein the study confirms that the penetration and associated physiological effects of wireless radiation are not limited to the first few millimeters of skin but do in fact occur deeper in the body Brown said This finding has significant implications for safety he said The Federal Communications Commission s safety exposure limits for wireless radiation are based on the assumption that the radiation can harm human health only at levels high enough to heat human tissue Cellphones emit radiation at levels lower than that Many scientists including Brown say there s evidence that non thermal levels of wireless radiation

high cellphone use was associated with reduced male fertility measures But experts criticized the authors for speculating newer phones emit less radiation and for their ties to a group aligned with telecom industry interests Men who frequently use their cellphones may suffer from lower sperm counts than those who do not according to a new Swiss study that adds to the mounting body of evidence showing a link between cellphone use and decreased male fertility The study found that men who used their phones more than 20 times a day had significantly lower sperm counts and decreased sperm concentrations two critical measures of male fertility than men who used their phones just once a week These men had roughly 21 higher risk of sperm counts and 30 higher risk of sperm concentrations falling below the World Health Organization s reference values for fertile men The authors of the study which tracked the health data and cellphone usage data of 2 886 young men from 2005 to 2018 said the link between cellphone use and lower sperm counts was more pronounced in the first period of the study 2005 and 2007 and decreased progressively over the subsequent time periods 2008 2011 and 2012 2018 They attributed the differences to newer wireless technologies which they said emit less radiofrequency RF radiation Do newer technologies really emit less radiation Experts like Lennart Hardell M D Ph D a world leading scientist on cancer risks from radiation took issue with the authors suggestion that newer wireless technologies emit less radiation The authors gave an overgeneralized

epidemiology and public health at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute Rӧӧsli told Forbes the link between phone use and sperm counts lessened over time periods corresponding to the transition from 2G to 3G networks and from 3G to 4G networks because the newer networks led to a reduction in the transmitting power of phones If the amount of power as in energy is lower that would

health It s not accurate to make a blanket statement that 4G or 3G devices emit more power or energy in all cases Singh told The Defender The specific power levels emitted by a mobile device can vary based on the device s design its antenna and how it s used he said adding Some 3G devices may have higher power requirements than some 4G devices and vice versa the power or energy emitted by a 4G mobile device can vary depending on network conditions the device s power efficiency and how it s being used W Scott McCollough chief litigator for CHD s electromagnetic radiation EMR cases agreed The claim that higher generations such as 4G versus 3G emit less power is an overgeneralization since there are several physical factors that determine the power output of wireless devices Plus we are seeing multiple generations at the same site McCollough said Wireless companies commonly run both LTE which is 4G and 5G on the same cell tower each with its own power output With the greater numbers and concentrations of transmitting towers people may be exposed to more not less RF radiation McCollough said Wireless industry experts interviewed by the scientific research and education nonprofit Environmental Health Trust EHT said 5G antennas emit RF radiation as a concentrated rather than a diffused beam with output power 20 to 35 times more than 4G Dr Marc Arazi founder and president of the

interests such as being a member of ICNIRP ICNIRP and the U S Federal Communications Commission in the 1990s adopted RF exposure limits based on the assumption sometimes called the thermal only paradigm that harm could only come at radiation levels high enough to heat tissues ICNIRP in 2020 reaffirmed its guidelines based on the same assumption despite substantial scientific evidence showing biological effects at non thermal levels Researchers in 2023 accused ICNIRP of basing its 2020 guidelines largely on studies done by its own members and ignoring scientific studies showing harm could occur at radiation levels below what s needed to cause tissue heating The researchers said With its thermal only view ICNIRP contrasts with the majority of research findings Hardell agreed ICNIRP is basically a product defense organization he said meaning it acts like a scientific authority in order to protect telecommunication companies by ignoring and discrediting research that shows their products may be unsafe Additionally Hardell and Michael Carlberg in a 2020 paper noted that many ICNIRP members including Rӧӧsli sit on other key international committees that make decisions on what

So it s concerning when their data show a clear increase Mona Nilsson co founder and director of the Swedish Radiation Protection Foundation told The Defender The Danish Cancer Registry on Sept 30 published a report on the number of new cancer cases in Denmark Nilsson said It shows that central nervous system tumors have been increasing among both men and women Nilsson compared Danish central nervous system cancer diagnosis rates since 1995 The data show that tumors of the central nervous system including brain tumors are increasing and are among the cancers that have increased most rapidly over the past 10 years between 2014 and 2023 The Danish statistics contradict the notion that the rate of brain tumors isn t on the rise Nilsson said That argument has been used to claim that cellphone use is not linked to an increased risk of brain tumors or cancers in general A 2023 study on brain cancer rates worldwide from 1990 2019 found a significant rise in brain cancer among both men and women in nearly all parts of the world The study authors noted that this increase was largely seen in Western countries In the U S overall brain and other nervous system cancer rates haven t

did a multi year study concluding there was clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of wireless radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cellphones developed cancerous heart tumors and some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats When the NTP in 2018 released its findings the FDA rejected the study and in February 2020 released an unsigned literature review that criticized the study Commenting on the increased incidence of brain tumors Eckenfels Garcia said So essentially this is an I told you so moment This is exactly what happens when our captured government agencies ignore science as the FDA did with the NTP study Moskowitz said the FDA should have followed up on the NTP study by conducting a formal risk assessment of wireless radiation but that never happened Instead the U S government shut down NTP s follow up work on its 2018 study In April CHD filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Institutes of Health NIH for

and take it down tomorrow and leave no record of what they posted unless some user somewhere happened to take a screenshot Even then there is no way to verify its authenticity The standard approach to know who said what and when is now gone That is to say that the whole internet is already being censored in real time so that during these crucial weeks when vast swaths of the public fully expect foul play anyone in the information industry can get away with anything and not get caught We know what you are thinking Surely this DDOS attack was not a coincidence The time was just too perfect And maybe that is right We just do not know Does Archive org suspect something along those lines Here is what Archive org said Last week along with a DDOS attack and exposure of patron email addresses and

seeking just below the live version They have plenty of server space to enable that now but no that service is now completely gone In fact the Google Cache service officially ended just a week or two before the Archive org crash at the end of September Thus the two available tools for searching cached pages on the internet disappeared within weeks of each other and within weeks of the November 5th election Other disturbing trends are also turning internet search results increasingly into AI controlled lists of establishment approved narratives The web standard used to be for search result rankings to be governed by user behavior links citations and so forth These were more or less organic metrics based on an aggregation of data indicating how useful a search result was to internet users Put very simply the more people found a search result useful the higher it would rank Google now uses very different metrics to rank search results including what it considers trusted sources

that created it was independent Then one day in 1999 it was bought by Amazon That seemed encouraging because Amazon was well heeled The acquisition seemed to codify the tool that everyone was using as a kind of metric of status on the web It was common back in the day to take note of an article somewhere on the web and then look it up on Alexa to see its reach If it was important one would take notice but if it was not no one particularly cared This is how an entire generation of web technicians functioned The system worked as well as one could possibly expect Then in 2014 years after acquiring the ranking service Alexa Amazon did a strange thing It released its home assistant and surveillance device with the same name Suddenly everyone had them in their homes and would find out anything by saying Hey Alexa Something seemed strange about Amazon naming its new product after an unrelated business it had acquired years earlier No doubt there was some confusion caused by the naming overlap Here s what happened next In 2022 Amazon actively took down the web ranking tool It didn t sell it It didn t raise the prices It didn t do anything with it It suddenly made it go completely dark No one could figure out why It was the industry standard and suddenly it was gone Not sold just blasted away No longer could anyone figure out the traffic based website rankings of anything without paying very high prices for hard to use proprietary products All of these data points that might seem unrelated when considered individually are actually part of a long trajectory

online at discounted prices directly to consumers who have a prescription The Fierce Pharma list included other executives from some of the top vaccine manufacturers Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla ranked third with a total compensation of 24 6 million his second highest annual salary after his 33 million payout in 2022 when Pfizer was reaping massive profits from its COVID 19 vaccine and its antiviral Paxlovid The CEOs of Johnson Johnson and AstraZeneca also made the list even after the disastrous outcomes for their COVID 19 vaccines Johnson Johnson s shot associated with serious and life threatening blood clots is no longer available in the U S AstraZeneca similarly had to withdraw its vaccine from global sales in 2024 after conceding the shot caused potentially fatal blood clots

his stock options for more than 392 million that year Such payouts have been ongoing at least since the COVID 19 vaccines first became available In 2020 Bancel came under fire when he more than tripled the number of company shares to be sold through an executive stock plan that was changed just days after the company announced positive early results for its COVID 19 vaccine Bancel sold more than 72 000 Moderna shares in July 2020 generating nearly 4 8 million According to CBS News that was more than triple the 22 000 shares he had previously scheduled to sell during the same period

pointed to one especially powerful influence over whether a person will get a vaccine a clear recommendation from their doctor Throughout most of her career Nola Ernest a pediatrician in rural southeastern Alabama could reassure families who were hesitating to vaccinate their kids in many cases by explaining that she had enthusiastically opted into the same shots for her own sons In the past few months though she s spoken with several families who at her recommendation had previously immunized all of their older kids and yet are now adamant about not vaccinating their newborn I reassure them that I am still the same pediatrician Ernest told me They say We still trust you We just think a lot of the things have been pushed on us for a long time that were not actually necessary or were harmful A recent KFF tracking survey found that about three fourths of Republicans trust their physician to provide reliable information about vaccines but about three fourths trust President

and Research said fluoride supplements have never undergone a formal approval process and called for a fresh risk benefit review Fluoride advocates including dentists and pediatric experts argued that low dose supplements remain safe and critical for children in areas without water fluoridation The FDA has proposed removing these supplements from the market citing research on gut microbiome disruption and possible links to thyroid issues and reduced IQ though some studies remain inconclusive Fluoride has long been added to public water supplies to reduce tooth decay but its use in supplements for children without access to fluoridated water has drawn scrutiny Health advocates argue the mineral prevents cavities especially in low income communities while critics cite studies

social media according to new research A study released Monday found that using smartphones before age 13 could damage kids mental health Smartphone use by children younger than 13 was associated with suicidal thoughts worse emotional regulation lower self worth and detachment from reality especially among girls according to the study which was published in the Journal of the Human Development and Capabilities For every year before age 13 that a person acquired a smartphone their mental health and well being were likely to be lower the study found That s likely because the kids who used smartphones before turning 13 accessed social media more and experienced sleep disruptions cyberbullying and negative family relationships according to the study The data is based on self reports in a survey of nearly 2 million people in 163 countries The results were so stark that the researchers called for global restrictions to prevent children younger than 13 from using smartphones and social media This calls for urgent action limiting access of children under 13 to smartphones as well as more nuanced regulation on the digital environment young people are exposed to said lead study author

the responses the public health agencies would provide anyway Given those findings the researchers hope ChatGPT can be an effective tool to help reduce vaccine hesitancy among the general public They also found similar results for advice about STIs For the study researchers from the National University Health System in Singapore tested how ChatGPT would respond to common questions about vaccination The researchers who run infectious disease clinics asked ChatGPT 15 commonly asked questions on vaccine hesitancy including questions about efficacy adverse effects and cultural concerns They also asked 17 questions about risk factors access to care and prophylaxis for STIs Two independent infectious disease experts compared ChatGPT s answers about vaccines to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP They assessed ChatGPT s answers on STIs against the 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines According to the press release ChatGPT provided factual responses and reassurance to vaccine hesitancy concerns using the public health agencies statements as the basis for determining fact For example the chatbot highlighted recommendations for measles vaccination in low income settings and discussed the benefits of HPV vaccination but failed to discuss age limits for vaccination ChatGPT also addressed

cases it is beginning to displace typical search engines or Wikipedia as a go to source for information As AI begins to be used in medicine many researchers and AI designers have celebrated its potential as an administrative tool for writing research and generating patient information Politico said 2024 may be the year artificial intelligence transforms medicine Forbes and BMC Medical Education both claimed AI is revolutionizing healthcare However generative AI tools have proven extremely unreliable in diagnosing health conditions A study published in January in JAMA Pediatrics found ChatGPT misdiagnosed 83 of children s health conditions The researchers in that study explained that chatbots are typically non specifically trained on a massive amount of internet data which can often be inaccurate They do not discriminate between reliable and unreliable information but simply regurgitate text from the training data to generate a response This is significant according to The New York Times because people tend to adopt ideas they are repeatedly exposed to The Times reported last month on a new preprint study that found AI language models like ChatGPT had clear political biases based on its moral judgments the way they frame their answers which information they choose to share or omit and which questions they will or won t answer The Times also noted that the responses given by language AI models like ChatGPT are determined by the inputs that train them the data they draw from and especially the fine tuning done by system designers The misinformation that the researchers in the study from the National University Health System Singapore are concerned about is the same misinformation the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA deems problematic Since

beliefs At least two previous studies also tested ChatGPT s ability to combat misinformation although both focused only on the COVID 19 vaccine Research published last year in the journal Cureus reported ChatGPT could successfully be used to combat COVID 19 conspiracy beliefs and that it responded with clear concise and non biased content ChatGPT s success it said could be seen in responses where the software was dismissive about conspiratorial ideas regarding COVID 19 origins labeling it as non credible and lacking scientific evidence meaning the software dismissed the lab leak theory and instead repeated the World Health Organization s talking point that the virus had a natural animal origin No evidence has been found for the zoonotic origins of COVID 19 with a bat as the article claims Substantive evidence from internal government documents released through Freedom of Information Act requests has suggested a lab leak is the more likely of the COVID 19 origin theories The software responses in that study also confirmed that the vaccines had undergone rigorous safety testing there was no evidence that pharmaceutical companies obscured any data about adverse effects and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks However those responses contradict what is known about how the vaccines were rushed through the regulatory process and how vaccine makers overstated the efficacy and understated risks of the vaccines A second study published in September 2023 in Human Vaccines Immunotherapeutics made similar findings The researchers asked the software the 50 questions most posed to World Health Organization collaborators about the COVID 19 vaccines and had public health professionals evaluate the responses It concluded that ChatGPT offers information consistent with existing scientific evidence effectively debunking many myths circulating on social media which could potentially promote a higher vaccine uptake After those studies mainstream scientific publications celebrated ChatGPT s ability to debunk vaccine myths and increase vaccine uptake The Defender chats with ChatGPT The Defender also chatted with ChatGPT to test its answers on

masks are an essential tool in reducing the spread of COVID 19 The Defender According to Cochrane systematic review on masks they are not effective at reducing the spread of respiratory viruses ChatGPT In July 2020 Cochrane published a systematic review on the effectiveness of physical interventions including masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses such as COVID 19 This review analyzed data from studies conducted before the COVID 19 pandemic and found limited evidence to support the effectiveness of wearing masks in preventing the transmission of respiratory viruses in the community However it s important to note that the findings of this review were based on evidence primarily from studies conducted prior to the COVID 19 pandemic and did not specifically focus on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID 19 Since the review s publication numerous studies have provided evidence supporting the effectiveness of masks especially in reducing

no conclusive evidence linking the HPV vaccine to autoimmune disorders Numerous large scale studies and systematic reviews have found no significant association between HPV vaccination and autoimmune disorders While isolated reports of adverse events following HPV vaccination including autoimmune disorders may occur extensive monitoring systems continue to evaluate vaccine safety These systems

170 lawsuits in federal court from people who suffered a range of serious injuries after taking Gardasil including autoimmune disorders premature ovarian failure and cancer There are also over 200 Gardasil injury claims pending in the vaccine court The Defender also experimented with several questions with premises that clearly diverged from the regulatory agencies official positions on vaccination such as Can increased cancer rates be linked to the COVID 19 vaccines Is there a link between vaccines and some autism Has there been DNA contamination caused by mRNA vaccines To those

Utility Commission s interpretation of the state s 2008 law mandating smart meters You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Eighty safe technology and environmental organizations on Sept 15 joined the amicus brief in the court case challenging the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission s PAPUC interpretation of Pennsylvania s Act 129 a 2008 law to mandate smart meters and deny disability accommodation to people adversely affected by pulsed radio frequency RF radiation emitted by wireless devices including smart meters Children s Health Defense CHD filed the amicus brief in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania An amicus brief is filed by non parties to a litigation to provide information that has a bearing on the issues and assist the court in reaching the correct decision It comes from the latin words amicus curiae which means friend of the court Smart wireless utility meters have been deployed in the U S for a decade replacing the analog mechanical meters that for decades were used reliably and safely and were read monthly by meter readers They were promoted as part of the 2008 stimulus program as an investment in energy conservation Smart meters contain transmitting antennas that continuously communicate electric usage to the utility company in real time They allow companies to punish users for using electricity during high demand periods and reward them for using it at less busy times Smart meters now leading cause of sickness especially in children A decade after they were introduced there is little to no evidence smart meters saved any energy Instead ample evidence shows that consumers had to carry a rate hike to fund the ever increasing costs of these meters False readings by the meters have resulted in much higher bills for consumers The meters have caused fires and violated privacy rights by selling consumers usage data But by far the worst consequence of widespread use of smart meters is that they have become a leading cause of sickness in adults and children To support the claims of adverse effects from exposure to smart meters the amicus brief filed by CHD included a statement by scientists with expert knowledge of the impact of electromagnetic fields EMF and RF on human health Cumulatively these scientists have published hundreds of studies on RF EMF effects and reviewed thousands of others They explain how smart

meters contain transmitting antennas that wirelessly transmit the data to the utility companies They pulse intense levels of RF radiation up to 190 000 times a day some exceeding even Federal Communications Commission s FCC allowed levels The report explains how RF emissions from the antennas and the spikes of RF frequencies created by the meter s Switch Mode Power Supply s AC DC conversion process enter the house s electric wiring transforming the entire house into an antenna Signers of the amicus brief argued these meters must not be forced on those who are affected from RF exposure and these people should be provided instead with analog meters What s at stake The original case was filed in Pennsylvania by four consumers who are suffering adverse reactions from exposure to wireless radiation They asked to be accommodated and were refused by PECO the local utility company and later by the PAPUC The plaintiffs appealed to Pennsylvania s Commonwealth Court which had ruled in October 2010 that the law does not mandate smart meters All parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which agreed to hear the appeals The risk posed by this case to everyone is imminent said Dafna Tachover of We Are The Evidence The court s decision will affect not only Pennsylvania residents but will have far reaching implications nationwide If the position of consumers and safe tech organizations is rejected there is little doubt that industry will mandate smart meters across the country In fact the push by utility companies to mandate smart meters has been growing as these meters are part of Smart Grid and the Internet of Things network Tremendous health improvements after smart meters removed The nationwide rollout of smart meters is based on the assumption they are safe because they comply with the FCC guidelines However the amicus brief refers to the recent decision by the U S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in CHD s case challenging the FCC s

and therefore the meters cannot be regarded as safe CHD also revealed in the brief that the FCC admitted to adverse neurological responses from RF frequencies including frequencies in the range emitted by the smart meter SMPS 2 50 KHz The symptoms referenced by the FCC are similar to the symptoms reported by people who claim to suffer adverse effects from the smart meters Symptoms include tingling a feeling of electric shocks sleep and cognitive problems The amicus brief also includes a statement signed by 57 physicians who jointly treat more than 3 000 patients adversely affected by exposure to wireless devices and infrastructure Most of these patients suffer from electrosensitivity also known as radiation microwave sickness a condition in which people develop various symptoms

Gust explained that the organization s experts have witnessed both the widespread sickness created by smart meters and the tremendous health improvements after these meters are removed Regarding the interpretation of Pennsylvania s 2008 Act 129 CHD argued the PAPUC s interpretation of the law is false claiming the statute which is an opt in statute cannot be read to contain a universal mandate

statement of interest in an antitrust lawsuit filed by Children s Health Defense CHD and a group of independent journalists against the Trusted News Initiative TNI a partnership formed by several of the world s largest news organizations The lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that TNI violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by collectively colluding with tech giants to censor independent news outlets in a move designed specifically to cripple the smaller publishers ability to compete TNI members include legacy media giants the BBC The Associated Press Reuters and The Washington Post The case had languished until last week when the U S Department of Justice DOJ filed its five page notice with the U S District Court for the District of Columbia In its notice DOJ attorneys said that cases addressing anticompetitive collusion among competitors over product features are a particular concern of the federal government The DOJ said it intends to file its statement of interest within the next three weeks by July 18 According to Renata Hesse co chair elect of the American Bar Association s Antitrust Law Section the DOJ occasionally files statements of interest in cases before federal district courts when it wishes to inform the court about some legal principle that is an issue in a case and related to its competition mission CHD CEO Mary Holland called the DOJ s announcement a welcome development noting that federal enforcement of antitrust law in recent years has been lax Kim Mack Rosenberg CHD s general counsel said That the DOJ which obviously has an interest in the enforcement of federal law including antitrust law is stepping in here hopefully means this case will move forward The interest of the DOJ may accelerate the case now and I am awaiting the statement

You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The court should not have dismissed a lawsuit filed last year by Children s Health Defense CHD and 13 students challenging Rutgers University s COVID 19 vaccine mandate policy according to the plaintiffs attorneys In a reply brief filed March 2 in the U S Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit attorneys for CHD and the students argued the district court erred when it dismissed the case The appeal disputed whether as a university Rutgers has the authority to mandate vaccination It also challenged the dismissal on the basis of informed consent contesting the notion that an experimental drug can be mandated at all After CHD appealed the ruling in January Rutgers and CHD filed reply briefs The court may next set up a panel to hear oral arguments but it can issue a decision at any time CHD v Rutgers raises significant issues which will have a profound impact on all students attending college in New Jersey and possibly across the nation Julio C Gomez of Gomez LLC lead counsel in the case told The Defender He continued These issues include whether colleges and universities can mandate experimental vaccines during a pandemic even though the health authorities of the state departments of health governors state legislatures chose not to do so The case also raises the most important issue of all whether every person has a fundamental constitutional right to informed consent and to refuse unwanted medical treatment Do you have the right to say no to experimental medical treatment without coercion We are hopeful that the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals will schedule oral arguments to address these important questions History of the case and current arguments In the original lawsuit filed in August 2021 CHD and the students sued Rutgers University its board of governors Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and others over the university s decision to mandate COVID 19 vaccines for students attending school in the fall The lawsuit alleged Rutgers policy is a violation of the right to informed consent and the right to refuse unwanted medical treatments It also alleged that because Rutgers was working with Pfizer Moderna and Johnson Johnson to study and develop their vaccines in ongoing clinical trials it would benefit financially if more people are required to take the shots More than a year after CHD sued

the legal standard in a motion to dismiss Gomez told The Defender in January The appeal also continued to underscore the original allegations regarding Rutgers lack of authority to impose a mandate and the students right to informed consent Rutgers attorneys argued in their brief responding to the appeal that the university has the legal authority to mandate student vaccination for any vaccine that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP recommends CHD disagreed arguing that ACIP requires recipients to have the option to refuse experimental vaccines a right Rutgers did not afford to students who wished to remain enrolled in the University ACIP acknowledges a student s right to exercise informed consent freely Rutgers does not CHD s response brief stated Rutgers attorney also justified the university s right to mandate the COVID 19 vaccine for all students by pointing to the 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson v Massachusetts which addressed the smallpox vaccine as precedent In that case the court found that a state may require all residents to take a vaccine without exemptions if a rational basis exists to determine that such a step is necessary to mitigate a public health emergency CHD said Rutgers arguments were not informed by a fair reading of Jacobson It said in this case there was no evidence when the mandate was imposed in fall 2021 or now that Jacobson v Massachusetts would apply If the state of science is such that it is premature or it cannot be determined if these products are safe and effective then Rutgers is not capable of making any determination that they can protect public health or public safety and could not possibly satisfy the requirement in Jacobson that these vaccines have a real and substantial relation to the object of protecting people on campus CHD argued that both Rutgers and the district court judge failed to take into consideration the fact that COVID 19 is not a vaccine preventable disease so the vaccines do not protect people from infecting one another in the way implied in the mandate rationale Rutgers ignored the fact that the plain language of state

Children s Health Defense is appealing the dismissal of a federal lawsuit challenging the authority of the U S Food and Drug Administration to grant Emergency Use Authorization of COVID 19 vaccines for children You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Children s Health Defense CHD is appealing the dismissal of a federal lawsuit challenging the authority of the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to grant Emergency Use Authorization EUA of COVID 19 vaccines for children CHD on Tuesday filed an appeal in the U S Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit seeking to reverse the decision by a lower federal court the U S District Court for the Western District of Texas which dismissed the suit in November 2022 The complaint initially was filed in January 2022 The FDA along with its commissioner Dr Robert Califf are named as defendants in the lawsuit Aside from CHD five parents of children who are directly threatened by FDA s authorizations and the false advertising of its EUAs are named as plaintiffs According to the appeal This case is about the FDA s misuse and misappropriation of emergency powers to market an unsafe dangerous biologic to little children in order to deny them informed consent The Constitution intended courts to address precisely this kind of case or controversy This case asks one basic question in the critical context of mandated vaccines is the FDA above the law For example can FDA use its emergency power to push dangerous biologics on minors mislabel and misbrand them to the public with the express knowledge that their mislabeling would lead to them being coercively administered to children and infants as young as 6 months old The District Court ruled yes finding that the FDA cannot be sued by citizens and is beyond judicial review for any of its actions in this context The FDA claims it is above the law and denies any remedy to children aged 6 months to eleven years including those in foster care from its arbitrary and capricious authorization of COVID 19 injections According to Lexis Anderson an associate attorney with Barnes Law a Los Angeles based firm representing the plaintiffs This appeal seeks to correct a grievous wrong preventing dangerous agency action from being judicially redressed as the Constitution clearly embraces and intends The least protected most vulnerable lives of children and infants in this country depend on it Anderson added The appeal argues that the District Court erred in finding that CHD an organization dedicated to the health of children and that worked tirelessly to expose

plaintiffs have clearly alleged an actionable violation of federal law due to the FDA s inadequate agency review and decision making and subsequent false advertising of COVID 19 shots Kim Mack Rosenberg acting outside general counsel for CHD described the case against the FDA as critically important She told The Defender The plaintiffs ask a fundamental question here When it comes to mandated vaccines is the FDA above the law The district court by its decision dismissing the complaint answered that question in the affirmative The district court decision opens the door to FDA continuing essentially unchecked misuse of its emergency powers to push dangerous products on some of the most vulnerable members of society infants and young children The Constitution intended that courts could review the actions of government agencies By its decision the district court shut the courthouse doors and insulated the FDA from liability This is the opposite of the system of checks and balances the Constitution requires Because of these high stakes literally life and death in some cases it is very important for us to appeal this decision Also remarking on the appeal Mary Holland CHD president on leave told The Defender More and more science is now confirming that the FDA s authorization of the COVID shot for children aged 5 to 11 was arbitrary It is critical that the appeals court review the lower court s decision rigorously and do justice Parents directly threatened by EUAs allowing COVID vaccines for children The lawsuit was preceded in May 2021 by a citizen petition filed by CHD with the FDA in which CHD asked the FDA to revoke the existing EUAs for the COVID 19 vaccine In a 52 page response dated Aug 23 2021 the FDA denied CHD s petition The denial led CHD and the other plaintiffs to sue the FDA on Jan 24 2022 They filed an amended complaint on July 1 2022 alleging the FDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act APA The lower court dismissed the lawsuit

constitutional precedent The District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiffs lacked constitutional standing to sue the FDA and therefore could not bring this claim Anderson said The appeal states the secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services determined on March 27 2020 that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID 19 pandemic Subsequently in December 2020 the FDA issued EUAs for COVID 19 vaccines produced by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna while later EUAs were granted to Johnson Johnson and to Novavax The appeal notes that on Oct 29 2021 FDA revised the EUA to authorize administration of the Pfizer vaccine to children ages five to eleven Later on June 17 2022 the FDA further revised the EUA to authorize the administration of the Pfizer vaccine to children ages 6 months to 4 years According to the appeal The FDA states on its website that there is an option to accept or refuse receiving the vaccine and The FDA also states that s hould you decide for your child not to receive it it will not change your child s standard medical care However the five parents who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit are directly threatened by FDA s authorizations and the false advertising of the EUAs the appeal argues adding that FDA s alleged misrepresentations regarding the safety of their EUAs have led to continuous and even daily coercion propaganda and advertisements aimed directly at those children The appeal cites several examples For instance Appellant Deborah Else attests to enduring vaccine propaganda from school administrators and pediatricians aimed directly at her children And Sacha Dietrich declared under oath that her children experience constant harassment from directives and pressure to receive the COVID 19 biologic from the media and other children Else and Dietrich who are Texas residents also face an additional threat According to the appeal state law and policy puts their children in imminent risk of being injected with FDA s vaccine against their parents wishes According to the appeal This is due to the fact that under certain circumstances the applicable provisions of the Texas Family Code expressly provide that any number of persons and even non persons other than a child s parents may indeed provide consent to be injected with the EUAs at issue", "chunk_id":

persons and entities include but are not limited to a child s guardian a non parental family member a stepparent any adult in actual care of the child and even an educational institution or a court of law the appeal notes Regarding the threat Texas parents face Ray Flores senior counsel to CHD told The Defender It appears the district court wrongly dismissed the first amended complaint since plaintiffs alleged more than a speculative threat of harm from vaccination by a non parent Minors consent to vaccination is one of CHD s gravest areas of concern Texas law provides insufficient safeguards to prevent vaccination without parental knowledge or consent Flores said several Texas counties only require a consenting adult to provide permission for vaccination He told The Defender Waco County s consent form requires only the signature of a consenting adult This is not inconsistent with Texas state law that allows for relatives educational institutions courts and peace officers to consent when a parent cannot be contacted Each county within the Western District of Texas has a COVID 19 vaccine consent form that must be completed for a child s receipt of a COVID 19 vaccine However for minors there is no provision on the form that assures that the adult consenting for the minor is indeed the child s parent or legal guardian or even one of the individuals authorized under Texas statutes to consent According to the appeal Appellants children have repeatedly and continually faced the unrelenting and looming threat of being pushed out of society as the culture of mass vaccination and medical mandates now directed at children as young as 6 months continues as a result of FDA s issuance of EUAs that violate the APA The Administrative Procedures Act protects the public from arbitrary and capricious executive branch action by requiring an agency to engage in reasoned decision making Anderson told The Defender She argued this was not the case when the FDA granted EUAs for the administration of the COVID 19 vaccines to children FDA s granting of these EUAs for children violated the APA because in doing so the FDA abused its power under the emergency use

that the appellants suffered other injuries including their inability to rely on FDA marketing any longer resultant health uncertainty for their children risk of involuntary childhood injection of dangerous biologics and enormous costs to CHD to correct FDA s misinformation As a result the appeal argues that the lower court s order of dismissal was erroneous and must be vacated Amidst

Defense CHD has petitioned the U S Supreme Court to get New York kids back to school CHD and seven New York families with medically vulnerable children took the New York State Department of Health to court in June 2020 The families filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Northern District of New York that challenged restrictive new regulations on the medical exemption to the state s vaccine requirements In New York all children are required to receive on average 50 doses of vaccines on a schedule following guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC To attend any private or public school children must be fully up to date at the start of the school year unless they have a medical exemption Pursuant to statute if any physician licensed by the state certifies that the child is at risk of harm from the vaccine the child is supposed to be exempt In August 2019 however unelected officials at the state s health department dramatically undercut the statutory medical exemption protections without any direction from the legislature to do so The state issued a new regulation that takes clinical judgment away from treating physicians and predefines what may cause harm as a narrow list of conditions and contraindications contained in the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Best Practices Guidelines The CDC itself cautioned in an email to one of the plaintiffs that the guidelines cannot be safely used for this purpose they are not population based do not include all the reasons an individual child may need to be exempt and cannot be substituted for clinical judgment based on the best available up to date evidence and a child s individual medical history Under the new definition hundreds of known vaccine reactions do not qualify for exemption Even established serious adverse reactions in vaccine package inserts and conditions routinely compensated as presumptive injuries in vaccine court are excluded Some of the

the definition of what may cause harm the Department of Health has deputized school principals to decide if the treating doctor s medical exemption is correct All seven families submitted medical exemptions from one or often multiple licensed physicians certifying that their children are at risk of serious harm or death from a vaccine Each child was expelled from school after school principals with no medical training overruled doctors evidence based determinations After families filed suit in June 2020 rather than work with the families the Department of Health issued guidelines directing schools to exclude the children even from remote learning Although the families filed for temporary relief pending resolution of the lawsuit the District Court and Second Circuit denied even that access On January 22 the families applied to the Supreme Court for an Emergency Injunction pending appeal These policies are not only cruel and inhuman they violate clear Supreme Court precedent stated Sujata Gibson lead attorney for the petitioners Medical exemptions are supposed to be vigorously protected from this kind of state overreach These exemptions are related to the most sacred constitutional right we have the right to life which certainly includes the right to protect our children s lives from products that doctors certify could harm or kill them According to Gibson the Supreme Court has already held that if a physician licensed by the state certifies that a medical exemption is necessary the state cannot subject that exemption to further review or substitute its judgment for that of a treating physician At this stage families ask only that the children join online education All schools in the state have distance learning options It is impossible for any disease transmission to occur through the computer These kids pose zero risk said Mary Holland CHD general counsel who along with Robert F Kennedy Jr Michael Sussman Jonathan Goldman and Stephen Bergstein and Gibson form plaintiffs legal team It is an outrage that the state is depriving them of an online education The families hope that the Supreme Court will afford them relief so that the children don t fall further behind while this case wends its way through the lower courts It is barbaric to put these children at risk of serious harm or death in the name of public health said Gibson

California on Tuesday held oral arguments in a case brought by Children s Health Defense CHD against Meta Platforms Inc also known as Facebook its independent fact checkers and Mark Zuckerberg CHD alleges Facebook entered into an agreement with the White House to censor an entire category of speech de platformed CHD Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr and removed CHD s donate button on Facebook directing traffic instead to a third party fact checking organization that solicits donations CHD sued Facebook in August 2020 and filed an amended complaint in December 2020 The federal district court in the Northern District of California dismissed the case on June 29 2021 Judge Illston in a 45 page decision said CHD s allegations that Facebook is effectively a state actor on behalf of the federal government and engaged in false advertising and racketeering failed to state legal claims CHD appealed resulting in an argument held Tuesday with CHD attorneys Kennedy and Jed Rubenfeld Under U S Supreme Court precedent in Skinner v Railway Lab Execs Ass n Rubenfeld argued on appeal the case should not have been dismissed by the lower court because CHD made sufficiently plausible allegations and did not need to prove its case nor could it without targeted factual discovery to establish the full scope of Facebook s agreements to suppress COVID misinformation Rubenfeld made the following arguments to a three judge panel The Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC worked jointly to effect censorship of what they defined as COVID misinformation on Facebook s platforms Their partnership objectives were specific enough to encompass Facebook s warning labels imposed upon CHD s posts Facebook removed CHD s donation button and instead directed readers to the CDC s website or Facebook s fact checking organizations Kennedy s Instagram account with 800 000 followers was de platformed as a result of the agreement Federal actors and Facebook acknowledged partnering with one another to take down misinformation as defined by CDC officials the Biden administration and powerful congressional members Facebook was threatened with potential antitrust action and loss of liability protection under the Communications Decency Act Section 230 if the company did not participate in these actions The three judge panel was composed of

of New York sitting by designation Judge Korman seemed skeptical of CHD s assertion that congressional and administration pronouncements about Facebook s Section 230 liability protection and monopoly status could be real threats Kennedy in turn argued that when the Speaker of the House the White House and key chairs of powerful congressional committees act in concert to exert pressure to coerce Facebook to censor COVID 19 misinformation or else the threat is existential Kennedy argued that Congress had subpoenaed Zuckerberg to appear that liability protection as a publisher is the heart and soul of Facebook s business model and that the government s threat was literally to annihilate the company should it not comply Judge Collins later summarized this government gambit neatly Nice immunity you have there Facebook It d be a shame if anything happened to that Facebook attorney Sonal Mehta argued Facebook s censorship was the result of its independent judgment She acknowledged that while Facebook may have a common interest with the government to suppress misinformation and even to coordinate with the government CHD had not alleged enough to suggest joint action Mehta further argued that because Facebook has neutral immunity to publish or to refrain from publishing anything it wishes under Section 230 there was no state action The attorney for Poynter Institute one of the fact checkers sought to distance it from the lawsuit suggesting that Poynter fact checked only one fact in the lawsuit acting as an utterly independent journalist and had been inappropriately

sufficiently specific to which Rubenfeld responded they were quite specific Rubenfeld said then White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki clearly referenced Kennedy among the so called Disinformation Dozen whom she pronounced should be de platformed from Facebook and other social media platforms Rubenfeld further argued that precedent shows the required test for joint action is cumulative and a

plaintiffs LeTrinh Hoang D O Physicians for Informed Consent and Children s Health Defense California Chapter According to the motion AB 2098 prohibits physicians from conveying information and advice to their patients about COVID 19 which the State of California believes to be inconsistent with the prevailing opinions of the U S public health authorities and the majority of the medical community However if the pandemic has taught the world anything it teaches that the views and edicts of the U S public health and medical authorities have changed sometimes quickly dramatically and often inconsistently The plaintiffs requested the Osteopathic Medical Board of California be prohibited from investigating or sanctioning any osteopathic physician under Section 2270 pending the final judgment in CHD s lawsuit One of the six declarations attached to the motion is from Dr Sanjay Verma whose expert declaration presents numerous examples of public health authorities having to walk back their recommendations The declaration also details points of vagueness and the general unsuitability of using contemporary scientific consensus as a disciplinary criterion Verma s overview of the public health response to the pandemic is broken down into nine distinct categories and appendices Evolving and contradictory mask consensus Changing and contradictory statements about the ability of the vaccines to prevent infection Vaccine safety Vaccine efficacy Disparaging or underestimating natural immunity Unvaccinated dying at 11 times greater than fully vaccinated Examples of changes to

heart attacks Kaiser doctors eventually admitted that the COVID 19 vaccination was the likely cause In her declaration Pousada said While there is a possibility my medical and legal situation can improve in 2023 if AB 2098 is deemed constitutional that possibility is significantly diminished for me And it would be even worse for people suffering COVID 19 vaccine injury in 2023 and beyond because their physicians will not be willing to document their observation of so called misinformation necessary to resolution of legal claims Plaintiff Hoang a California licensed osteopathic physician for more than 25 years explained in her declaration some of the questions she is asked by patients and their families about issues related to COVID 19 Sometimes her advice is supported by mainstream medical literature However she finds it difficult if not impossible to robotically parrot propaganda that does not reflect true evidence based scientific consensus Often Hoang said her advice paints a more nuanced and personalized picture for her patients contemplating taking the vaccine or the boosters but she is concerned that under the new law she would put her license at risk Dr

medical exemptions from school vaccine mandates CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg appealed to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP during the public comments section of Wednesday s meeting ACIP s guidelines finalized in 2014 are not exhaustive and only broadly define contraindications and precautions for vaccines they can t capture all of the reasons a child may need a medical exemption Mack Rosenberg said The document includes a table page 54 with a partial list of contraindications and precautions for commonly used vaccines For example a person who is severely immunocompromised is advised not to take the dengue vaccine and anyone who has experienced an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any vaccine is advised to take precautions when taking any type of vaccine in the future The guidelines also include a table of conditions page 63 of incorrectly perceived contraindications or precautions For instance the guidelines state that having a fever a seizure or collapsing within 48 hours of receiving a DTaP vaccine does not qualify as a contraindication However the guidelines also state that the decision to administer DTaP to a child with a suspected neurological disorder should be made on a case by case basis page 61 Medical exemptions should be based on clinical judgment Mack Rosenberg said But too frequently doctors fear negative blowback if they write exemptions And often when they do provide an exemption many states and schools are overriding treating physicians clinical judgments and limiting exemptions to only those based on reasons explicitly listed in your non exhaustive tables or going even further accepting only anaphylaxis as a valid exemption ignoring other serious risks or reasons that a vaccine might need to be deferred The formation of a new committee offers an opportunity to address this problem she said She urged members to change the guidelines or issue a clear public statement on the website clarifying

s Health Defense CHD on Tuesday petitioned the Federal Communications Commission FCC to quit stalling and comply with a court ordered mandate to explain how the agency determined its current guidelines adequately protect humans and the environment against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency RF radiation The U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit issued the mandate on Aug 13 2021 when it ruled the FCC failed to consider the non cancer evidence of adverse health effects related to wireless technology when the agency determined its 1996 health and safety guidelines regarding wireless based technologies adequately protected public health The ruling stemmed from CHD s historic win in a case challenging the FCC s decision not to review the 1996 guidelines The FCC has taken no action to comply with the court s ruling prompting CHD to threaten further legal action Scott McCollough lead attorney for CHD s historic case and author of the petition said CHD submitted a petition rather than a request because a petition is something to which they must respond according to administrative law CHD s petition said The Commission cannot just sit on this matter any longer Any continued non action will violate the judgment and mandate and expose the Commission to further judicial review and ultimately a mandamus order requiring action In its 2021 decision the court said the agency must also address the environmental impacts of RF radiation and the impact of RF radiation on children the health implications of long term exposure to RF radiation the ubiquity of wireless devices and other technological developments that have occurred since the Commission last updated its guidelines McCollough a telecommunication and administrative law attorney told The Defender The FCC needs to receive all the evidence and science regarding the biological effects of RF radiation and deal with it in good faith The agency must recognize that its current guidelines need to be changed to reflect reality FCC cannot responsibly ignore this science any longer CHD s petition is the latest legal move in an ongoing battle stemming from the FCC s 2019 decision to not

wireless technology which they alleged the FCC had ignored in rendering its 2019 decision The U S Court of Appeals in 2021 sided with CHD calling the FCC s 2019 decision arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider the non cancer evidence regarding adverse health effects of wireless technology The court noted that the FCC failed to respond to approximately 200 comments on the record by people who experienced illness or injury from electromagnetic radiation sickness Moreover the court said the FCC completely failed to acknowledge let alone respond to comments concerning the impact of RF radiation on the environment The record contains substantive evidence of potential environmental harms It has now been three years and more than three months since the FCC s 2019 decision CHD s petition pointed out During that period even more scientific evidence has been published and it provides even more proof of a harmful biological response to RF exposures at and under the FCC s emissions guidelines the petition said The Environmental Health Trust arduously uploaded all recent scientific studies to the FCC case s docket so the FCC is fully aware of these developments the petition said The Commission cannot responsibly ignore this science any longer it added FCC has to find a better balance According to the petition the FCC must address the environmental impact of RF

chairman and chief litigation counsel and Mary Holland CHD president and general counsel filed the suit in the U S District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of plaintiffs Dr LeTrinh Hoang Physicians for Informed Consent and Children s Health Defense California Chapter The lawsuit which seeks a preliminary injunction alleges that California Assembly Bill 2098 AB 2098 violates physicians First Amendment and free speech rights by prohibiting them from sharing information with their patients if it is inconsistent with what the law refers to as contemporary scientific consensus and the standard of care The notion that the state can limit the information patients can receive from their doctors about deeply personal and important matters is constitutionally intolerable Jaffe said If the pandemic has taught us anything it has taught us that there is no international scientific consensus on most of the important scientific questions about the pandemic Different countries have taken different approaches to lockdowns and mandates and the U S has done surprisingly poorly among industrialized countries he added Holland also commented on the law The

misleading data regarding prevention of hospitalizations and death posing troubling questions including the unexplained rise in all cause mortality among younger population subsets According to the complaint Hoang a Los Angeles based pediatric osteopath would like to provide information to her male patients between ages 17 39 of the increased risks of cardiomyopathy and other cardiac serious adverse events of the mRNA shots This information is evidence based and widely reported in the medical literature the complaint states However if AB 2098 takes effect according to the complaint this type of evidence based advice could be viewed as contrary to the vague and undefined contemporary scientific consensus which the law may view as a departure from the standard of care As a result Hoang

children all of the vaccines recommended by the CDC Children s Health Defense CHD is supporting the lawsuit filed April 25 in the U S District Court for the Central District of California Santa Ana Division Dr Samara Cardenas lost her medical practice after the CDC Vaccines for Children Program kicked her out of the program because she wouldn t give COVID 19 vaccines to healthy kids California like most states requires pediatricians who treat Medicaid patients to be enrolled in the Vaccines for Children Program The program in turn requires doctors to strictly follow the CDC s childhood immunization schedule In late 2023 the Vaccines for Children Program informed Cardenas that her vaccine orders were being scrutinized for not including COVID 19 shots She was later expelled from the program As a result she lost her Medicaid contract forcing her to close her practice The Vaccines for Children Program primarily serves low income populations by providing free vaccines to uninsured or underinsured children and children who are eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid Medicaid compensates pediatricians for the costs associated with administering the vaccines In her first of its kind

science Attorney Rick Jaffe who represents Cardenas said this is the first federal lawsuit challenging the CDC s coercive use of the VFC Vaccines for Children program to enforce experimental emergency authorized COVID 19 vaccination as a condition of Medicaid access Cardenas followed her conscience and the science Jaffe said The VFC framework gave her no choice vaccinate all kids or lose access Kim Mack Rosenberg CHD general counsel said the lawsuit places policies that disproportionately affect Medicaid recipients under scrutiny as the Vaccines for Children Program s policy essentially mandates these experimental shots for a population historically vulnerable to medical experimentation Cardenas is not seeking compensatory damages Instead the lawsuit seeks to compel the CDC to abandon its misguided and scientifically untethered policy and stop the unnecessary mass vaccination of the nation s poorest children We re asking the court to say the government can t make scientific compliance a prerequisite to serving poor patients Jaffe said Pediatrician Dr Michelle Perro said that by requiring physicians to administer all vaccines on the childhood vaccination schedule medical autonomy is abolished while low income children are left with fewer options and less continuity of care Perro said many doctors are reluctant to oppose these policies The threat of speaking out is financial ruin and the potential loss of their ability to practice Perro said This is coercion and harassment The unknowns are enough to never let these products anywhere near children In October 2022 ACIP the CDC s vaccine advisory panel unanimously recommended adding COVID 19 vaccines for children as young as 6 months old to the CDC childhood schedule The complaint alleges that before making that recommendation the CDC failed to compile and analyze vaccine injury data It also alleges that ACIP is compromised by conflicts of interest as many of its members have financial or professional ties to vaccine manufacturers or related interests for which the CDC has granted conflict of interest waivers According to the complaint by not presenting evidence of the vaccine s clinical benefit ACIP violated the

Los Angeles County courthouse on the opening day of a trial that will determine if the county s plan for the uncontrolled expansion of wireless infrastructure violates state law Children s Health Defense CHD and a coalition of community and environmental groups including Fiber First LA sued Los Angeles County in March 2023 after county officials passed two ordinances allowing telecommunications companies to install wireless infrastructure without environmental review or public input Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James C Chalfant heard arguments in the case and said he plans to hear more arguments probably next week before rendering a decision Tuesday s hearing was a historic day according to Brenda Martinez a Los Angeles County resident and founding member of Fiber First LA Martinez who also is a fellow with CHD s Electromagnetic Radiation EMR and Wireless program said at a press conference during the rally that low income communities like hers are tired of being used as an excuse to justify the rollout of wireless infrastructure We re here representing millions of people in communities impacted by the digital divide she said Tuesday According to the World Economic Forum building out the 5G wireless technology will fix the digital divide But Martinez said she believes closing the digital divide won t happen by passing ordinances that allow for the fast tracked proliferation of inefficient fire hazardous and expensive wireless technology Martinez said This lawsuit is about getting Los Angeles County to listen to its constituents she said We will speak louder and clearer Martinez told The Defender she and others represented in the lawsuit are concerned about how wireless radiation may affect the health of their community members especially children and the elderly and the environment In addition to CHD and Fiber First LA plaintiffs in the suit include Mothers of East LA Boyle Heights Community Partners United Keetoowah Band

including that the county s ministerial review process for wireless project applications is little more than a closed door rubber stamping process devoid of the public s input McCollough told The Defender The people who are impacted get no notice they have no opportunity to object or even propose changes he said The plaintiffs will argue its other claims including that the county s ordinances violate the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA by exempting projects under the ordinances from CEQA review at the next hearing which has yet to be officially scheduled We got a fair hearing The judge listened well while both sides presented their arguments and was clearly knowledgeable McCollough said He read the brief He read all the cases and all the rules we cited and so no matter how it turns out all I can say is the guy did his homework and we got a fair hearing Mitchell M Tsai attorney for the plaintiffs said in a press conference after the hearing that he was cautiously optimistic McCollough agreed The judge s statements and questions suggested he seems inclined to rule that most of the state law issues we are raising are not preempted by federal law McCollough said Fiber First LA member Julie Levine who attended the hearing said the judge pointed out that the county has the ability and the responsibility to have protective ordinances within what is allowable by the Federal Communications Commission FCC In fact Levine told The Defender the FCC encourages local municipalities to have their own ordinances to guide things like placement of these wireless towers This undermines Los Angeles County s claim Oh we can t do anything because the federal government prohibits it she said McCollough cautioned that judges sometimes play devil s advocate during hearings to test their own theory on a matter making it impossible to predict how the judge will rule Wireless issue is gaining traction People attending the rally carried signs bearing slogans including Board of

District of Columbia against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC to obtain documents related to the agency s safety monitoring of the COVID 19 vaccines through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS database The lawsuit alleges the CDC violated provisions of the Freedom of Information Act FOIA by failing to respond to CHD s FOIA requests to provide key analysis of reports

considers VAERS to be a key early warning system for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that can signal safety problems with a vaccine According to the co sponsored VAERS Standard Operating Procedures SOP for COVID 19 dated Jan 29 2021 the CDC and the FDA would coordinate monitoring for potential new safety concerns for COVID 19 vaccines by performing routine VAERS surveillance Each agency would use a different standard approach to data mining to screen for potential safety signals The CDC would run proportional reporting ratio PRR data mining on a weekly basis or as needed PRR would compare the reports of specific adverse events suffered after receiving a Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine to reports made after receiving any other vaccine to see if there

event was caused by the vaccine and that data would be shared with the public Both agencies failed to make data public Last month CHD filed a federal lawsuit against the FDA to obtain documents related to its empirical Bayesian data mining The Defender Reported In today s case CHD made two requests The first request sought the records of all PRR conducted by the CDC related to COVID 19 from Oct 1 2021 to the present along with all communications within the CDC and with the FDA about the PRR results and follow up investigations required by the SOP done in connection with those results The second request sought the daily email alerts from VAERS contractors hired by the CDC listing identification numbers for all adverse events of special interest which are events requiring further investigation CDC s conflicting statements about its VAERS monitoring Since last year the CDC has issued a series of conflicting statements to The Epoch Times and CHD regarding their ongoing monitoring of the VAERS database In June 2022 the CDC told CHD that no PRRs were conducted by the CDC and that data mining was outside of the agency s purview This was despite the fact that the SOP document dated Jan 29 2021 stipulated the CDC and FDA would begin ongoing data mining analysis then Next in July 2021 the CDC told The Epoch Times that it had in fact been performing PRRs since January 2021 and was continuing to do so Two months later the CDC changed its story again This time it told The Epoch Times that it performed PRR analysis for a four month period from March 25 2022 to July 31 2022 March 25 2022 was three days after CHD emailed the CDC reminding them of their pending FOIA requesting the PRR analysis At that time the CDC also said that its PRR results were generally

that the CDC provided it with some of the PRR analysis it conducted between March and July 2022 The CDC shared an overall PRR analysis of all events reported from Dec 14 2020 to July 29 2022 But it only shared its weekly analysis from three weeks the weeks of July 15 22 and 29 2022 It is unclear whether the CDC did analysis during other weeks or whether it never did the ongoing analysis mandated by the SOP That analysis revealed hundreds of safety signals including signals for serious conditions such as blood clotting in the lungs intermenstrual bleeding lack of oxygen to the heart and even death The CDC admitted it gave false information about COVID 19 vaccine surveillance including inaccurately saying it had conducted a certain type of analysis more than a year before it actually did Yet given its conflicting statements what surveillance analysis the CDC actually did and when it did it remains unclear Access to this information would reveal when the CDC knew about safety signals related to the COVID 19 vaccine CHD s FOIA request seeks all of these documents in order to clarify this timeline CDC anticipated spike in VAERS reports with COVID vaccine Despite the fact that health officials and scientific journals have downplayed or dismissed the importance of VAERS during the pandemic the CDC states in the SOP that it is a key front line system to monitor the safety of vaccines licensed for use in the United States Information revealed through FOIA requests demonstrates that the CDC was anticipating a spike in VAERS reporting when the new vaccines were released and spent millions of dollars hiring contractors to process the data Communication with these contractors is part of CHD s FOIA lawsuit A FOIA request revealed in late August 2020 that the CDC contracted

claiming attorney client privilege or whether the FDA had even searched for the records The FDA indicated that a response to those concerns would take 9 to 12 months In a separate but related FOIA

Without Parents Knowledge or Consent Children s Health Defense and Parental Rights Foundation sued the District of Columbia mayor health department and school system seeking a court order to declare the D C Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020 unconstitutional You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Children s Health Defense CHD and Parental Rights Foundation on Monday filed a lawsuit in the U S District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a court order to declare the D C Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020 D C Act unconstitutional Plaintiffs in the suit are four parents of minor children who attend public school in the District of Columbia They seek a preliminary injunction to prohibit the mayor the D C Department of Health and the D C Public School System from enforcing the D C Act The D C Act allows children 11 years old and older to consent to the administration of any vaccine including COVID shots recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP without parental knowledge or consent if the medical provider believes the minor is capable of meeting the informed consent standard The D C Act contains several provisions designed to deceive parents and hide the fact that a child has been vaccinated against parental judgment authority or religious convictions For example the D C Act mandates based on documents filed by parents if a minor has a religious exemption from vaccines or has opted out of the HPV vaccine the healthcare provider should leave those parts of the student s immunization record blank Sec 3 b 2 The D C Act also requires healthcare personnel provide accurate immunization records to the Department of Health and to the student s school but not to parents It also contains subsections authorizing healthcare personnel to seek reimbursement without parental consent directly from the insurer noting that insurers shall not send an Explanation of Benefits for services provided The healthcare providers who vaccinate children against parental directives will be paid by the parents health insurance company with no documentation of paid for services provided to parents This law now permits an 11 year old to override his or her parents express written directive and requires the child s school to falsify and withhold vaccine records from the parents

vaccinated at school they may not recognize vaccine adverse reactions Serious adverse reactions require immediate medical treatment and are contraindications to further vaccination Also if the family doctor is unaware the child was vaccinated at school additional vaccines may be administered too close in time to those given at school Vaccine manufacturers the American Academy of Pediatrics and government public health authorities publish strict warnings about the timing of vaccines Children are typically unaware of their family medical history and any inherent contraindications to vaccines Holland explained The D C Act is reckless unconstitutional and needlessly endangers children s lives by stripping away parental protection and the protection of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 Holland said Congress enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 Vaccine Act in response to a growing number of lawsuits alleging neurological and other damage from vaccine injuries The Vaccine Act and the subsequent Supreme Court decision Bruesewitz v Wyeth shield vaccine manufacturers from virtually all liability on the premise that vaccine injury is unavoidable It requires those injured seek compensation from a fatally flawed government compensation program Holland said Federal court decisions have acknowledged some children will suffer adverse events including brain damage seizures paralysis and death from childhood vaccines The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid more than 4 5 billion to date in compensation to families of those injured and killed by vaccines To minimize the number of injuries and to compensate those seriously injured the Vaccine Act requires parents be provided with Vaccine Information Statements vaccine records and directions for reporting vaccine adverse events to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS Federally mandated Vaccine Injury Statements are designed to provide parents with the minimum amount of information necessary to meet informed consent requirements These statements provide critical information regarding how to recognize vaccine adverse events including allergic reactions anaphylaxis seizures and paralysis and explain that some children should not be vaccinated The D C Act completely disregards federal laws to protect children including the requirements to provide Vaccine Injury Statements recording requirements and mandatory reporting of vaccine adverse events according to Holland The Defender has covered the progression of the D C City Council bill

facilities on private property in the unincorporated areas of L A County and associated provisions According to Fiber First Los Angeles County Fiber First LA a nonprofit that promotes fiber optic networks over wireless infrastructures the amendments strip residents of the right to have a voice in how wireless technology is deployed in their own neighborhoods by removing public notice setbacks oversight safety and environmental review and any opportunities for appeal The ordinances also stipulate that small cell projects may not have to comply with California environmental law Fiber First

acknowledging they were on Tongva land and yet they completely disregarded a written plea from the Keetoowah people to reverse the categorical exemption from the state environmental law the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and oppose titles 16 and 22 Martinez said She added They awarded and recognized the life long social fights and environmental victories of the prominent L A pastor Monsignor John Morreta among marginalized communities yet disregarded his written plea in opposition to the ordinances They ignored Fiber First LA s written request to make real meaningful changes on titles 16 and 22 The ordinances could result in thousands of wireless transmitters popping up across unincorporated areas of L A County in the next few years Public News Service reported Verizon

revisions we ask that you remove the letter from the public record and ignore its fraudulent contents Nonetheless the board members chose to approve the amendments allowing for streamlining of wireless rollout and effectively ignoring the evidence of fraudulent manipulation of public opinion by Verizon Fiber First LA noted Recent changes nothing more than window dressing The originally scheduled Dec 6 2022 vote was delayed because the board said unanswered questions remained that couldn t be addressed in time to meet the deadline for public comments L A County staff recommended some last minute changes to the proposed amendments that likely facilitated their passing on Tuesday McCollough told The Defender The actual wording is not yet available but based on two supervisors descriptions they appear topical and will not materially solve any of the significant policy and legal issues we raised McCollough said Fiber First LA also emphasized that the last minute changes did not meaningfully address the concerns raised by the Board of Supervisors or those we have brought to the board s attention In a letter to the board Susan Foster co founder of the nonprofit California Fires Firefighters and a member of Fiber First LA who attended Tuesday s meeting said that the proposed changes were nothing more than window dressing Foster who spoke during the public comment

to that of the FCC L A County staff recommended that wireless related provisions through amendments to titles 16 and 22 should be exempt from any environmental or historical evaluation based on a purported categorical exemption Additionally Fiber First LA warned the board there likely would be massive and irreversible adverse environmental consequences if the cell tower projects allowed via the changes to titles 16 and 22 were granted categorical exemption from CEQA It is truly disturbing that CEQA is not considered necessary by the L A Board and logic tells you that when installing hundreds or potentially thousands of small cells there is a footprint that needs to be considered First Fiber LA co chair Jodi Nelson told The Defender Logic also tells you that at least a small percentage of this infrastructure will have environmental impacts just based on their footprint not even considering emissions and that some of this equipment will potentially be sitting on ecologically vulnerable sites said Nelson who accused the county of allowing telecom to dictate environmental policy The UKB said their 2019 lawsuit victory shows that categorical exemption already has a precedent of not holding up in court The UKB pointed out that the 2019 federal ruling stated tribes views must be taken into account where the agreement has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe The 2019 legal battle came about when FCC officials claimed they could deploy thousands of wireless antennae for 5G capabilities without meeting tribal consultation requirements by arguing the projects were not defined as undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act or major federal actions under NEPA However the U S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after hearing oral arguments from the UKB and 20 other joining tribes ruled that the FCC must uphold tribal consultation requirements for small 5G cell tower deployments In August 2021 the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the FCC and in favor of CHD and called for the FCC to reevaluate its wireless radiation exposure standards because it had failed to consider the non cancer evidence regarding adverse health effects of wireless technology In the 2019 UKB case the court found the FCC s

for documents related to LA s smart city initiatives According to the complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court key departments in city government violated the California Public Records Act CPRA by failing to promptly respond to CHD s request to produce electronic records from 2019 2023 for communications programs committees and technologies related to smart city planning Most of the city s 20 departments involved in smart city planning provided the documents CHD requested in April But the Information Technology Agency Bureau of Street Lighting LA World Airports Bureau of Street Services Bureau of Engineering and the LA Police Department which likely have the most sensitive information regarding the smart city rollout have not produced the requested documents CHD alleges those departments violated the legal time guidelines for responding to the records requests What the City of Los Angeles wants to do is build a full scale smart city and all of this is laid out in the strategy documents attorney Gregory Glaser who filed the complaint told The Defender But very little information about how the city is implementing that strategy is being shared publicly Glaser said CHD along with two LA residents concerned about how the smart city technologies may be violating their rights and those of their children are seeking documents detailing the city s current projects

create a highly digital and connected city by 2028 2028 is set as the target year because LA will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and plans to provide tourists with a digital Olympic experience according to the SmartLA 2028 strategy document The document outlines in broad strokes a vision for the city that Olympics consumers will visit a smart city built for LA to compete in the digital economy The plan includes a panoply of digital infrastructure including a surveillance camera network that can capture individual face and voice signatures and can be used for law enforcement or could be marketed to third parties It also includes technologies like Amazon Sidewalk which connects private wireless signals digital payment platforms for city services the use of AI for city contracting and more LA s use of the Olympics as justification for expanding digital surveillance powers is part of a global trend Local and national security officials over the past several decades have used the

Health Defense CHD and several parents today filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging a Philadelphia law that allows minors to consent to vaccination without their parents knowledge saying the legislation violates the constitutionally protected doctrine of informed consent and fundamental parental rights The lawsuit alleges the City of Philadelphia engaged in a wink and a nod practice of vaccinating children behind parents backs without informed consent for the past 15 years under the cover of the 2007 General Minor Consent Regulation That rule allows children 11 and older to consent to vaccination without parental knowledge as long as they receive a vaccine information statement VIS for the administered shot It also absolves the vaccine administrator of liability if the minor gives consent On May 14 2021 the city s Department of Public Health also enacted an additional COVID 19 Minor Consent Regulation allowing children ages 11 and up to consent to the COVID 19 vaccine available under Emergency Use Authorization Under that regulation children could give consent if they received the U S Food and Drug Administration fact sheet because a COVID 19 VIS did not exist at the time Tricia Lindsay attorney for the plaintiffs told The Defender the fundamental rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children are at stake in the case The only time that a parent loses rights to their children is by a strict showing that they are not capable of taking care of their child But here the government of Philadelphia is issuing a blanket statement and taking away parental rights without due process and that is one of the greatest violations ever They are using emergency powers and the excuse of concerns over health and safety to justify it But it s camouflage It s a Trojan horse They are using these buzzwords to justify their tyranny which is what you call it when you remove a person s fundamental rights without due process Seven Pennsylvania parents

United States Constitution and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and other federal and Commonwealth laws The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare Philadelphia s 2007 and 2021 Minor Consent Regulations illegal and to stop them from being enforced CHD President Mary Holland told The Defender It s absurd to imagine that it is safe or desirable for 11 year olds to make potentially life altering medical decisions on their own without parental guidance knowledge or consent Philadelphia s so called consent policies violate state federal and constitutional laws I am happy that CHD is able to help put an end to these policies that actually endanger children s health National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and VISs Plaintiffs allege that Philadelphia s regulations conflict with the consent requirements of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 NCVIA the federal law that has primacy over conflicting local laws on such matters according to the U S Constitution They also argue that the complicated requirements for seeking compensation if someone is injured by a vaccine protected by the NCVIA would be incomprehensible to most if not all children Under the NCVIA vaccine manufacturers are protected from liability for a vaccine s adverse effects if the vaccines are listed on its Vaccine Injury Table The table lists covered vaccines their recognized injuries and the timeframes within which those injuries must occur to be considered compensable Liability for injuries caused by vaccines listed on the table cannot be pursued in a regular court of law but are instead compensated through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP The VICP also can provide compensation for an injury by a covered vaccine even if the injury isn t listed as compensable on the Vaccine Injury Table However the legal and administrative process is more complicated Even for listed injuries it can be difficult to obtain compensation from the VICP The backlog of cases is substantial and the proceedings are often drawn out by contentious expert battles The NCVIA mandates that the secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services

t know what to look out for and they don t know if the problem they are seeing is related to a vaccine The NCVIA specifically mandated that VISs must be presented in a jargon free and straightforward way that parents can understand The NCVIA doesn t mention making them comprehensible to children because the drafters of the NCVIA never imagined children would have to understand them on their own the complaint alleges The NCVIA simply does not contemplate that a child may be vaccinated without parental consent the complaint states Quite the opposite the language of the NCVIA is clear that the VIS is provided to the parent who is able to offer informed consent on behalf of his or her child But this law the lawsuit alleges removes parents from the equation altogether What about COVID vaccine injuries The COVID 19 vaccines are not covered by the NCVIA or the VICP Instead under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP Act people injured by a COVID 19 vaccine or countermeasure can seek compensation only under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program CICP Since 2010 when the CICP approved its first claim the program has compensated a total of 36 claims for vaccine injuries six of those awards were for COVID 19 vaccine related injuries The complaint also noted that COVID 19 vaccines available for 11 year olds are still investigational Children are not capable of understanding the risks associated with a novel vaccine and cannot appreciate that there are no long term studies of the safety or effectiveness of these vaccines the complaint states Lindsay said it

register for the selective services without parental consent One must be 16 to donate blood and 14 to consent to mental health treatment It is also illegal the complaint notes for pharmacists to administer vaccines to children 5 and older without parental consent According to the complaint Philadelphia s Minor Consent Regulations turn these requirements on their head Rather than protecting children Philadelphia s Minor Consent Regulations let any child walk into a temporary vaccine pop up clinic or elsewhere on a whim roll up her sleeve and receive a vaccine without her parents knowledge and even more importantly her parents protective veil of consent The Minor Consent Regulations are a house of cards built on the unsupported unsupportable and preposterous presumption that

lawsuits and struggles When the pandemic began most states had existing laws mandating parental consent for vaccination with a few limited exceptions But once the vaccines became available some states and localities attempted to lower the age at which children could consent to vaccination on their own During Tennessee s COVID 19 vaccination campaign the state s Department of Health invoked the mature minor doctrine to allow minors 14 and older to be vaccinated without a parent s consent But in response to grassroots mobilization and testimony by CHD Tennessee lawmakers in April passed a law requiring healthcare providers to obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian before vaccinating a minor In March 2022 CHD prevailed in a lawsuit against Washington D C Mayor Muriel Bowser the D C Department of Health D C Health and D C public schools after the U S District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting the schools from enforcing the D C Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020 a law that would have allowed children as young as 11 to be vaccinated without the knowledge or consent of their parents In that lawsuit the D C District Court ruled in favor of CHD s argument that the NCVIA pre empted D C s law that attempted to lower the age of consent for vaccinations to 11 and prevented the mayor of the District of Columbia the D C Department of Health and D C public schools from enforcing the law The court in that case commented specifically on the intended function of the VIS If Congress did not mean for the legal representative of a child to receive a VIS when his child receives a vaccine then the phrase the legal representatives of any child would be superfluous All Congress would have

friend request After all Meta s founder Mark Zuckerberg is a political lightning rod in conservative political circles especially after the 300 million worth of Zuckerbucks spent during the 2020 election to elect like minded politicians Yet lately Zuckerberg has been singing a much different tune He referred to President elect Donald Trump as badass visited him at Mar a Lago and donated 1 million to his inaugural fund This week Meta made news by adding Dana White a longtime Trump ally and head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship or UFC to its board of directors Then came the real bombshell Meta ended its so called independent fact checking program ostensibly lifting restrictions on speech across Facebook as well as their other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp In doing so Zuckerberg admitted the current content moderation practices in place since criticism of his platform during the 2016 presidential election have gone too far and stressed a commitment to restoring free expression Make no mistake Meta s independent fact checkers are neither independent nor fact based Their elimination is a positive step and should be encouraged The announcement came less than 24 hours after the organization I lead the nonprofit Children s Health Defense CHD asked the U S Supreme Court to hear our censorship lawsuit against Meta But if Meta is serious about supporting free expression they have a lot of work to do and it requires more than moving workers from California to Texas as Zuckerberg also pledged to do During the COVID 19 pandemic Meta not only censored our posts many having to do with topics that the so called medical experts like Dr Anthony Fauci were dead wrong about but outright kicked us off the platform without warning Meta first took action

Meta shut down the free expression they claim to be championing Yes Meta was coerced by the Biden administration but there s more to the story Zuckerberg s WhatsApp messages showed that he conspired with the government and chose to censor because he had bigger fish to fry than protecting free speech He knew then that censorship violated the rights of free expression and he knew then that it wouldn t help the administration bring COVID 19 under control but he did it anyway The pandemic may be over but speech about COVID 19 is not If the Supreme Court takes our case it can guarantee accountability for Meta s role in this man made disaster and prevent another in the future Meta like the other mega platforms must be held accountable when they knowingly conform their content

sued the National Institutes of Health NIH for failing to respond to CHD s Freedom of Information Act FOIA request for documents related to correspondence between NIH researchers and individuals who

the FOIA request Nov 10 2022 The NIH has not produced the documents or a final determination and stopped responding to CHD CHD alleges the NIH violated the legal time limits for responding to FOIA requests and is withholding crucial information from the public Lawsuits like this are critically important said Kim Mack Rosenberg CHD acting general counsel Government transparency concerning its research on injuries following COVID 19 injections is of paramount importance Rosenberg added The U S government has encouraged and in some cases mandated these injections How can it now turn a blind eye to requests for information concerning injuries Individuals have a right to this information to promote informed decision making By ignoring CHD s FOIA request NIH only further undermines the public s trust in NIH and other government agencies Several vaccine injury victims who communicated with the NIH spoke to The Defender about their experiences interacting with the NIH and participating in a study it was conducting on vaccine injured individuals although the NIH has since on several occasions denied having data on such individuals or even conducting such research No NIH response after six months despite repeated requests According to the lawsuit in early 2021 NIH researchers began to hear from individuals who were experiencing severe lasting health problems after COVID 19 injection including neurological cardiovascular muscular and other disorders At that time the lawsuit states The NIH researchers sought to learn more even bringing some affected people to NIH headquarters for testing and sometimes treatment Those efforts resulted in at least one publicly available paper Neuropathic symptoms with SARS CoV 2 vaccination That study which examined 23 patients who reported new neuropathic symptoms within a month of their COVID 19 vaccination suggests that a variety of neuropathic symptoms may manifest after SARS CoV 2 vaccinations and in some patients might

19 injection CHD asked for all emails sent and received from vaccine injured individuals all NIH call logs documenting communications with these individuals and all internal communications between NIH researchers regarding any affected individuals The FOIA request was filed on an expedited basis because CHD said In light of ongoing pressure to accept COVID 19 injections and ongoing medical and policy debates connected with the shots the public has an urgent need to understand how the federal government is addressing adverse events through the NIH s behind the scenes engagement with vaccine injured individuals CHD argued that a lack of transparency about this engagement deprives people of the information needed to make fully informed medical and political decisions and erodes confidence in the conclusions reached and guidance promulgated by federal agencies The NIH acknowledged receipt of the FOIA request on Nov 18 2022 assigning it a reference number but denied the expedited review claiming a lack of compelling need and arguing that CHD s request was overbroad CHD was given an opportunity to clarify its request and to provide additional information The NIH did not respond to several attempts by CHD to obtain clarification about the additional information the NIH required On Dec 15 2022 CHD formally submitted a clarified request to NIH narrowing down its request to a series of search terms including vaccin adverse neurol autoimmune clot suici vertigo heart paresthesia and lymph In response the NIH asked CHD to specify which NIH office and personnel you would like searched as there are 27 institutes and centers IC at the NIH and over 18 000 employees and searching all of them places undue burden on federal government resources and deems your request Improper

According to Dressen the NIH was initially responsive and communicative with her It was interesting at the beginning there was no reason to suspect something nefarious was going on They went so far as to try to work with my home physicians to get my home physicians to take care of me properly And so they believed me and they believed the other injured person from the study It wasn t a question of if we were injured It was We were injured according to the NIH we were injured by the COVID vaccine So they promised us that they were going to collect the data on the study they were doing into neurological complications to the COVID vaccines They promised us repeatedly that they would be informing the scientific community and that then everybody else could get care According to Dressen it was this apparent early interest that led her and other vaccine injured individuals to participate in the NIH study That s why we participated in this study Dressen said Because if the NIH says that there are albeit rare neurological complications to a pharmaceutical product then the medical community and the scientific community are going to take that seriously However she said What we got instead was a little bit of a bait and switch where they were interacting with us regularly They were evaluating our labs even at home after we had been there for research And then they slowly grew distant from us and then completely cut off all communication Dressen said her communication with the NIH lasted between January and September 2021 when NIH stopped responding and canceled a scheduled appointment with her They had scheduled a follow up time for me to come out and be evaluated so they could collect more data And that was supposed to be in September 2021 but they abruptly canceled

symptoms of anaphylaxis Hertz said she initially received remote treatment from NIH physicians and was participant No 2 in their study of vaccine injured individuals Between February and July 2021 she had frequent correspondence with the NIH totaling 40 pages of emails which she shared with The Defender For instance a Feb 11 2021 email to Hertz from Dr Alkis Togias branch chief of Allergy Asthma and Airway Biology at the NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID stated problems like yours have been reported by other people so the various agencies and the companies know about them Dr Anthony Fauci was director of NIAID before stepping down at the end of 2022 A March 17 2021 email to Hertz from Farinaz Safavi M D Ph D of the NIH s Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology stated We started this effort and trying our best to gather information from patients with vaccine side effects to thoughtfully organize the information and report them Safavi added If you look at VAERS Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database there are more than 1000 neurological side effects already reported but in order to present it to scientific community we have to gather as much information as we can before sending it out I promise you we will report your issue and other cases that we are reviewing now and I really appreciate if you kindly give us 1 2 weeks to

behalf of Children s Health Defense CHD today filed a motion to intervene in the legal battle between the Pittsfield Massachusetts Board of Health and Verizon over the telecom giant s refusal to remove or relocate a cell tower The motion filed on behalf of six Pittsfield residents is related to a lawsuit filed earlier this month by a Verizon Wireless affiliated cellular provider seeking to invalidate the Board of Health s April 11 order to remove the tower The board on Feb 2 voted unanimously to issue a cease and desist order to Verizon if the company refused to discuss removing or relocating the tower which residents said is the source of multiple illnesses Verizon affiliate Pittsfield Celluar Telephone responded by suing to overturn the board s order Lawyers on behalf of CHD have been advising Pittsfield residents for several months while the matter was before the board and are now filing in the court case to defend the board order Specifically lawyers representing the residents will oppose Verizon s request that the court rule the Telecommunications Act of 1996 expressly preempts the board s emergency order Verizon Wireless is also arguing the emergency order was improperly issued is null and void and has no legal effect The board went through an exhaustive analysis of the science and medical information in the record it compiled including testimony from renowned independent scientists and medical doctors individual diagnoses of the affected residents plus testimony by the residents themselves The board order found convincing evidence that pulsed and modulated radiofrequency radiation RFR is bio active and affects all living things over the long term RFR can and does also cause more immediate harm and injury to human beings The order also noted the cell tower rendered the historic Shacktown section of Pittsfield u nfit for human habitation because the continued exposure causes them severe pain unable to function and endangers and materially impairs their health and safety this evidence clearly demonstrates to this Board that specific Shacktown residents in the vicinity of the facility have suffered and are suffering injuries and illnesses directly caused by the pulsed and modulated RFR emitted by the facility in issue and for so long as the facility is in operation it will continue to be injurious to the public health and continue to drive residents from their homes The Verizon Wireless 877 South Street wireless facility", "chunk_id":

wireless facility operated by Verizon Wireless is a public nuisance a cause of sickness and a trade which may result in a nuisance or be dangerous to the public health Commenting on the case Mary Holland CHD president and general counsel said CHD is committed to protecting children from all kinds of toxins and wireless emissions are just that CHD has been exposing the risks and harms associated with the heedless stampede toward powerful wireless base stations everywhere and anywhere The Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit in August 2021 agreed handing CHD a win over the Federal Communications Commission FCC in EHT et al v Federal Communications Commission ruling the FCC s decision to retain its 26 year old RFR regulatory guidelines were for the most part arbitrary and capricious The situation in Pittsfield now confirms our arguments to the FCC and the court that the FCC s current emission limits are obsolete Holland said She added The science is clear Electromagnetic and Radiofrequency radiation EMF RF emitted from cell towers is destroying the environment putting our children s future at risk and now as the expert Pittsfield Board of Health specifically found this tower is already making a cluster of at least 17 residents severely ill CHD is representing four of the affected families Holland said in an effort to ensure the cellular company is held to account for the injuries it has caused These families must be allowed to return to their homes and live in an environment that is not filled with electrosmog said Holland We will explain to the court that the board s order is lawful and is not preempted by federal law Stating that this matter should not be in court at all much less federal court Holland said the attorneys will

in a Catch 22 petitioners are lawfully permitted to follow the Attorney General s guidance to opt out of corporate surveillance but cannot identify the surveillance in order to opt out CHD said in its

taking place by the City and the City s corporate partners like Amazon and Oracle California and federal law both protect the right to know what personal information is collected along with the right to opt in and opt out of information sharing and sale according to the brief In its Digital Code of Ethics the City of Los Angeles recognizes residents right to navigate the city without digital ID and without having locational and other data tracked and stored However publicly available information and the records obtained by CHD so far indicate the city does collect and store such data in

The city acknowledges there is a significant public interest in understanding how City intends to implement the roll out of its smart technology strategy as its implementation will impact public safety transportation energy and other community infrastructure The city didn t deny the issues raised about privacy rights and the right to opt out of surveillance Instead it said those issues were perhaps worthy of investigation in some other lawsuit but said it was outside of the scope of this particular request which the city argued is more narrowly about the city s compliance with the California Public Records Act To that end the city said it had produced tens of thousands of responsive records and withheld only a small fraction of them and argued the different forms of privilege it claimed to withhold the documents was justified Because the court found almost entirely for the plaintiffs Glaser said city officials will need to produce thousands of more documents over the next

people to install wireless transmitting antennas on their homes without notifying neighboring property owners The new rule would preempt state and local zoning laws homeowner association rules and

adoption of a rule that would allow people to install wireless transmitting antennas on their homes without notifying neighboring properties The suit was filed in the U S Court of Appeals in the DC Circuit At issue is an amendment to the Over the Air Reception Devices rule OTARD that would deprive people of the opportunity to object to the installation of wireless transmitting antennas on neighboring homes The rule set to take effect March 29 would facilitate the fast deployment of 5G and 1 000 000 SpaceX Satellite antennas and create super Wi Fi mesh networks in urban and rural areas CHD s lawsuit filed under the Administrative Procedure Act asserts that the FCC s amended OTARD rule violates constitutional rights and upends long standing common law personal and property rights The suit alleges that the amended rule leads to due process violations is arbitrary represents an abuse of discretion and was passed without authority and statutory jurisdiction OTARD allows private property owners to place fixed point to point antennas supporting wireless service on their property and for the first time to provide wireless data voice services including 5G to users on neighboring properties by connecting a hub or relay designed to transmit the signal onto neighboring properties The only limitation imposed on property owners is the size of the antenna Under the amended rule the diameter of the antenna should not exceed 1 meter approximately 3 feet The amended rule will not directly allow placement of personal wireless service e g traditional mobile service antennas although it can effectively achieve the same outcome Scott McCollough an attorney representing CHD in the case said that while this distinction is important it does not mean that the rule change will have insignificant effects To the contrary the fixed wireless can be used to support private mobile service 3G 4G 5G and it will allow for significant expansion of wireless services OTARD eliminates all state and local zoning authority over these antennas No permit is required No notice to neighboring properties owners is required And homeowners association and deed restrictions and any other state

their municipalities to adopt ordinances that will keep antennas away from their homes residential neighborhoods and schools OTARD will severely undermine the effectiveness of these efforts Dafna Tachover director of CHD s 5G and Wireless Harms Project said This rule will create a wireless wild west Because of the extensive preemptions and how easy OTARD makes it to install antennas to propagate the signals the rule will likely lead to the most significant and fastest proliferation of 5G by using homes and private properties for the deployment The new rule also preempts federal and state civil rights laws that protect the disabled Sickness from wireless is widespread Those who have already been injured by wireless devices and infrastructure such as Wi Fi and cell towers will not be entitled to accommodation which could force some families out of their homes in order to protect themselves Under OTARD even rural areas will no longer be safe CHD s petition was joined by four individual petitioners including a physician and parents of five children who have been injured by wireless radiation This rule is an unprecedented and intolerable attack on our rights and constitutional protections Tachover said From the moment we became aware that the FCC intended to adopt this rule it was clear to us that allowing it to go into effect without a challenge was not an option CHD started its campaign against OTARD and laid the ground for a lawsuit in April 2020 when the organization filed a 22 page letter with the FCC The letter was joined by a record number of 15 090 people Of those 6 231 people declared that they and or their children have become injured by wireless radiation More than 2 500 people added personal comments many of them substantive with heartbreaking testimonials of sickness and death caused by wireless radiation Parents wrote about their children s sickness with cancer radiation sickness and the aggravating effects wireless has on the autism symptoms of their children and on seizures They said they fear the devastating effects the adoption of OTARD will have on their lives Still despite these widespread objections from

Rutgers University its board of governors Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and others over the university s decision to mandate COVID vaccines for students attending school in the fall According to the complaint the Rutgers vaccine requirement is an affront to human dignity and personal freedom because it violates our basic right to control our bodies The lawsuit states that in a free society

coercion by anyone and to be fully informed of the benefits and especially the risks of that decision The lawsuit alleges Rutgers policy is a violation of the right to informed consent and the right to refuse unwanted medical treatments The complaint also alleges the policy is a breach of contract because in January 2021 the university assured students COVID vaccines would not be required in order to attend school Just two months later Rutgers flip flopped and issued new requirements for taking the shot prior to attending classes According to the plaintiffs Rutgers is working with all three manufacturers Pfizer Moderna and Johnson Johnson to study and develop their vaccines in on going clinical trials and will benefit financially if more people are required to take the shots which until fully licensed by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA are defined by the FDA as experimental The Rutgers requirement also constitutes a denial of equal protection as administration faculty and staff are not required to take the vaccine It also conflicts with federal and state law as neither has enacted legislation requiring COVID vaccines for citizens This mandate undermines our

to radically empower courts and federal agencies to displace state law and to ignore Congress s intent in doing so Moreover the 9th Circuit s decision contradicts other courts decisions the plaintiffs said For instance the 4th Circuit ruled in 2005 that the FCC s guidelines set only a regulatory floor not a ceiling meaning that state law health and safety claims did not conflict with the regulation s purposes or objectives at all the plaintiffs wrote Wireless companies want to be free of potential or actual liability In its brief CHD supported the plaintiffs argument pointing out the FCC has expressly refused to preempt state law over consumer devices on several occasions when members of the telecommunications industry asked the FCC to step in and eliminate people s rights A rule making administration process exists for the purpose of establishing such preemption and the FCC has chosen not to complete that process regarding its personal electronic devices policy CHD said According to McCollough a former Texas assistant attorney general and telecom and administrative law attorney the real issue is that Apple and by extension all other wireless device equipment manufactures and vendors whether cellphones or things like Wi Fi routers want to be completely free of potential or actual liability for the damage they cause to people and the environment McCollough said They contend that the mere act of registering the equipment with the FCC immunizes them from state law remedies for physical or other injuries resulting from the RF EMR exposure or even things like fires started by the internal battery even though the FCC has repeatedly refused to preempt state law judicial remedies and there is no alternative forum that provides recompense Apple has until April 14 2023 to

Mask Plaintiffs Jane and Sarah Doe allege Sarah s New York school violated her constitutional rights by denying her a mask exemption despite repeated requests by Sarah s mother and pediatrician You

S Supreme Court to hear their case after a lower court partially dismissed it in April Plaintiffs Jane and Sarah Doe allege the Franklin Square Union Free School District in Long Island New York violated Sarah s constitutional rights by wrongfully denying her a mask exemption The school denied repeated requests by Sarah s mother and pediatrician for a medical exemption despite evidence the mandate severely harmed Sarah the petition alleges Jane and Sarah sued the school district in September 2021 and filed an amended complaint in January 2022 A district court dismissed the complaint in March 2023 On April 25 2024 the 2nd Circuit U S Court of Appeals reversed part of that dismissal allowing the lower court to consider allegations that the school violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 However the 2nd Circuit upheld the district court s decision to dismiss the constitutional claims The disability claims are proceeding through the lower courts Meanwhile the plaintiffs are asking the Supreme Court to weigh in on the immense nationwide significance of the constitutional issues The petition asks Is there a fundamental right to medical exemption from public health mandates that may place a child at serious risk of harm Alternatively can the government deny medical exemption requests compelling vulnerable children to undergo medical interventions against medical advice without the obligation to demonstrate that such denials serve a compelling state interest The plaintiffs are represented by Sujata Gibson who also represented teachers and healthcare workers fired for refusing to take the COVID 19 vaccine and by attorneys Mary Holland who is also CEO of Children s Health Defense CHD and Kim Mack Rosenberg CHD general counsel Gibson told The Defender that it became evident during the COVID 19 pandemic that some states empowered themselves to reject medical exemptions to vaccines or masks or any kind of politicized intervention without any real scientific basis for doing so As a result she said Children have become very vulnerable to the whims of unqualified school administrators who

countless children will endure the long term consequences of this lack of accountability School employees mocked her punished her and even filmed her petition alleges Sarah has several health issues including asthma and anxiety which make her unable to tolerate prolonged mask use according to the petition When the New York State Department of Health in fall 2020 began instituting various temporary mask mandates in schools they provided exemptions for students who couldn t medically tolerate them Sarah s mother made several attempts with the support of Sarah s lifelong pediatrician to secure an exemption for Sarah However the school district denied all of them claiming they had a no accommodation policy according to the petition The district refused to allow Sarah to participate in virtual learning When her family threatened a lawsuit the district had its own doctor who never examined Sarah confirm that she did not need an exemption Sarah s mother submitted an affidavit to a lower court detailing the severity of Sarah s deteriorating health When the court indicated it might impose an injunction on the exception refusal the school district agreed to allow her to wear a mesh mask as a temporary accommodation The mesh mask provided some relief but it caused Sarah to suffer fungal infections She continued to experience difficulty breathing and panic attacks when wearing it Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us No public health agency has said that mesh masks offer protection against COVID 19 Although the School District acknowledged that the mesh mask provided no protective benefit essentially serving only as a costume it refused to allow Sarah to stop wearing it when it became clear that the mesh mask was insufficient according to

was a 1905 smallpox vaccine case in which the court found a state may require all residents to take a vaccine if a rational basis exists to determine that such a step is necessary to mitigate a public health emergency According to Gibson courts have misinterpreted Jacobson to mean the courts aren t obligated to scrutinize whether fundamental rights are violated when public health is at stake The Supreme Court itself said in a concurring opinion written ins 2020 by Justice Neil McGill Gorsuch that some courts have mistaken this Court s modest decision in Jacobson for a towering authority that

is legitimate for a state to mandate an experimental medical product that cannot stop the spread of disease as many states did during the COVID 19 pandemic According to the petition it is illegal to mandate any product including masks under emergency use authorization Gibson said the government can t show a rational basis for mandating an experimental medical product Under the rational basis argument the government has to show it has a legitimate basis for infringing on rights However Gibson said imposing an unwanted experimental treatment on someone is not only a constitutional violation

has been charged with moral turpitude for stating back in the summer of 2021 that the COVID vaccines will only provide a temporary benefit and will neither prevent infection nor transmission which is a position public health authorities and the media strongly at the time criticized as COVID misinformation Because of the ongoing nationwide campaign against physicians voicing dissenting opinions and

or maybe straight up bribes but either way he said the vaccines should have never been approved Kennedy and Dowd discussed how the trial numbers were skewed to make it seem the vaccines were effective when the real data showed otherwise Kennedy said What it really means is you have to give 22 000 vaccines to prevent one COVID death And if you re gonna give 22 000 vaccines you better make sure that the vaccines don t kill anybody Because if they kill one person you ve canceled out any benefit Kennedy described how the vaccine makers manipulated the data and the news to maximize profits He asked Dowd why he thinks there will be consequences Dowd said I think there s enough proof for people to investigate fraud in the clinical data and the FDA s complicity in this The tragic part of this is we

WHO proposed pandemic agreement widely known as the pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations IHR as part of the WHO Virtual Roundtable hosted by Children s Health Defense CHD The WHO s two proposed documents which the agency claims are designed to prepare the world for a future pandemic have been widely criticized as amounting to a power grab Critics say the agreement and amendments threaten national sovereignty health freedom personal liberties and free speech and promote risky gain of function research and health passports The WHO will vote on the proposals at the 77th World Health Assembly May 27 June 1 in Geneva Switzerland Panel participants included CHD CEO Mary Holland Sen Ron Johnson R Wis internist and founder of Door to Freedom Dr Meryl Nass and clinician physician and international public health consultant David Bell M D Ph D Award winning filmmaker Jan Jekielek senior news editor of The Epoch Times moderated the discussion Describing the roundtable as part of a much bigger civil society effort throughout the world to preserve human rights democracy and our children s future Holland told The Defender The WHO s two treaties are stealth efforts to achieve a global coup d état for one world government under the guise of public health Think of all the horrors that happened during COVID Holland said referring to the punitive measures enacted during the pandemic Now consider that the WHO is asserting authority to impose precisely these measures everywhere in the world The devil is in the details Opening the roundtable Holland said While the goals of this treaty and these regulations may seem noble and may seem like common sense the devil is in the details If enacted the documents will establish a kind of quasi international legal infrastructure for the kind of incredibly draconian measures that we saw during COVID Nass told viewers Nobody knows what is in these documents because the WHO has completely lied about them over and over again When you read the documents it s not about health at all It s really about accumulating power and centralizing it Johnson said that during the COVID 19 pandemic the WHO seized

review period for amendments to the regulations Nass accused the WHO of seeking to avoid public review There have been nine versions of the treaty and two or three versions of the amendments Nass said Neither document is in a final form yet and they re voting on them in 10 days It s an impossible situation but they don t want to delay Holland said the IHR contains recommendations for medical exams required vaccines quarantine and contact tracing If the new amendments are passed what are now recommendations could be transformed into binding measures she said A sovereignty grab The panelists agreed that the two documents pose a threat to national sovereignty If the WHO can order your country to pass laws and order what drugs it can use and what drugs it can t use and what vaccines have to be given there s no question that that s a sovereignty grab Nass said noting that the proposals also call for a compliance committee to ensure nation states comply with the new rules Holland referred to Article 12 of the proposed treaty which defines what constitutes a health emergency There s a single person who makes that determination the WHO director general Holland said There doesn t actually need to be an emergency just the potential for one Bell noted that while some question if the WHO s proposals will force nation states to cede sovereignty They re handing over power on when a pandemic will be declared and on a lot of the response to that pandemic In most people s parlance that would be regarded as sovereignty Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us WHO proposals would lead to huge surveillance network fast tracked vaccines Holland said another deeply concerning proposal is Article 15 of the treaty which provides Big Pharma governments and the WHO liability protection for their management and for so called novel vaccines Nass said this would also give the WHO the right to restrict the drugs that we are allowed to have during a pandemic The panelists said

44 of the proposed pandemic treaty combats the dissemination of alleged false and unreliable information She noted that it would be the WHO alone that will decide what is indeed false and misleading or unreliable According to Nass along with surveillance of online speech the documents also call for surveillance of medical records and surveillance of pathogens the latter via gain of function research genetic engineering and a library for potential biological warfare agents which they call potential pandemic pathogens They re setting up a huge surveillance network where every country will be monitored to ensure that it is surveilling for viral variants Bell said The WHO s director general could then declare a pandemic emergency based on risk followed by the imposition of lockdowns and development of mRNA vaccines in 100 days to give people their freedom back The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI and the pharmaceutical companies are building the platform for rapid vaccine development he added The proposals also call for a One Health approach which Nass described as a fundamentally different approach to the natural world where we re as concerned about the welfare of non human animals and the environment as we are about humans Holland said that while One Health has a nice ring to it it will result in commodifying humans on the same plane as animals and plants It looks like treating humans as a commodity as cattle as animals that you can tag Then you can have a digital ID you can lock them down you can mandate them to take experimental drugs This

highlighted a letter he sent to President Joe Biden signed by all 49 Senate Republicans urging him to submit all agreements with the WHO to the Senate Nass noted that 22 state attorneys general sent a letter to Biden asserting states rights over public health based on the 10th Amendment of the U S Constitution Clearly baked into the U S Constitution is the notion that the president cannot get us into international entanglements without that legislative engagement Holland said adding that the 10th Amendment states that any powers including health not specifically granted to the federal government are left to the states or the people Nass noted that several state legislatures have passed or are in the process of enacting their own legislation blocking the WHO from having jurisdiction in their states What this is is basically people power Nass said noting that tremendous numbers of constituents bugged their state reps She said several countries have also passed bills and

and Void In a groundbreaking ruling the New York State Supreme Court last week struck down the state s COVID 19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers holding that the state s health department lacked the authority to impose the mandate You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up In a groundbreaking ruling the New York State Supreme Court on Jan 13 struck down the state s COVID 19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers declaring it null void and of no effect and holding that the New York State Department of Health NYSDOH lacked the authority to impose the mandate Moreover the court ruled that the state s mandate was arbitrary and capricious on the basis that COVID 19 vaccines do not stop transmission of the virus thereby eliminating any rational basis for such a policy The lawsuit challenging the mandate was filed Oct 20 2022 by Medical Professionals for Informed Consent a group of medical practitioners impacted by the mandate and additional plaintiffs who were specifically named including two doctors a nurse a radiologic technologist and a medical laboratory specialist Defendants named in the lawsuit included the NYSDOH New York Gov Kathleen C Hochul and Mary T Bassett the state s health commissioner The lawsuit alleged the plaintiffs had lost or were at imminent risk of losing their jobs and that several of them had religious objections to receiving the vaccine but the mandate did not recognize those exemptions Judge Gerard Neri of the New York State Supreme Court in Onondaga County heard oral arguments in the case on Jan 5 in Syracuse New York Children s Health Defense CHD financed the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs In a press release issued after the ruling lead attorney Sujata Gibson stated This is a huge win for New York healthcare workers who have been deprived of their livelihoods for more than a year This is also a huge win for all New Yorkers who are facing dangerous and unprecedented healthcare worker shortages throughout New York State In the same press release Mary Holland president and general counsel of CHD said We are thrilled by this critical win against a COVID vaccine mandate correctly finding that any such mandate at this stage given current knowledge is arbitrary We hope that this decision will continue the trend towards lifting these dangerous and unwarranted vaccine mandates throughout the country Holland told The Defender I think there was never a time when an experimental under the Nuremberg Code and under state and federal law mandate should have been permissible And so I m really glad that

arbitrary and capricious Ruling doesn t restore health workers jobs but could influence mandate decisions nationwide Gibson noted that while the decision represents a significant victory against the vaccine mandates it does not on its own restore the positions of healthcare workers who lost their jobs as a result of the mandate but they can now reapply for those positions Individuals will have to reapply to their old jobs or new jobs at other facilities said Gibson What this decision does do however is take away the barrier of the state s COVID 19 vaccine mandate She added The damage done to New York s healthcare workers and to all New York residents is irreparable Thousands of people lost their jobs Countless had to cash out their retirement accounts to feed their families many lost their homes Far too many left the state Meanwhile thousands of patients were deprived of critical care due to the staffing shortages this mandate caused This lawsuit doesn t fix those serious harms but it does allow healthcare workers to go back to work without compromising their religious beliefs and it does mean that we have protection from similar unauthorized administrative overreach next time Moreover the ruling may impact other similar cases nationwide according to Gibson The judge struck down the mandate for two reasons The first basis that the NYSDOH lacks authority to issue any vaccine mandates under the state constitution and state public health law is precedential mostly in New York State The second basis however is applicable nationwide That is that it is irrational arbitrary and capricious to mandate a vaccine that cannot stop people from getting infected and spreading COVID 19 In an interview today on Good Morning CHD Gibson said the ruling shows that the tide is turning She reiterated that there is no credible basis to say that mandates are legally justified No credible basis to argue that they can meaningfully stop the spread of COVID if they can t stop the spread of COVID then it s just arbitrary and irrational Gibson also told The Defender the state said it is exploring its options following the ruling She said she can t predict what the state will

thousands of doctors nurses and other experienced and dedicated healthcare workers ready and willing to come back to work without this senseless mandate Holland agreed They really don t have good grounds she said as four sections of state law hold that only the legislature can enact vaccine mandates With a big freshman class of legislators state lawmakers would be asking for trouble if they attempted to introduce such mandates Holland noted that the ruling came just as a three day strike by thousands of nurses at two New York City hospitals ended Jan 12 One of their demands was more staffing Gov Hochul greeted nurses returning to work before dawn that morning It would be difficult for her to justify an appeal after she supported the striking nurses Holland said Lawsuit questioned mandate s legality referenced healthcare worker shortage The lawsuit questioned several aspects of the legality of New York s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers and illustrated the harm caused by the mandate in the context of an ongoing shortage of healthcare workers in the state The plaintiffs argued There is no rational basis for the Mandate when Respondent DOH acknowledges the mandated vaccine fails to accomplish its stated goal i e prevent the spread of COVID 19 The lawsuit also pointed out that the governor s emergency powers were rescinded on June 24 2021 but the state s health commissioner on June 22 2022 nevertheless made the mandate a permanent regulation in violation of sections 206 613 2164 and 2165 of New York s Public Health Law Section 206 states that the state s health commissioner may l establish and operate such adult and child immunization programs are as necessary to prevent or minimize the spread of disease and to protect the public health Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize mandatory immunization of adults or children except in limited circumstances outlined in sections 2164 and 2165 The plaintiffs argued that by enacting the mandate the

Mandate thousands of healthcare professionals including Petitioners are unable to work in their field anywhere in New York State The decision to take thousands of frontline workers out of the field at a time when there was already a labor shortage in the healthcare field has caused tremendous public outcry even among very pro vaccine leaders in the healthcare industry According to the lawsuit Gov Hochul recognized the mandate was exacerbating the healthcare worker shortage Governor Hochul admitted that her Mandate was causing a crisis preemptively declaring a state of emergency and with that invoking emergency powers the night before it took effect due to the healthcare worker shortage that she and the other Respondents caused Despite calling in the National Guard the crisis has only deepened since last year and the Governor has continuously renewed these state of emergency declarations on the grounds that the state faces a staffing crisis in healthcare The lawsuit referenced news articles from as early as September 2021 wherein even pro vaccine healthcare executives went on record questioning the mandate in light of the ongoing healthcare worker shortage Tom Quatroche president of the Erie County Medical Center on Sept 24 2021 told The New York Times the mandate had caused an unprecedented crisis and that even though for all the right reasons the vaccine mandate was put in place the reality is it is creating a public health crisis in hospitals with nobody to care for our patients The lawsuit cited the state s Syracuse region where the healthcare worker shortage resulted in a 20 decline in available hospital beds leading in some cases to patients being sent to hospitals hundreds of miles away In the midst of the mandate a similar percentage 17 of doctor and registered nurse positions throughout upstate New York were vacant according to September 2022 statistics from the Iroquois Healthcare Association One Sept 10 2021 news story referenced in

regarding adverse health effects of wireless technology when it decided that its 1996 radiofrequency emission guidelines protect the public s health The court s judgment states The case be remanded to the commission to provide a reasoned explanation for its determination that its guidelines adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation CHD Chairman and attorney on the case Robert F Kennedy Jr said The court s decision exposes the FCC and FDA as captive agencies that have abandoned their duty to protect public health in favor of a single minded crusade to increase telecom industry profits CHD s case was consolidated with another similar case that was filed by the Environmental Health Trust The organizations filed joint briefs in the case CHD s lead attorney for the case Scott McCollough a telecommunication and administrative law attorney who represented the petitioners in the hearing said This is an historic win The FCC will have to re open the

out the hope for sober minded decisions according to the rule of law I eagerly await FCC action in compliance with the court s ruling This historic case was filed by CHD on Feb 2 2020 The case challenged the agency s decision not to review its 25 year old radio frequency emissions RF guidelines which regulate the radiation emitted by wireless technology devices such as cell phones and iPads and infrastructure cell towers Wi Fi and smart meters and to promulgate biologically and evidence based guidelines that adequately protect public health In 1996 the FCC adopted guidelines which only protect consumers from adverse effects occurring at levels of radiation that cause thermal effects temperature change in tissue while ignoring substantial evidence of profound harms from pulsed and modulated RF radiation at non thermal levels The FCC hasn t reviewed its guidelines or the evidence since despite clear scientific evidence of harm and growing rates of RF related sickness In 2012 the Government Accountability Office of Congress published a report recommending the FCC reassess its guidelines As a result in 2013 the FCC published an inquiry to decide whether the guidelines should be reviewed It opened docket 13 84 for the public to file comments Thousands of comments and scientific evidence by scientists medical organizations and doctors as well as hundreds of comments by people who have become sick from this radiation were filed in support of new rules Nevertheless on Dec 4 2019 the FCC closed the docket and published its decision affirming the adequacy of its guidelines

car s tires can emit up to a trillion ultrafine particles per kilometer according to testing by Emissions Analytics Many of the particles from this chemical cocktail include heavy metals and the toxic chemical 6PPD which can harm aquatic life and human health particularly for those living or working along roadways You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Jim Robbins For decades concerns about automobile pollution have focused on what comes out of the tailpipe Now researchers and regulators say we need to pay more attention to toxic emissions from tires as vehicles roll down the road At the top of the list of worries is a chemical called 6PPD which is added to rubber tires to help them last longer When tires wear on pavement 6PPD is released It reacts with ozone to become a different chemical 6PPD quinone which can be extremely toxic so much so that it has been linked to repeated fish kills in Washington state The trouble with tires doesn t stop there Tires are made primarily of natural rubber and synthetic rubber but they contain hundreds of other ingredients often including steel and heavy metals such as copper lead cadmium and zinc As car tires wear the rubber disappears in particles both bits that can be seen with the naked eye and microparticles Testing by a British company Emissions Analytics found that a car s tires emit 1 trillion ultrafine particles per kilometer driven from 5 to 9 pounds of rubber per internal combustion car per year And what s in those particles is a mystery because tire ingredients are proprietary You ve got a chemical cocktail in these tires that no one really understands and is kept highly confidential by the tire manufacturers said Nick Molden CEO of Emissions Analytics We struggle to think of another consumer product that is so prevalent in the world and used by virtually everyone where there is so little known of what is in them Regulators have only begun to address the toxic tire problem though there has been some action on 6PPD The chemical was identified by a team of researchers led by scientists at Washington State University and the University of Washington who were trying to determine why coho salmon returning to Seattle area creeks to spawn were dying in large numbers Working for the Washington Stormwater Center the scientists tested some 2 000 substances to determine which one was causing the die offs and in 2020 they announced they d found the culprit 6PPD The Yurok Tribe in Northern California along with two other West Coast Native American tribes have petitioned the U S

has begun taking steps to regulate the chemical last year classifying tires containing it as a priority product which requires manufacturers to search for and test substitutes 6PPD plays a crucial role in the safety of tires on California s roads and currently there are no widely available safer alternatives said Karl Palmer a deputy director at the state s Department of Toxic Substances Control Palmer continued For this reason our framework is ideally suited for identifying alternatives to 6PPD that ensure the continued safety of tires on California s roads while protecting California s fish populations and the communities that rely on them The U S Tire Manufacturers Association says it has mobilized a consortium of 16 tire manufacturers to carry out an analysis of alternatives Anne Forristall Luke the association s president and CEO said it will yield the most effective and exhaustive review possible of whether a safer alternative to 6PPD in tires currently exists Molden however said there is a catch If they don t investigate they aren t allowed to sell in the state of California he said If they investigate and don t find an alternative they can go on selling They don t have to find a substitute And today there is no alternative to 6PPD California is also studying a request by the California Stormwater Quality Association to classify tires containing zinc a heavy metal as a priority product requiring manufacturers to search for an alternative Zinc is used in the vulcanization process to increase the strength of the rubber When it comes to tire particles though there hasn t been any action even as the problem worsens with the proliferation of electric cars Because of their quicker acceleration and greater torque electric vehicles

quarters of microplastics entering the ocean come from the synthetic rubber in tires according to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the British company Systemiq There are still a great many unknowns in tire emissions which can be especially complex to analyze because heat and pressure can transform tire ingredients into other compounds One outstanding research question is whether 6PPD q

died at age 62 of brain cancer By the time he passed away I had heard countless tales of his legal wranglings in depositions and on the stand Cases where he served as an expert witness for lawsuits on behalf of people harmed by exposure to dangerous chemicals lawsuits against some of the biggest chemical companies in the world The defense attorney s strategy with my father was always the same undermine his expertise and rattle his equanimity so juries would trust well paid lawyers not my dad There was the time they quoted an excerpt of one of his journal articles to make it sound like he was contradicting himself which backfired when he asked the lawyer to read for the jury the rest of the paragraph putting the words in context and solidifying his point The worst story was from a trial not long after my stepmother died in a tragic accident leaving behind my three younger half siblings As my dad walked to the stand one of the defense lawyers said under his breath Marc how was

Brian Bienkowski Chemicals used to make plastics more flexible are linked to more than 356 000 deaths annually across the globe creating what researchers called a substantial global health burden according to a new peer reviewed study The study published Tuesday in the journal eBiomedicine is the first to estimate heart disease deaths from exposure to di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate DEHP a class of phthalate chemicals that are used in raincoats food packaging shower curtains PVC flooring and pipes IV bags and other items The chemicals make plastics softer and more pliable but are associated with multiple health problems including hormone disruption obesity diabetes infertility cancer and heart problems The study does not prove DEHP causes heart related deaths however it adds to evidence that exposure to the widespread chemicals and the plastics that carry them could raise people s risk of heart disease The new study comes as U S regulators are undertaking a risk evaluation of DEHP to see if it requires further regulation and are accepting public comments on the review until May 6 The study also adds to a global debate over how to limit plastics and other chemicals linked to human and environmental health problems The researchers used environmental and health data from 200 countries and territories to estimate DEHP exposure and compared this to 2018 mortality data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation an independent population health research organization The researchers estimated DEHP exposure contributed to 356 238 deaths which represents 13 of all global deaths from heart disease in 2018 among people aged 55 to 64 The authors calculated that these premature deaths caused a 510 billion economic burden People from countries in the Middle East South Asia East Asia and the Pacific accounted for roughly half the estimated deaths India had the highest estimated DEHP linked heart disease death total with more than 100 000 This study uncovers a

000 premature deaths among older people in the U S each year mostly from heart disease In addition a 2023 review found that most recent studies examining the link between phthalates and heart problems found an association including strokes arrhythmias hypertension and other problems It s not entirely clear how phthalates including DEHP could impact the heart But researchers say they could potentially disrupt receptors that are crucial for metabolism and increase oxidative stress both of which can lead to heart problems and disease Laura Vandenberg Ph D a researcher and professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health Health Sciences said it s likely that the heart disease link is due to these indirect effects of phthalates including DEHP Phthalates in general are known on a molecular level to increase levels of oxidative stress and also to serve as obesogens and metabolic disrupting chemicals Vandenberg said Obesogens refer to chemicals that cause our bodies to produce more fat Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease and oxidative stress which causes cell damage can lead to heart problems as well Microplastics and nonplastics carry chemicals along for the ride Trasande said but it s possible the tiny bits of plastics themselves also might be causing tissue injury leading to heart impacts When asked about the new study Kevin Ott executive director of the Flexible Vinyl Alliance which advocates for the use of PVC plastics pointed to a 2018 U S Food and Drug Administration FDA study that stated there hadn t been a human health study that connected phthalates and human health impacts Academic studies however are consistently at odds with the FDA s stance A large 2022 study that reviewed phthalates human health research found links to multiple health problems and that health risks can occur at exposure levels below the safe dose levels set out by regulators The Flexible Vinyl Alliance petitioned the FDA in 2018 to remove 23 phthalates from use in any materials that contact food during processing packaging storage or handling saying that industry had already stopped using

with regrettable substitutions he said If we reduce DEHP I m not convinced you ll reduce this mortality But if you reduced plastic use or phthalates as a class you would An opportunity to get DEHP out of products Globally about 3 million to 4 million tons of DEHP are produced each year representing about 40 of the chemicals used to make plastics softer Under the Toxic Substances Control Act the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA considers DEHP a high priority substance which triggered a risk evaluation happening now to see if it requires further regulation The agency which already has a 6 parts per billion limit for DEHP in drinking water is accepting public comments on the DEHP review until May 6 There s an opportunity to get DEHP out of as many products as possible said Judith Enck president of Beyond Plastics a nonprofit organization that fights plastic pollution She added that DEHP has not been studied enough and pointed out that millions of Americans get drinking water from PVC pipes which contain DEHP After 40 or 50 years many cities are getting around to replacing lead service lines and we don t want to replace those with PVC she said adding that Beyond Plastics is advocating for copper lines Trasande said the best available data suggests our diets are the main route of exposure for DEHP but it s not clear that s the case across the globe He suggested some simple steps that won t break the bank to limit exposure including using glass and stainless steel containers instead of plastic not microwaving plastic and looking at recycling numbers as 3 is for

Infertility Micro and nanoplastics affect people s hormonal systems leading to infertility and neurological and behavioral disorders a new review found Scientists and health advocates called on global leaders to ignore industry calls for more recycling and instead pass a treaty limiting plastics production You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Natasha Gilbert Tiny bits of plastic pollution are found all across the natural environment from the deep ocean to Arctic ice This widespread contamination comes from the manufacture and overuse of plastics which degrade over time and leach toxic chemicals into the environment and the food system The chemicals in micro and nanoplastics MNPs cause a plethora of health impacts including harming people s hormonal systems leading to infertility and neurological and behavioral disorders among other issues says a new review which unpacks the mechanisms of how plastics harm health Typically people consume microplastics from contaminated food and drinking water ingesting around 50 000 particles each year People can also inhale micro and nanoplastics and absorb them through skin contact Most microplastics in the atmosphere come from the wear and tear of vehicle tires and brake pads Researchers estimate that the harmful health effects from toxic chemicals in microplastics cost the U S nearly 250 billion in healthcare expenses in one year To tackle the plastic epidemic and its health harms scientists and health advocates are pushing for world leaders to commit to curbing plastic production in a legally binding United Nations treaty due to be voted on next month in Geneva Switzerland The plastics and fossil fuel industry objects to curbs on production arguing instead for more recycling But scientists and pollution advocates say that very little plastic is ever recycled and doing so adds to the spread of toxic chemicals in the plastics We are already seeing the impacts of plastic pollution on our health and our children s health The solution is to cap and reduce plastic production said Tracey Woodruff professor and director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment University of California San Francisco Messing with the endocrine system The tiny bits of plastic contain endocrine disrupting chemicals which can accumulate in body tissues and organs such as ovaries and testes where they bind to hormone receptors and interfere with their function the review authors wrote The chemicals also mess with key parts of the body s endocrine system including the hypothalamus an area of the brain that helps regulate hormones and the nervous system and controls body temperature and blood pressure among other central processes For example studies have found that endocrine disrupting chemicals interfere with the molecules produced by the hypothalamus that signal to the body when it is time to eat or sleep MNPs also affect several other organs involved in the endocrine system",

involved in the endocrine system wrote the review authors These include the pituitary gland in the brain which makes hormones involved in reproduction and fertility and the thyroid gland found in the neck which produces hormones that control how the body uses energy Long term exposure to MNPs harms the development and function of the thyroid gland the review authors wrote Studies show that rats fed a daily diet of nanoplastics and polystyrene for five weeks produced less of two key thyroid hormones known as thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine T3 Endocrine disrupting chemicals mainly interfere with the function of the pituitary gland by messing with the hypothalamus They reduce levels of hormones important to the reproductive system such as follicle stimulating hormone which is involved in the production of sperm and eggs This can lead to infertility and possibly cancer of the uterus the review authors write Harming reproduction Reproductive organs comprising the ovaries and testes are very sensitive to the damaging effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in micro and nanoplastics wrote the review authors Studies in rodents exposed to microplastics found that the plastics build up in the uterine tissue and ovaries They also found a drop in the production of proteins that provide structural support for cells and are involved in cell movement The ovaries also weighed less and produced fewer mature follicles the sacks that contain developing eggs Tests in mice that drank water contaminated with microplastics found that mice s ovaries showed signs of oxidative stress a condition where antioxidants in the body are unable to combat free radicals unstable and highly reactive molecules that can damage cells Microplastics are linked to a decrease in pregnancies and an increase in offspring mortality wrote the review authors Microplastics also cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the male testes Studies in mice that were fed polystyrene microplastics for 28 days found a reduction in sperm number and quality and lower testosterone levels These findings suggest MNPs could be contributing to the continuing decline in male fertility rates seen over the last 80 years Better controls on plastic pollution Plastic production and use continue to grow as does the evidence of its harm to human health particularly in vulnerable populations like children and

her they didn t do deficiency testing but Alimonti insisted Nope she said I m not starting it until I get the test back The test showed that Alimonti had a copy of a risky gene variant so doctors gave her a lower dose of the drug Even that has been hard to tolerate she s had to skip doses because of low white blood cell counts Alimonti said She still doesn t know whether her insurer will cover the

investigation found some of the oil giant s spills have been going on for 20 plus years including one larger than the Exxon Valdez disaster from which Chevron profited over 11 million You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Janet Wilson Oil giant Chevron has agreed to pay a record setting 13 million to two California agencies for past oil spills but some of the company s spills are ongoing The fines announced on March 20 come more than three years after an investigation by The Desert Sun and ProPublica found that oil companies are profiting from illegal spills and that oversight of the industry by California s oil and gas division was lax At least one of Chevron s spills is still running 21 years after it began in a Kern County oil field although a state spokesperson said it has been reduced by 98 from its peak The amount spilled from the site dubbed GS 5 is larger than the Exxon Valdez disaster The crude collected from GS 5 generated an estimated 11 6 million in just three years The Desert Sun and ProPublica found In fact rather than stopping potentially deadly inland spills known as surface expressions oil companies have routinely tried to contain them with netting or pieces of metal and used more than 100 of them as unpermitted oil production sites in Kern and Santa Barbara counties This week s announcement stopped short of saying GS 5 and other ongoing spills must be stopped as required under state law Instead officials said the settlement creates a framework for managing the spills with State oversight and Chevron agrees to continue monitoring the site with Department of Conservation oversight No specific sites were named In follow up emails and a phone call spokespeople for the state said the fines cover the first phase of the Cymric spill in which a river of thick crude flowed down a natural watershed Chevron for several years denied it posed a risk to health and the environment and the company fought a 1 6 million fine imposed by state regulators The penalties also cover dozens of smaller spills that killed or damaged wildlife and habitat The new fines which will be paid to the Department of Conservation and

decadeslong GS 5 spill Department of Conservation spokesperson Jacob Roper said As mitigation continues less oil finds its way to the surface Mitigation measures include injecting water underground to improve ground stability sealing subsurface leak paths and removing fluids in shallow areas before they can reach the surface The injected fluid gradually cools hot steam to not create more boiling spills At the spill s peak in 2019 Roper noted about 2 500 barrels of oil and water came to the surface each day At the start of 2024 that had fallen to 80 and it has since dropped to 68 In an email

mandates it s only a matter of time before this question reaches the U S Supreme Court The Court has never ruled directly on the question of religious liberty and vaccine mandates but it has dealt with mandates Jacobson v Massachusetts 1905 involved an adult man Henning Jacobson of Cambridge Massachusetts The city following a state statute had mandated the smallpox vaccine during an epidemic and had fined Jacobson 5 for failing to comply He argued that his state s mandate violated his right to individual liberty under the 14th Amendment The Supreme Court disagreed with Jacobson It ruled 7 2 that states have broad authority under their police powers to enact public health measures including compulsory vaccinations when necessary to protect the community In Zucht v King 1922 the Supreme Court ruled that schools could mandate vaccines In Cantwell 1940 however the Court found that states needed to have a compelling state interest to restrict religious freedom Half a century later Smith 1990 lowered the bar for states to overrule religious liberty claims The Religious Freedom Restoration Act 1993 partially rebalanced the scales And recent Court decisions suggest that the Court may soon send Smith to the recycle bin None of these cases however involved a potential conflict between religious liberty and a vaccine mandate So these questions remain If presented with the issue

Court should recognize the legitimacy of at least some religious liberty objections to vaccine mandates This is true even if one believes the seven vote majority decided correctly in 1905 that states could mandate the smallpox vaccine Such mandates always involve crucial questions of fact In Jacobson the Court took for granted several of what it viewed as facts 1 Smallpox vaccines they assumed had a long history of immunizing recipients against a highly infectious and deadly disease 2 there were few alternative treatments for the infected 3 the cost of refusing the Massachusetts mandate a small fine was not all that burdensome 4 the risk of the vaccine itself was quite low and 5 finally they assumed such a mandate was needed for public safety Given all this they rejected his appeal to personal liberty Few of these premises apply to childhood vaccines on the 2025 childhood schedule still less to the schedule as a whole On the contrary every newly approved vaccine benefits from unmerited prestige laundering from the smallpox and polio vaccines As a result the assumption that states have a compelling public interest in mandating every vaccine on the entire childhood vaccine schedule even over sincere religious objections is way past its expiration date That claim may seem controversial even scandalous to readers who encountered a modest vaccine protocol as children or parents As a child I received smallpox with a painless bifurcated needle the oral polio vaccine and DTP injections For some reason I didn t get the measles vaccine and got measles when I was 4 So my experience with childhood vaccines was quite modest For much of my life I thought little about vaccines and had no reason to doubt the wisdom of the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Young parents today live in a different universe The current CDC schedule involves 68 shots between birth and age 18 and many of these shots contain multiple antigens Most of these were added after 1986 when the federal government granted immunity from liability for injury to vaccine manufacturers Many of these parents are aware of the chronic

parents are much less inclined to trust public health agencies According to a recent Zogby poll about half of American adults now want the CDC to reconsider the schedule for children The many widely known problems with the schedule and the approval process behind it are now breeding skepticism about the whole public health enterprise Still most Americans are not yet vaccine skeptics Many young parents simply want to space out vaccine doses or delay or decline a few of them For their trouble many find that their doctor school board and next door neighbor treat the entire schedule as an inflexible moral decree Despite this pressure millions of American parents across the political spectrum resist They are like committed pro lifers before 2022 who did not treat the constitutional right to abortion as either just or settled law Many of these parents endure personal hardships because of de facto mandates They exchange the names of doctors who won t pressure them to stick with the schedule They avoid both public and private schools Some even pack up and move I know one tech entrepreneur who moved his family from a large city in one state to a rural area of another state and bought a little schoolhouse for local parents who wanted to avoid the mandates We no longer live in an era when most informed Americans will simply trust the word of a doctor or government scientist wearing a white lab coat That s due in part to their recognition that the processes that give rise to public health policies including vaccine mandates are murky and untrustworthy The vaccines and mandates are the result of laws and policies at both the federal and state levels The FDA approves new drugs based on trials conducted by the drug companies themselves The CDC then determines whether to recommend a vaccine and for whom But it is the states which have jurisdiction over medical licensing and practice that mandate their use The result is a frustrating game of blame shifting Dr

factory that I shut down he insisted Never I never did Despite or perhaps because of such shell games legal challenges to vaccine mandates are inevitable Based on recent evidence it s likely some of these will be framed in terms of religious liberty The argument for vaccine freedom Religious liberty is a species of the genus liberty One could mount a formidable case against vaccine mandates based simply on individual liberty without an appeal to religious belief One could appeal for instance to the liberty and rights of parents to make decisions involving their children Consider the following argument little of which depends on claims about high risk from any one vaccine 1 The question in Jacobson 1905 was whether the state could under certain conditions mandate a vaccine for infectious diseases to protect the public The details matter The Court assumed certain things about the nature of the vaccine the risk of smallpox at the time and the severity of the mandate None of these assumptions holds for most if any vaccines on the current CDC schedule Smallpox was extremely infectious and had in 1905 an infection fatality rate of about 30 The pre vaccine rate for COVID 19 in contrast was many orders of magnitude smaller for all but the elderly There was an epidemic underway Moreover by 1905 some version of the smallpox vaccine had been in use for over a century The punishment for failing to comply with the mandate was not ostracism but a modest 5 fine equivalent to about 182 in 2025 In contrast an appeal to public health or the common good to compel parents to embrace the entire childhood vaccine schedule in 2025 is quite weak 2 The advent of antibiotics which can be life saving for those with post infection illness from respiratory viruses and other technological and medical innovations makes the contrast between 1905 and 2025 even more dramatic One example more than 98 of the reduction in measles deaths in the 20th century occurred before 1963 when the first measles vaccine was approved One can suss this out with the information at the CDC History of Measles page but don t expect them to highlight it Here s a figure illustrating it at Our Word in Data The figure starts at 1919 since data before that time is considered unreliable Grok estimates the death reduction before 1963 as 99 53 So to be generous the measles vaccine can gain credit for at most 1 5 of the reduction of measles deaths since 1911 Similar considerations apply to", "chunk_id":

1963 as 99 53 So to be generous the measles vaccine can gain credit for at most 1 5 of the reduction of measles deaths since 1911 Similar considerations apply to many of the vaccines on the childhood schedule 3 Few of the drugs on the current schedule confer complete immunity from infection and transmission of the disease in question Strictly speaking these drugs change the pathogen host relationship That is they can reduce the risk of severe disease to the recipient but don t do what most laypeople including most parents think a vaccine should do In late 2020 and 2021 for instance millions of Americans saw public health officials insist that COVID 19 vaccines prevented infection which was known to be untrue even at the time As a result some people deem the personal benefit of the shot to be greater than the risk Others decide the opposite For such drugs even if they re called vaccines the public health argument is much weaker since the benefit is primarily for the recipient and the recipient is presumably at much less risk of severe illness from infection from others 4 The public health argument is even weaker for any vaccine that does confer total lifelong immunity The point should be obvious If I have received such a vaccine I can t get sick from be infected by or transmit the virus in question Unvaccinated people do not put me at risk It should make no difference to me who else is vaccinated Anyone worried about the disease can get the vaccine So again the case for compulsory vaccination is weak especially in a country that prizes parents rights individual liberty and rights of conscience 5 Even a superficial study of the vaccines added since the 1986 NCVIA National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act which provided immunity from liability to drug manufacturers does not inspire confidence An informed observer would be struck by the diminishing returns on vaccines over the last century It s hard to resist the suspicion that the 1986 legal liability shield created a strong incentive for drug companies to develop and lobby for drugs that can be classified as vaccines even for diseases that are only a risk for small populations Take the

doses of RECOMBIVAX HB 5 mcg administered to 147 healthy infants and children up to 10 years of age who were monitored for 5 days after each dose That is not especially compelling or comforting 6 Parents in 2025 have ample reason for concern that drugs are added to the schedule for reasons other than the safety of their children They see the perverse effects of the 1986 NCVIA National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act the chronic childhood disease crisis the third party payer mandate for vaccines from the Affordable Care Act the third party financial incentives given to doctors who have a high fraction of their patients fully vaccinated and so much of what we have witnessed from public health authorities since 2020 7 The schedule now includes 68 shots from age 0 18 not counting the shots recommended for pregnant mothers with several containing multiple antigens for example MMR Even if every individual vaccine on the schedule were shown to be safe that would tell us nothing about the cumulative safety of the entire schedule which the National Institutes of Health has resisted testing 8 The childhood chronic disease epidemic correlates with the growth in the childhood vaccine schedule It s reasonable to wonder if the schedule is contributing to the crisis In Bayesian terms the prior probability that the total schedule contributes to chronic disease is much higher in 2025 than it was in say 1967 or 1986 9 As Catherine Pakaluk argues in her recent essay on parents rights and vaccine mandates an adult can choose to bear a private risk for a public good but that doesn t apply to one s children It is not reasonable to require that parents whose job is to protect their children from harm put their own children at risk for a putative social benefit Of course not giving a child a vaccine might also put the child at risk The point is simply that the individual risk for social reward argument falls flat when applied to a small child who cannot exercise informed consent

simply that the individual risk for social reward argument falls flat when applied to a small child who cannot exercise informed consent And some of the shots on the schedule such as the ones for COVID 19 confer little benefit for children since children have a near zero risk of death and severe illness from COVID 19 and the effects of the drugs are quite short lived 10 Parents have natural incentives to protect their children As a result genuinely net beneficial childhood vaccines for which the benefits to the child clearly outweigh the risks don t need to be mandated In fact for widespread deadly and highly infectious diseases most parents would clamor to have their child receive a well tested and relatively safe vaccine In extreme cases many might even sign a waiver promising not to hold the drug company liable for injury Given the above an appeal to parental rights alone should suffice for a parent to decline or delay a vaccine for his or her child The religious liberty argument That said a sincere religious liberty argument building on the points above is even stronger when applied to parents acting on behalf of their children Such arguments depend on particular facts of course so here is one argument I could make if my wife and I had a newborn in 2025 Let s use the hepatitis B vaccine as an example I could apply it with relevant adjustments to others such as the COVID 19 vaccines I believe I am morally obligated by God to protect my children and their well being Catechism of the Catholic Church 2221 2231 From careful research and the fact that my wife does not have hepatitis B I have concluded that giving my newborn the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth provides little to no health benefit for my child The details of the drug trial based on which this drug was approved are weak by any reasonable scientific standard The risk to my child of receiving the vaccine might be low But given the limitations of the relevant studies I m agnostic on the question In any case I know that the risk of my child contracting hepatitis B is extremely low I know that this vaccine was added to the schedule in 1991 in part to increase compliance and because of the difficulty of targeting the at risk adult population This vaccine would provide little to no benefit to others because it does not prevent either infection or

does not have hepatitis B at birth is extremely unlikely to contract it during childhood and the intervention is not known to confer lifelong immunity I m not a utilitarian Even if the vaccine given on the first day of birth provided some benefits to society say by preventing infection in others I believe it is unjust for me to impose on my newborn child a concrete risk for an abstract and speculative social benefit The Nuremberg Code on the treatment of POWs prohibits any medical experiments on prisoners for community benefit unless the recipient freely assents Surely the standards for the treatment of prisoners of war are not higher than the standards for children under the care of their parents Therefore I have a strong religious objection to giving my child the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth Ideally the Supreme Court would not be asked to rule on such a question until the problems sketched here are more widely known The media and public officials have relegated questions about vaccine safety to the fringe for decades As a result the Justices may incorrectly assume as most people do that the risk of all approved vaccines both individually and jointly is low relative to the individual and social benefits Still we re way past the time when Americans are obliged to give the FDA CDC and other public health agencies the benefit of the doubt If they want to be trusted they must act in a trustworthy manner Parents in particular can have strong moral and religious reasons to delay or forgo for their young children drugs on the

minimal and inadequate safety testing and the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has never tested the cumulative effect of the vaccine schedule on childhood health outcomes he said During the roundtable Del Bigtree CEO of the Informed Consent Action Network ICAN also addressed the lack of sufficient testing None of the 14 routine vaccines on the CDC s recommended schedule was ever put through long term double blind placebo based safety trials prior to licensure Bigtree said Since this type of trial is really the only way to establish that a pharmaceutical product is safe it is misinformation to state that the vaccines are safe Hooker said research shows that for every one child that is saved from death from COVID 19 there are 30 child deaths associated with the COVID 19 vaccine So the risk to benefit ratio in terms of mortality is 30 to 1 Bigtree said the incidence of chronic illness in children has significantly increased In the 1980s when we were giving 11 doses of about three vaccines the chronic illness rate which includes neurological and autoimmune disease was 12 8 Once we passed the 1986 Act and we had the gold rush of vaccines explode the chronic illness

until they do proper safety testing Bigtree said referring to ICAN v FDA filed in March 2020 in the U S District Court for the Southern District of New York A decision is pending Government withholding data on outcomes for vaccinated unvaccinated children According to Hooker government health agencies possess data on health outcomes for vaccinated and unvaccinated children but have refused to publicize it They do not publish the results or let any independent scientist in to look at that information he said They refuse to publish the results and they really know why It s because the bloated vaccination schedule is responsible and is I would say in part responsible for the epidemic of chronic disorders that we see in children in the U S Hooker said public health agencies have the records which are contained in a database called the Vaccine Safety Datalink It s over 10 million individuals with 2 million from 10 participating HMOs I would say that within that database there are at least 10 000 unvaccinated children that can be studied He added You are not able to access the Vaccine Safety Datalink which has almost 30 years worth of research from these HMOs It should be open to the public Hooker said the CDC has not responded to over 120 FOIA Freedom of Information Act requests he submitted adding that he has gone through congressional representatives to get the Vaccine Safety Datalink itself It is simply something that they will not do According to Hooker this is because of financial conflicts of interest involving the CDC CDC buys and sells 5 billion worth of vaccines a year through the Vaccines for Children program They also spend half a billion dollars a year advertising and through public relationship campaigns for vaccinations in general as compared to a woeful budget of 50 million that is being used for vaccine safety every year During Monday s roundtable Rodney Palmer a Canadian journalist formerly with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and

National Institutes of Health are derelict in their duty to protect children and adults against vaccine injury in order to report to Congress the state of vaccine safety science and their responsibility to the American public and to public health in order to protect the American public according to Hooker Hooker continued The CDC will not look at vaccinated versus unvaccinated children because they know what the outcome would be and independent researchers have shown that for a large number of chronic diseases even infectious diseases the unvaccinated children fare better and the unvaccinated children are healthier Noting that 28 vaccines are given in the first year of life one vaccine on the first day of life and upwards to eight vaccines when an infant is just two months old Hooker said If you look at the aluminum toxicity alone it far surpasses the single day toxicity limit for aluminum exposure in newborns There is no study no official study by the CDC FDA NIH where they ve looked at the 28 vaccines in totality what the cumulative effect would be versus completely unvaccinated children They just refuse to do that study he said Hooker added that When you look at

for children in the U S and Europe and exposure to chemicals is driving the epidemic according to a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine The authors 25 scientists economists and legal scholars representing 17 U S and European Union EU institutions called for new laws and regulations governing chemicals that according to their data analyses are largely responsible for the chronic disease epidemic in children An estimated 350 000 manufactured chemicals chemical mixtures and plastics listed in global inventories are subject to few legal or policy constraints the paper stated Less than 20 of these chemicals were tested for toxicity particularly in infants and children Production of these chemicals has increased 50 fold since 1950 and is projected to triple from current levels by 2050 according to the authors who published their collective work under the Consortium for Children s Environmental Health According to the paper Unlike pharmaceuticals synthetic chemicals are brought to market with little prior assessment of their health impacts and almost no post marketing surveillance for longer term adverse health effects A large body of evidence links multiple pediatric NCDs non communicable diseases to synthetic chemicals Two key lessons emerged from these cases toxic chemicals can cross the placenta and children are far more vulnerable to toxic chemicals than adults Non communicable diseases are the principal causes of illness and death in children today and their incidence and prevalence are on the rise the paper stated The paper cited data indicating that in the last 50 years there have been significant increases in cancer rates autism diagnoses and neurodevelopmental disorders reproductive defects obesity asthma and other health

He told The Defender the authors wrote the paper because of their grave concern over the increases in non communicable diseases among children Landrigran said At present we are conducting a vast toxicologic experiment in the United States in which our children and grandchildren are the unwitting and consenting subjects as they are exposed daily to hundreds of manufactured chemicals We think that this is fundamentally unethical and immoral and that it must change Chemicals are by no means the only cause of rising rates of chronic disease in American children but they are an important and insufficiently addressed cause It was against this background that we brought together a group of authors of multiple disciplines including physicians toxicologists lawyers and policy experts to write this paper Landrigan said that with the Trump administration set to take office later this month now is an opportune time to raise awareness about the risks of toxic chemicals We think it is very important to put this information out in the public space in the hopes that people of conscience in the new federal administration will recognize that it is simply not ethical to continue to produce and use untested chemicals that have potential to cause disease in children Landrigan said He suggested that in addition to influencing federal policymakers the paper may also encourage state lawmakers to take action We are well aware that not all power in the United States is centered in Washington and that there is also much power in the states Landrigan said We are hoping that some states might decide on the basis of our findings to take action to reduce children s exposure to some of the most toxic chemicals currently on markets Zen Honeycutt founding executive director of Moms

this trend and protecting children from the dangers of exposure to toxic chemicals will require fundamental changes to current law policy and regulations governing the chemical industry and to the chemical industry itself The largest gap in current policies and legislation and countries such as the U S is the fact that chemicals are presumed innocent before they come to market and that no pre market toxicity testing of chemicals is required Landrigan said The paper cites several examples of U S laws that it argues are deficient and in need of change For instance the Toxic Substances Control Act is based on a statutory promise to protect public health and the environment from unreasonable risks posed by chemicals However the law failed to give the U S Environmental Protection Agency the authority required to fulfill this promise Calling it broken legislation the study argues that the law effectively encourages unfettered chemical production at the expense of children s health The paper also highlights multibillion dollar subsidies to U S chemical and plastic manufacturers from the U S government and trade secret protections allowing them to claim that virtually all

protection over unconstrained production of chemicals and plastics is required to safeguard children s health and reduce the incidence of chronic health conditions Chemicals should no longer be presumed harmless until proven otherwise the authors said Instead chemicals and chemical based products should be allowed to enter and remain on markets only if their manufacturers can establish by rigorous independent testing that they are not toxic at anticipated levels of exposure Chemical manufacturers and brands marketing chemical products should also be required to conduct postmarketing surveillance for longer term adverse effects especially in pediatric populations the study suggests Testing would be conducted by independent bodies and not the manufacturers themselves The study also calls for mandated chemical footprinting to monitor chemical products once they enter the supply chain similar to monitoring prescription drugs And the authors propose a legally binding global

The human body also has natural EMFs as many of your bodily processes involve the transmission of electric signals and as noted by Demasi External interference can disrupt those signals In a 2016 article Jerry Phillips Ph D a biochemist and director of the Excel Science Center at the University of Colorado explained how living cells react to RF radiation The signal couples with cells although nobody really knows what the nature of that coupling is Some effects of that reaction can be things like movement of calcium across membranes the production of free radicals or a change in the expression of genes in the cell Suddenly important proteins are being expressed at times and places and in amounts that they shouldn t be and that has a dramatic effect on the function of the cells And some of these changes are consistent with what s seen when cells undergo conversion from normal to malignant When you consider that your body runs on bioelectricity it s easier to understand how and why biological damage from wireless phones might occur For starters your body has natural EMFs as many of your bodily processes involve the transmission of electric signals and external interference can disrupt those signals In the past few years it s become increasingly clear that mitochondrial dysfunction is at the root of most chronic diseases so in terms of public health the effects of chronic EMF exposure may be far more profound than suspected We may not only face an avalanche of brain cancer in the coming decades but also heart disease neurological disease and

of heart tumors and damage to the brain and DNA This 25 million research conducted by the National Toxicology Program an interagency research program housed at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is said to be the most extensive to date and it confirms that the heart and brain are key areas affected by high chronic EMF exposure Earlier research by Allan Frey Office of Naval Research also revealed cellphone radiation weakens cell membranes including your blood brain barrier placing your brain at further increased risk by allowing systemic toxins to enter Male testes are a third area with high voltage gated calcium channel density and indeed studies have linked EMF exposure to male fertility problems as well Cellphone radiation has been linked to a reduction in sperm motility and viability and Wi Fi equipped laptops have been linked to sperm DNA fragmentation after just four hours of use Disturbingly most people will carry their cellphones either in their breast pocket or pants pocket effectively radiating the most sensitive parts of their body their heart and reproductive organs Then when talking on the phone they will place it to their ear exposing their

Why we re not seeing dramatic increases in brain cancer With regard to brain cancer it s important to remember that brain cancer typically has a long latency period According to Davis it took 40 years before the brain cancer rate in the Japanese population spiked after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima Compared to radioactive radiation RF is likely far less carcinogenic but the fact that we have not seen a dramatic increase in brain cancer rates as of yet is by no means proof that flooding your brain with RFs is harmless It simply means we haven t been using cellphones long enough yet In my view it seems really foolish to make such a gamble with entire generations of people Davis also points out that if you want to get an indication of how cellphone use is influencing brain cancer rates you have to look at the types of brain tumors that have become predominant and the groups in which they occur In more recent years we have in fact seen a statistically significant uptick in brain cancer in younger people and children We ve also seen an increase in tumors situated near the ear on the side people hold their phones Most people breach the safety limits of their cellphones Also noted in the featured video anytime you carry your phone on your body and it is not in airplane mode you are breaching the safety limits of your phone This safety limit known as the specific absorption rate SAR is typically buried in the legal section of your phone but will state that you need to keep the phone at a specified distance from your body to prevent overexposure and potential heat damage Demasi s cellphone specified a safety limit of 10 millimeters meaning she would need to keep it at least 1 centimeter from her body at all times So it s important to realize that your cellphone no longer complies with safety regulations once it s placed in your pocket or bra It s also worth noting that the Federal Communications Commission bases its thermal safety standards on a model that does not apply to the population at large especially not children The standards are based on a model called standard anthropomorphic man a model much larger than the average person The larger the body the shallower the penetration of the radiation so SAR levels are likely too generous for most people The experts interviewed believe it s safe to say that most people breach the SAR

damage is not caused by heating In reality there s no such thing as a safe cellphone as they all emit EMFs The only way to make it safe is to turn it off or keep it in airplane mode which suspends RF signal transmissions Pall calculates that the safety standards based on thermal damage not molecular biology are off by a factor of 7 million Also noted in the video is that safety standards are based on the decades old and now debunked theory that no damage can occur unless the tissue is heated but mounting evidence strongly suggests this simply isn t true and a number of different mechanisms of harm have been presented in the scientific literature Two crucial ways EMFs harm your health There s even evidence suggesting that radiation affects your microbiome turning what might otherwise be beneficial microbes pathogenic This too can have far ranging health effects since we now know your microbiome plays an important role in health Importantly while the mechanisms may differ the end result is often the same In short EMFs Increase oxidative stress which can damage cell membranes and proteins and break DNA bonds Decrease ATP the energy currency in your body without which your cells cannot function properly Protecting Yourself and Your Children From Excessive EMF As of September 2018 France will impose a complete ban on cellphone use by primary and secondary school students during school hours Students will not be permitted to use their phones even during breaks lunch or between classes California also issued consumer guidance on how to lower cellphone radiation exposure after initially trying to cover up the hazards Russia has also implemented laws to minimize Wi Fi exposure in schools and countries like Switzerland Italy Austria Luxembourg Bulgaria Poland Hungary Israel and China have RF exposure limits that are up to 10 000 times lower than the U S In my mind EMF exposure is unquestionably a significant health hazard that needs to be addressed if you re

lesson the Wi Fi is turned off If you have Wi Fi in your home I would recommend implementing a similar strategy at home Helpful strategies to reduce your EMF exposure Here are several other suggestions that will also help reduce your EMF exposure Connect your desktop computer to the internet via a wired Ethernet connection and be sure to put your desktop in airplane mode Also avoid wireless keyboards trackballs mice game systems printers and portable house phones and opt for wired versions If you must use Wi Fi shut it off when not in use especially at night when you are sleeping Ideally work toward hardwiring your house so you can eliminate Wi Fi altogether If you have a notebook without any Ethernet ports a USB Ethernet adapter will allow you to connect to the internet with a wired connection Shut off the electricity to your bedroom at night This typically works to reduce electrical fields from the wires in your wall unless there is an adjoining room next to your bedroom If that is the case use an EMF meter to determine if you also need to power down the adjacent room Use a battery powered alarm clock ideally one without any light I use a talking clock for the visually impaired If you still use a microwave oven consider replacing it with a steam convection oven which will heat your food as quickly and far more safely Avoid using smart appliances and thermostats that depend on wireless signaling This would include all new smart TVs They are called smart because they emit a Wi Fi signal and unlike your computer you cannot shut the Wi Fi signal off Consider using a large computer monitor as your TV instead as they don t emit Wi Fi Refuse smart meters as long as you can or add a shield to an existing smart meter some of which have been shown to reduce radiation by 98 to 99 Consider moving your baby s bed into your bedroom instead of using a wireless baby monitor Alternatively use a hard wired monitor Replace compact fluorescent light bulbs

according to a new peer reviewed paper by Children s Health Defense CHD researchers The Pharmacovigilance Betrayal of the COVID 19 Era was published May 30 in Medical Research Archives the official journal of The European Society of Medicine Brian Hooker Ph D CHD s chief scientific officer Karl Jablonowski Ph D CHD s senior research scientist and CHD staff attorney Risa Evans co authored the paper The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC failed to perform effective pharmacovigilance of the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines according to the paper The FDA and CDC fell short in their obligation to surveil pharmaceutical harms betraying their core obligations and the American people the paper stated The FDA and CDC also tried to sidestep CHD s Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests filed in 2022 The FOIA requests sought records on how the agencies discussed and investigated safety signals However the agencies have yet to produce such records and the lawsuits seeking the records are currently stayed Evans said In 2023 CHD separately sued the FDA and the CDC to obtain the records Commenting on the paper s publication Jablonowski said This is a paper that had to be written The more time that passes the more people will forget and forgetting is the recipe for repeating Pharmacovigilance is the public s last defense against vaccine injury Without an adequate system we are flying blind on vaccine safety If we cannot monitor the safety of injections we shouldn t be injecting The paper was published a week after the Make America Healthy Again MAHA Commission released its 100 day report The report identified factors including vaccines and problems with vaccine safety monitoring that may contribute to the chronic disease epidemic in the U S Pharmacovigilance behind closed doors should give everyone pause The new paper specifically focuses on the failure of the FDA and CDC to monitor vaccine safety data from

usually involve a few hundred or few thousand participants and are orchestrated by the pharmaceutical company that stands to profit According to the paper By the time it is approved by the FDA if a bad reaction is uncommon we re not going to see it in a few thousand person study but like how not every single cigarette causes cancer the dangers are still real In essence the clinical trial never ends it s just that our children become the subjects of the uncontrolled experiment VAERS a passive surveillance system that vaccine injury victims or their physicians can submit reports to contains 1 6 million reports for the COVID 19 vaccines the paper states According to Albert Benavides a VAERS expert and founder of VAERSAware com As of today COVID 19 vaccines account for 78 of all deaths in VAERS By 2022 VAERS data showed that the COVID 19 vaccines were associated with more injuries and deaths than all conventional vaccines combined in the previous three decades Although the FDA and CDC promised to study VAERS in a manner that would help determine which of these reported adverse events were caused by the shots information CHD obtained through legal actions indicates that those agencies failed to keep that crucial promise The FDA and CDC which co administer VAERS are required to use distinctly different data mining methods to identify safety signals in the database and to collaborate to investigate any detected signals to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the safety signal and the vaccine in question However information CHD obtained through its FOIA requests showed that the FDA and CDC did not fulfill this obligation for the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines When CHD peeked behind closed doors we did not find vigilance at work the paper stated Instead

detected through either method of data mining the FDA and CDC promised to investigate whether the adverse events associated with the signals were caused by the shots FDA records obtained by CHD collected over 18 months showed that while the agency identified consistent alerts for serious adverse events including deaths for the Janssen Johnson Johnson COVID 19 vaccine it identified almost no safety signals for the Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech mRNA products There were no alerts for widely recognized adverse events such as myocarditis pericarditis or anaphylaxis the paper stated Instead the records listed only 3 clinically relevant signals for the mRNA platform a rash exposure via breast milk and drug ineffectiveness The data collected by the CDC during the four months it analyzed data using the PRR method returned 743 clinical safety signals including death stroke heavy menstrual bleeding and myocarditis According to Jablonowski the FDA and CDC may have turned a blind eye to safety signals because of conflicts of interest Proper pharmacovigilance would have slammed the brakes on the rollout at the first signs of myocarditis in young men Jablonowski said It is a foregone conclusion that the royalties collected by the National Institutes of Health 400 million from Moderna and 750 million Pfizer BioNTech would have been less had the FDA and CDC protected America The extent to which the Agencies have investigated these signals is still unknown the paper stated Pharmacovigilance behind closed doors should give everyone pause It is simply too important to not do

VSD is not publicly available and is geared towards studying short term outcomes instead of links between vaccines and longer term chronic disease According to Evans instead of investigating safety

to the same kids during the year before the lockdowns according to a new peer reviewed study Myopia or nearsightedness is growing more common among children according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology Though estimates vary nearly half of the world s population is expected to have myopia by 2050 The study authors who published their findings on Nov 18 in the British Journal of

lockdowns with the differences in exam results from 2020 to 2021 when COVID 19 lockdowns were in effect Through statistical analyses they found a substantial worsening of myopia progression during the period of home confinement and online learning during the COVID 19 pandemic Specifically the change in myopia progression rates from 2020 to 2021 was more than double 2 2 times greater the change from 2019 to 2020 The greatest increase in myopia prevalence was seen in younger elementary school aged children particularly in 8 year olds and also in 17 year olds they said The authors said their findings align with prior research showing that kids who spend lots of time indoors reading and looking at screens tend to have worsening eyesight They also cited prior research showing that spending time outdoors typically prevents and mitigates myopia The researchers concluded that COVID 19 pandemic policies including school closures and cancellation of outdoor group sports likely played a role in the uptick in myopia progression Online learning methods and increased screen time and less outdoor time have persisted despite the end of COVID 19 lockdowns they said Their evidence suggests that may be a problem when it comes to kids eye health The authors of the study called for a reduction in kids online learning because of its associated screen time and lack of outdoor activity 8 year olds

and adolescents too They also called for more research on the long term impact of increased screen time and decreased outdoor activities on kids vision The study authors noted a limitation of the study is that it lacked exact measurements of screen time hours and outdoor activity hours Instead the authors used the timeline of official education guidelines to infer the extent to which kids

Investigates 33 Deaths Germany Probes 10 Deaths Norway upped the number of deaths under investigation from 23 last week to 33 while in Germany health officials said they are investigating 10 deaths that occurred among elderly patients who received the COVID vaccine China health experts say Norway and other countries should suspend the use of mRNA vaccines like those produced by Pfizer and Moderna especially among the elderly according to Global Times Norway health officials said last week they were investigating the deaths of 23 elderly people who died shortly after receiving the vaccine and had confirmed 13 of those were directly related to the vaccine Today Bloomberg reported that the number of deaths under investigation in Norway had risen to 33 and that all had occurred in people ranging from age 75 to 80 According to Bloomberg Camilla Stoltenberg head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said at a press conference today It is important to remember that about 45 people die every day in nursing homes in Norway so it is not a given that this represents any excess mortality or that there is a causal connection The Norwegian Medicines Agency previously told Bloomberg that all of the deaths occurred in people who received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine which until Friday was the only COVID vaccine approved for use in Norway The Norwegian Institute of Public Health which had originally prioritized the elderly for the vaccine has since revised its advice to urge more caution when vaccinating the elderly especially those with underlying conditions The institute told Bloomberg that for those with the most severe frailty even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant The Institute also admitted to Global Times that the clinical trials that resulted in emergency approval of the vaccine included very few people over the age of 85 but added we assume that the side effects will largely be the same in the elderly as in those over 65 years of age According to the Global Times a Beijing based immunologist who requested anonymity said the mRNA vaccines had not proven safe for large scale use or for preventing infectious diseases Noting that people over 80 have weaker immune systems he said they should not receive the vaccine but instead should take medicines to improve their immune systems Meanwhile The BMJ and other news outlets reported last week that in Germany the Paul Ehrlich Institute is investigating 10 deaths in people ranging in age from 79 to 93 who died shortly after receiving the COVID vaccine U S health officials continue to push COVID vaccinations in nursing homes despite growing resistance among nursing home employees to take the vaccine", "chunk_id":

in upstate New York vaccinated 193 residents beginning on Dec 22 and subsequently reported 24 deaths within the span of a couple of weeks The facility attributed the deaths to a COVID 19 outbreak even though there had been no COVID 19 deaths in any nursing homes in the entire county until the first three deaths were reported Dec 29 Florida health officials and the U S Centers for Disease Control

was a medical certainty that the death was related to Pfizer s vaccine The U S Food and Drug Administration is investigating numerous severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in healthcare workers who received the vaccine Sunday night California health officials called for a pause on the use of a huge batch of Moderna s COVID vaccine due to its higher than usual number of possible

role in orchestrating news and editorial coverage in America s most influential liberal national media outlets and its continued hold today As a longtime investigative journalist and author I have spent a good portion of my career researching corruption within U S intelligence agencies I was nevertheless surprised to learn about the Central Intelligence Agency s CIA central role in crafting the militarized governmental response to the COVID 19 pandemic which Robert F Kennedy Jr documents in the final chapters of his new runaway best seller The Real Anthony Fauci I ve known Kennedy for more than two decades I have interviewed him and collaborated with him on environmental articles and several books including Climate In Crisis I have great respect for his legal work and the accomplishments of his ongoing Waterkeeper Alliance And I appreciate his dedication to alerting the public about alternative narratives related to the pandemic I am fully vaccinated and a believer in the efficacy of the vaccines However as a bedrock liberal with a deep reverence for the First Amendment and time honored right to freedom of speech I became alarmed that social media sites including Instagram and YouTube have banned Kennedy from pointing out flaws in the dominant narratives surrounding the COVID crisis In my view Kennedy has been falsely vilified as an anti vaccination disinformation conspiracy theorist Blanket censorship by mainstream media seems to prohibit him from responding to such attacks And it disturbs me that once idealistic liberal media outlets have devolved into apologists for the pharmaceutical industry including its captured public health technocrats as well as their stifling of any dissent Why the vitriol against Kennedy I wondered from leading liberal news websites such as Daily Kos The Daily Beast and more recently Rolling Stone A The Daily Beast headline appearing one year before the pandemic set the tone Feb 8 2019 Robert F Kennedy Jr spouts his insane anti vaxxer conspiracy theory in measles hot zone Seeming to borrow a page from the CIA s propaganda manuals the liberal blogs have employed the signature trope of

Stunt In lockstep Daily Kos headlined a story by one of its regular contributors DowneastDem Anti Vaxxer RFK JR joins neo Nazis in massive Berlin Anti Corona Protest Kennedy fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit against Daily Kos and its pseudonymous author In fact the Berlin Peace and Justice Rally had been attended by a million peaceful Europeans of every ethnicity protesting what they saw as the global imposition of totalitarian controls and seeking restoration of democracy tolerance the stage banner was a giant mural of Mahatma Gandhi and the MC was a Black Ghanaian constitutional guarantees and civil rights the opposite of Nazism The enmity against Kennedy has only escalated as his prominence in the resistance has grown His quackery has likely killed people Daily Kos went so far as to assert Another posting read He s a twisted sick individual who has made a mockery of his family s legacy His own family has distanced itself calling him dangerous as if he has the plague because he likely does Maybe even more than one plague He is indeed against all vaccinations Anyone who has followed Kennedy s nuanced measured and well informed views on the science might recognize such sophomoric characterizations as disinformation propaganda Yet the liberal metamorphosis appears so complete that Public Citizen an advocacy group that once served as a scourge to Big Pharma is using its tax deductible legal assets to defend Daily Kos pro bono against Kennedy s lawsuit Daily Kos support of censoring debate about the government s COVID countermeasures belies Public Citizen s rationale that its passion for defending the First Amendment prompted its decision to defend Daily Kos So how did the Pharma cartel capture the liberal media The abduction has been multifaceted In his new book Kennedy shows how Pharma s deployment of 9 6 billion in annual advertising expenditures allows it to dictate content in electronic and print outlets transforming the traditionally liberal networks ABC NBC CBS and CNN into marketing and propaganda vehicles With 319 million in strategic donations Bill Gates simultaneously gained control of so called independent media outlets like NPR

It wasn t a civil war it was a massacre Dodd is currently the director of the Dodd Center for Human Rights at the University of Connecticut Moulitsas father evidently took the side of the oligarchs and the Agency The younger Markos later reflected on his experience I actually grew up in a war zone I witnessed communist guerillas execute students accused of being government collaborators I was 8 years old and I remember stepping over a dead body warm blood flowing from a fresh wound Dodging bullets while at market I lived in the midst of hate the likes of which most of you will never understand There s no way I could ever describe the ways this experience colors my worldview When rebel fighters appropriated the Moulitsas home for their headquarters Markos says his parents received

17 spending his service as an artillery scout for a missile unit in a small German town and dodging deployment to the Gulf War by a hair He later reflected that I would not be the person I am today without my military service During a confessional moment at San Francisco s Commonwealth Club in 2006 Moulitsas acknowledged that at some point following his discharge he enlisted in the CIA entering the agency s rigorous training program hoping to become an undercover spy So I applied to the CIA and I went all the way to the end I mean it was to the point where I was going to sign papers to

of course have ended up back in his despised Washington D C Before Dean s political nosedive early in 2004 Moulitsas moved west to Silicon Valley at a time when the CIA was storming the Internet There as project manager in a web development start up he met and married Elisa Batista a reporter for Wired As Kennedy shows in his book Wired served as an external newsletter for the U S intelligence

no weapons of mass destruction This of course was classic disinformation In fact the CIA in 2003 was as usual aggressively pushing for war The agency played a direct and reprehensible role in fabricating intelligence to grease the skids for President Bush s Iraq invasion During the run up to the attack CIA Director George Tenet famously assured President Bush that Saddam had a secret arsenal of weapons of mass destruction He said Don t worry it s a slam dunk George W Bush later said his worst mistake during his White House years was swallowing the CIA s guarantees He said The biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said the weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein Apparently assuming the illiteracy of his Commonwealth Club audience Moulitsas went on to describe the CIA as a very liberal institution He said And in a lot of ways it really does

broadcast propaganda to Americans When a congressional investigation in the mid 1970s first revealed Operation Mockingbird s existence shocked Americans learned that the agency s key CIA collaborators included Washington Post owner Philip Graham CBS owner William Paley Time Life publisher Henry Luce top editors at the New York Times and Joseph Alsop whose influential column appeared in more than 300 newspapers CIA Director Allen Dulles oversaw Mockingbird s illegal network until RFK Jr s uncle President John Kennedy fired him at the end of 1961 By then Mockingbird was employing some 3 000 salaried and contract CIA employees engaged in propaganda efforts The agency commissioned its journalists to write articles promoting the expansion of the military industrial complex and the national security state and rewarded them with classified information to spice up their scoops The CIA also established formal journalism training for its spies embedding them in key journals and nurturing their careers The agency promoted propaganda narratives including portraying murdered Salvadoran farmers as Communists under Soviet control and discouraged newspapers from delving into CIA atrocities such as the agency s mass murders of tens of thousands of Vietnamese peasants Buddhist leaders and intellectuals Operation Phoenix its orchestration of the butchering of a million Indonesian civilians

referendum to fluoridate the city s drinking water was passed in 2000 We would return to this practice as originally directed by the voters Hanna said Most residents of New York town were in favor of ending fluoridation Two New York towns Yorktown and Somers also stopped fluoridating their local water supply following the federal court s decision According to Patch Yorktown Supervisor Ed

a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Scientists and legal experts have petitioned the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to suspend or withdraw the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID 19 vaccines arguing they are unapproved gene therapies and citing their contamination with DNA plasmids According to a press release by Australian law firm PJ O Brien Associates the petition exposes alarming evidence of synthetic DNA contamination and regulatory failures that could affect millions worldwide shedding light on a public health crisis The Citizen Petition stated that Pfizer and Moderna misclassified their mRNA products as vaccines instead of gene therapy products enabling the companies to avoid legally required FDA environmental assessments This misclassification denied Americans transparency and informed consent violating federal law and rendering approvals void from the start the press release stated The petition also cites several studies that confirm synthetic DNA in these vaccines at levels 6 to 470 times above safety thresholds This biologically active DNA detected in vials and human blood carries SV40 simian virus 40 sequences linked to cancer and genomic instability posing risks of oncogenesis hereditary changes and immune disruption the press release stated The petition calls on the FDA to investigate its classification of the mRNA shots as non gene therapy products conduct independent testing of existing COVID 19 vaccine stocks issue public guidance on contamination related risks and conduct studies examining the vaccines contamination and their health effects Vetted by U S attorneys and hailed by MAHA Make America Healthy Again advisors for its rigor this document is a clarion call to rewrite the narrative on COVID 19 vaccine safety the press release stated The petition is open for public comment Initial signatories include In 2023 McKernan became the first scientist to identify DNA contaminants in the mRNA shots This is not just an American crisis it s a global reckoning According to the press release the petition to the FDA falls under the purview of Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr HHS oversees the FDA Kennedy has until July 20 to issue a ruling on the petition The petition was also submitted to the U S Department of Justice asking the agency to consider potential fraud indictments against Pfizer and Moderna It was also shared with the U S Department of Government Efficiency s FDA initiative This is not just an American crisis it s a global reckoning Gillespie said in the petition The

regain the public s trust McKernan asked They recently recalled some protein bars for a threat of peanut allergies yet every American knows multiple people with COVID 19 vaccine injuries yet the FDA is head in the sand silent The FDA and HHS did not respond to requests for comment by press time Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us COVID shots were unlawfully licensed The petition cites federal regulations that require all gene therapy products under FDA consideration to include an Environmental Assessment or a claim of categorical exclusion Under the regulation the human environment including human health and safety is part of such an environmental assessment Instead of classifying their mRNA COVID 19 shots as gene therapies the petition stated Pfizer and Moderna sought categorical exclusions which the FDA wrongfully and illegally granted despite clear legal and regulatory provisions showing ineligibility for such exclusions The petition notes that the FDA defines gene therapy products as those that intend to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use Rose said gene therapy products are different from conventional vaccines A conventional vaccine uses weakened or inactivated material to trigger an immune response while a nucleoside modified RNA gene based product uses a small piece of modified genetic material spike gene to instruct cells to produce a protein that stimulates immunity According to the press release Had the FDA properly demanded Environmental Assessments the American public would have been informed of the gene therapy nature of the mRNA vaccines fulfilling legal obligations for transparency and enabling informed consent Without

Advertising strategy more than misleading and irresponsible it s unethical Each class action challenges similar practices by the major manufacturers although the practices vary depending on the type and brand of product The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the American Dental Association ADA the American Academy of Pediatrics and others recommend that children under age 3 should use no more than a smear of fluoride toothpaste and children ages 3 to 6 should use no more than a pea sized amount Two of the complaints allege Procter Gamble maker of Crest Kids and Colgate Palmolive maker of Colgate and Tom s of Maine understand that encouraging caregivers to use the safe recommended amount of toothpaste is bad for their bottom line As a result they use misleading and aggressive tactics to prompt parents to use far more than is safe a practice researchers have long linked to toothpaste overconsumption by children For example both companies packaging and websites show images of a toothbrush with a full strip of toothpaste The lawsuit alleges the image implies a full strip is the recommended quantity However it is eight to 10 times more than the recommended amount for a child under 3 and three to four times the recommended amount for a child ages 3 6 Colgate uses pictures of fruit with matching flavors and names like Watermelon Burst which sounds like a candy product

right the distrust of government institutions and the rise of disinformation Among the three quarters polled who said the COVID 19 pandemic took a toll on their lives 27 said the toll was major and 47 said it was a minor toll While more than one million Americans have died from COVID 19 in the past 5 years and millions more live with long COVID only one in five adults 21 now say the coronavirus is a major threat to the health of the U S population as a whole A majority 56 said the virus is no longer something they need to worry about much as most Americans have been infected with the virus many multiple times When examining poll results through political party affiliations 60 of Republicans said COVID 19 is no worse than a cold or flu but 76 of Democrats describe COVID 19 today as worse than a cold or flu Carnegie Mellon to Pay Students 4 8m for Shifting to Remote Classes During COVID Insurance Journal reported Carnegie Mellon University has agreed to pay 4 8 million to settle a class

students in the settlement class The Carnegie Mellon University CMU students class action was filed May 15 2020 The students claimed that that they were entitled to refunds of tuition fees and other charges because beginning in March 2020 CMU provided classes remotely in response to the COVID 19 pandemic The class action maintained that students who paid tuition and fees for the Spring 2020 semester had an implied contract with CMU that entitled them to in person instruction and that by switching to remote education in response to the pandemic CMU breached that implied contract The

COVID It s Boosting Social Security to the Tune of 205 Billion Fortune reported As the U S approaches the fifth anniversary of the official start of the COVID 19 pandemic new research finds so many Americans died from the virus that the nation s Social Security trust fund will see a net increase of hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of retirement benefits that will not be paid out The working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that approximately 1 7 million excess deaths among Americans 25 and older occurred between 2020 and 2023 related to the pandemic Premature deaths related to COVID 19 mean Social Security will not make retirement payments to those individuals in the future reducing payments by about 294 billion the researchers found At the same time some of that gain is offset by the lost tax revenue from those individuals as well as increased survivor benefits to spouses and children of the deceased resulting in an estimated 205 billion

Effect on Dental Health Adding fluoride to drinking water provides very limited dental benefits according to an updated Cochrane Review published today The review follows a California federal court ruling that fluoridation poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Adding fluoride to drinking water provides very limited dental benefits especially compared with 50 years ago according to an updated Cochrane Review published today The review follows less than two weeks after a California federal judge ruled water fluoridation poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children and must be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA It also comes as some U S cities and towns have moved to pause or stop fluoridating their water in response to the verdict signaling that fluoridating water a long term and largely unquestioned practice in the U S is facing heightened scrutiny To determine if water fluoridation leads to reduced rates of tooth decay researchers from the University of Manchester and other U K universities reviewed 157 studies comparing communities that fluoridated their water to those that don t They concluded that contemporary evidence shows community water fluoridation may lead to a very small reduction in cavities in children s baby teeth over time Fluoride in water reduced tooth decay only by about one quarter of one tooth they found and even that conclusion was made with low certainty Adding fluoride to water may slightly increase the number of children who have no tooth decay in either their baby teeth or permanent teeth the study authors wrote However these results also included the possibility of little or no difference in tooth decay They said studies conducted in 1975 or before showed a larger benefit of water fluoridation on tooth decay CNN reported a reduction of about one less cavity in baby teeth However those findings no longer apply to populations today who have better baseline dental health and exposure to other sources of fluoride like toothpaste they said The findings also confirm recent observational studies including the LOTUS Study which found only a 2 reduction in cavities among people living in fluoridated areas in England The conclusions taken together with recent scientific research and the federal court decision raise serious questions about the practice of community water fluoridation When interpreting the evidence it is important to think about the wider context and how society and health have changed over

water fluoridation is a safe and effective strategy for oral health I find it incredibly irresponsible that agencies like the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have lauded and promoted this harmful practice of fluoridation for far too long integrative dentist Dr Griffin Cole told The Defender Cole said that given the known neurotoxic effects of fluoride there was never any justification for fluoridating water He said It is accurate to say we are all exposed to so many other sources of fluoride that continuing to add it to our water supply is now not necessary but it s disingenuous and unconscionable to say the statistically insignificant effect on tooth decay was worth poisoning millions of Americans and children s brains for nearly 80 years In last week s 80 page federal court decision U S District Judge Edward Chen evaluated and summarized the extensive scientific data presented at trial demonstrating that fluoride has neurotoxic effects on the developing brains of fetuses and children According to Chen the optimal level of water fluoridation currently used in the U S which is 0 7 milligrams per liter is too close to the known level at which fluoride poses a neurotoxic risk and may itself be neurotoxic Research published in JAMA Network Open in May shows that children born to

his home in Florida taking a gap year before beginning college in Arizona when the COVID 19 pandemic lockdowns went into effect and ended his internship Like many American families Cody and his family took the recommended precautions around COVID 19 But when the vaccines became available his parents were skeptical Cody told The Defender in an interview As he began planning for college and started a short term job at a coffee shop where everyone was vaccinated Cody started researching the vaccine online and talking to people around him He concluded the vaccine made sense based on the available information His mother Heather Hudson told The Defender she didn t want Cody to get vaccinated but she had trouble finding convincing scientific information to convince him of the dangers We would go on my computer and try to research and even myocarditis information wasn t coming up Heather said The warnings that should have been there were censored from us Cody s employer didn t require him to get the vaccine he said but he was heavily encouraged to get it and concerned about keeping his job He also was concerned about being able to stay in school There was virtually no getting into college without having a vaccine and having the paperwork to go with it he said It was a stressful situation Two months after second Pfizer shot he was coughing up blood In July 2021 Cody got two doses of the Pfizer vaccine He had flu like symptoms following the first dose About a week or two after the second shot he began to get a rash on his arms At first Cody said I thought it was eczema which I d had in the past It kept coming and going I thought it was probably from being exposed to more chemicals from hand sanitizers so my instinct was to just try to take care of my skin the way I had been instructed to in the past He used hypoallergenic soaps and got some sample creams from his dermatologist Soon Cody began having aches and pains in his body including severe knee pain He chalked it up

his situation began to deteriorate rapidly according to Heather As a mom I know he was kind of hiding it from me but he was clearly having aches and pains and his knee was hurting worse she said The skin condition was to me looking like something severe And so I was encouraging him to go to the hospital but he was afraid to go Cody said he didn t think anything really wrong until I coughed up blood One night after his regular run he wasn t feeling well and he went to sleep At three in the morning Heather said he was coughing up blood and hanging onto the walls trying to stand up and his face was swelling I couldn t lie down because it was so painful Cody said I felt like I was going to die from the pain I don t know how to describe it He went to the emergency room where they diagnosed him with a pulmonary embolism in his left lung and numerous small blood clots or thrombosis in his right lung He also had thrombocytopenia throughout his lungs The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS shows between Dec 14 2020 and Sept 22 2023 48 645 reports of blood clotting disorders have been submitted Of those 33 532 reports were attributed to Pfizer They gave him three days to live Cody s condition was particularly challenging to treat because you are dealing with bleeding and clotting at the same time it s very confusing Heather said They gave him three days to live she said Cody said the doctors kept blaming the event on COVID 19 or COVID pneumonia even though he had never had COVID 19 and all of the tests

son After just a few days in the hospital Cody was sent home with no support despite the fact he was clearly suffering from a life threatening illness Heather said They got a hospital bed for their house and tended to him in the living room I had to stay on an incline so I could breathe Cody said I couldn t walk Cody s oxygen levels began to crash and he was soon back in the emergency hospital Once again they discharged him quickly He turned 22 in the hospital Heather said A 22 year old kid who was a runner who was very fit with thrombocytopenia thrombosis no COVID no pneumonia and the hospital was releasing him again And it just seemed surreal to me For the next several months Cody was in and out of urgent care and the emergency room They found steroids helped him and so they kept seeking them out It took five horrible months of just trying to keep Cody alive Heather said before they found a doctor who would help them She learned about a Florida doctor Dr Eduardo Balbona who was helping patients who couldn t recover from COVID 19 using the typical hospital protocols I called Dr Balbona Heather said and the rest is history Balbona hadn t treated a vaccine injured patient before Cody but he ran a series of tests and diagnosed him with new onset antiphospholipid syndrome an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that react against normal proteins in the blood causing increased blood clotting Balbona told the Hudsons that Cody s autoimmune reaction was due to the lipids in the mRNA vaccine He put Cody on hydroxychloroquine

Cody s Law if passed could pose a financial burden to Florida state healthcare programs Heather Hudson told The Defender she believes those statements are inaccurate because Cody s Law proposes to

lawmakers are considering a bill that would expedite the review and payment process for vaccine injury claims under the Medicare Medicaid and Medicaid Medically Needy Programs If passed Cody s Law Florida No Vaccine Injured Patient Left Behind would be the first such law in the U S and could supplant federal vaccine injury compensation programs The bill filed in the Florida House of

standard continues in Connecticut regardless of whatever political decisions are made at the federal level Lamont said Previous state law mandated that water be fluoridated at levels recommended by HHS Currently the agency recommends 0 7 milligrams per liter but it may reexamine that recommendation The law mandates that the amount of fluoride that must be added to the state s water supply remains at the HHS recommended level of 0 7 milligrams per liter Pro fluoridation lobbyists including the American Dental Association ADA and state dental associations celebrated the news The ADA said it was pleased that Connecticut has taken a proactive approach to protecting community water fluoridation The Fluoride Action Network FAN which educates the public about the dangers of fluoridation

fluoride Water fluoridation hasn t always been a partisan issue In the early 2010s Democratic cities such as Portland Oregon and Santa Fe New Mexico voted to end water fluoridation over concerns about the chemical s toxic effects However the issue became more politicized in November 2024 after Robert F Kennedy Jr a longtime fluoride critic said the incoming Trump administration would advise local water systems to stop fluoridating water Kennedy was confirmed as HHS secretary in February Since then Democratic politicians and the mainstream press have vocally supported water fluoridation and attacked critics including even CNN and Washington Post health commentator Dr Leana Wen However the Trump administration has given mixed signals on its approach to water fluoridation In April EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to expeditiously review new science on the possible health risks of water fluoridation Also that month Kennedy said he planned to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending water fluoridation nationally However that recommendation has not happened Instead last week Michael Connett attorney for the plaintiffs in the landmark fluoride lawsuit announced on X that the EPA plans to appeal Chen s decision ordering the agency to address the risks of water fluoridation The agency is expected to file its appeal later this week In 2015 President Barack Obama s Surgeon General Vivek Murthy officially lowered the recommended dosage for water fluoridation from 0 7 1 2 milligrams per liter to 0 7 milligrams per liter after

then go to cover healthcare for people with chronic diseases The proposed reforms have gained popular support particularly from conservatives who tend to favor cuts to welfare programs according to Substack writer Will Sommer But shortly after Kennedy publicly made his case several high profile conservative accounts began criticizing the reforms denouncing Kennedy s war on soda According to

Suit first pointed out the similarities on X Then Turning Point USA s Riley Gaines posted that she was offered money to make similar posts but declined Reporter Nick Sortor was the first to reveal that the public relations firm Influenceable was behind the posts It had reportedly paid influencers up to 1 000 per post to oppose the SNAP reforms Sorter found messages that included templates provided by Influenceable to influencers in what he said was an attempt to turn MAGA folks against RFK Jr and MAHA Make America Healthy Again After Sorter outed the influencers on X Daugherty confirmed the allegations posting on X Yeah that was dumb of me Massive egg on my face In all seriousness it won t happen again Sorter also said this was a playbook often used by soda industry lobbying firms like American Beverage and Cart Choice This led some people to mistakenly report that American Beverage was behind the scheme which the firm denies American Beverage was caught in 2023 paying off dieticians to promote sugar and aspartame to kids on Instagram Fang similarly noted this tactic revealed a longstanding pattern in the beverage industry s approach to policy debates over sugary drinks For example the industry has funded scientists to persuade people to focus on exercise instead of calorie intake for weight loss strategies When San Francisco proposed taxes on sweetened beverages Big Soda paid protestors to attend anti tax rallies and argue the tax would disproportionately harm minority communities Fang wrote This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today The industry used similar tactics in New York where Coca Cola funded the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation which then promoted similar arguments when the city proposed a soda tax Fang also reported that the industry targets organizations focused on children s health For example Coca Cola has given nearly 3 million to the American Academy of Pediatrics over six years and the organization stayed silent during contentious policy debates over sugary drinks Save the Children which supported a soda tax in the past changed its position when it sought grants from soda producers including 5 million from PepsiCo

Insider to save this article Sign Up By Shannon Kelleher In the waning days of the Biden administration a long fought battle over a cancer causing food additive is again in the spotlight as consumer advocacy groups and lawmakers demand federal regulators ban red dye No 3 a chemical used to give popular candies foods and drinks their cherry red colors The issue took center stage on Dec 5 at a U S Senate hearing where lawmakers grilled Jim Jones U S Food and Drug Administration FDA deputy commissioner for human foods over the issue Red 3 has been known to cause cancer in cosmetics but we still allow it to be put in our food I don t understand that Sen Tommy Tuberville R Ala said in the hearing If we know something is deadly for anybody that ingests it how do we continue to just study that and not say hey enough is enough Industry studies linked red dye No 3 to cancer in rodents more than 30 years ago and public health groups have spent years lobbying food companies and regulators to get the chemical out of foods Two years ago two dozen organizations and scientists submitted a petition to the FDA demanding a ban citing a 1990 FDA conclusion that the chemical causes cancer when fed to rats Last month 23 members of Congress sent a letter to the FDA also calling for a ban saying the FDA should act quickly to protect the nation s youth from this harmful dye The letter noted red dye No 3 has been banned or mostly banned in Europe Australia and New Zealand and California has a ban on the dye in food taking effect in 2027 Thirty four years of inaction is far too long the letter states In the Dec 5 hearing Jones said the agency was hopeful it would be acting on that petition in the next few weeks It is long past time for the FDA to ban the dye U S Rep Frank Pallone D N J said in a Dec 5 letter to the FDA With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are

warning labels on them they use the precautionary principle which says if there is any question about the safety they don t go into the food supply Marion Nestle said on CNN on Dec 6 We do it the opposite way We put them in the food supply and then wait to see if people get sick The FDA s inaction on red dye No 3 embodies a broader agency problem with the FDA taking a very lax approach to regulating food additives said Thomas Galligan principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest one of the groups that petitioned the FDA in 2022 Basically once chemicals are in the food system they can stay there for as long as companies want because the FDA is not taking action when new evidence of harm emerges said Galligan While the petition currently sits with the White House Office of Management and Budget the FDA can grant the petition on its own without the office s approval said Melanie Benesh vice president of Government Affairs for the Environmental Working Group EWG one of the groups backing the 2022 petition This would be an easy action for the Biden Administration to take to get a cancer causing chemical out of food said Benesh Industry pushback Red dye No 3 is found in staple holiday candies such as Halloween candy corn and Valentine s Day conversation hearts as well as over 2 800 other food products in EWG s Food Scores database ranging from childhood favorites like Fruit by the Foot and Dubble Bubble chewing Gum as well as certain brands of mashed potatoes yellow rice and some medications In 2021 food and drug manufacturers used about 200 000 pounds of red dye No 3 in their products In 1990 the FDA banned red dye No 3 from use in cosmetics such as lipsticks as well as externally applied drugs

rats are species specific and that authoritative scientific bodies and many world renowned toxicologists over many decades have concluded that the findings of thyroid carcinogenesis in male rats is not relevant to humans The groups requested that the FDA conduct a scientific review of research to determine the safety of red dye No 3 and decide to maintain Red No 3 in the permanent list of color additives Mounting pressure In 2021 the California Environmental Protection Agency s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment released a report that concluded synthetic food dyes such as red dye No 3 have been linked to inattentiveness hyperactivity and restlessness in some children with federal consumption levels for these chemicals failing to account for recent research The report also found that children are often exposed to levels of red dye No 3 that exceed the FDA s Acceptable Daily Intake Level Following the report state lawmakers passed the California Food Safety Act or so called Skittles Bill which will ban the manufacture and sale of red dye No 3 as well as three other food additives statewide beginning Jan 1 2027 In August the state passed the California School Food Safety Act which will ban six food dyes linked to childhood learning problems from meals served at California public schools beginning Dec 21 2027 Following California s lead nine other states are currently working on legislation that would ban red dye No 3 with Pennsylvania proposing a ban on five other food additives as well And a spokesperson for Abbott Laboratories the company that makes the children s nutrition shake PediaSure said it removed red dye No 3 from the drink in 2024 and will remove the additive from other products next year But while actions by California and other states are good news for consumers it shouldn t have to come to basically voluntary action and state action to get this type of chemical out of our food said Galligan By making Red Dye 3 federally illegal it

the petition to ban red dye No 3 does fail to pass under the Biden administration it should still be acted upon by the Trump administration said Jensen Jose regulatory council for the Center for Science in the Public Interest The potential for budget cuts to the already budget strapped FDA looms however under an administration already touting plans for 500 billion cuts in government spending Jose said Unfortunately when cuts are made some of the first things to go are the budgets to the food programs Jose If this is not on their radar and they re just making massive cuts then yeah this will be a problem While the Trump platform is heavily on deregulation Trump s nominee to head the U S Department of Health and Human Services which oversees the FDA is Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kennedy has spent years advocating against food additives he says are literally poisoning our children Kennedy commonly referred to as RFK Jr has built a career railing against corporate influence and calling for tighter regulations particularly for food pharmaceutical and chemical industries While some of his views are considered controversial many environmental and public health advocates are hopeful he will make the changes they want to see The question here for RFK if he does become nominated is is he going to do more than just go after a few chemicals here and there said Jose Is he going to listen to the science is he going to listen to us and actually try to fix the FDA That will remain to be seen Originally published by The New Lede Shannon Kelleher is a reporter at The New Lede", "chunk_id":

university He s also lived this history as a child his father farmed 320 acres in Knox County It was just not an operation that allowed me to come back to farm Johnson said You have to adapt The trend

Nebraska voters passed a law that reined in corporations ability to own ag land But that law known as Initiative 300 was struck down by a federal circuit court in 2007 Nebraska now has virtually no restrictions on corporate ownership of land fewer restrictions than the seven other states across the Midwest and Great Plains that at one point passed an Initiative 300 like law said Anthony Schutz a UNL professor specializing in agricultural law Absent some legislative change or something of that nature I think the investor pool is gonna continue said Pavelka These investors often hire local helpers sometimes farm managers like Pavelka or rent out the ground It s common for beginning farmers to start by renting land But for Alward it s proven a challenge to find the 150 acres he s looking to lease next year for his dozens of cattle and pigs Having pastures next to each other would save him serious time Owning those pastures instead of renting would over the long haul save him money His dilemma is one understood by many younger American farmers About 10 000 young farmers and ranchers surveyed nationwide reported owning slightly more than 80 acres on average according to a 2022 survey A little more than half are actually owners while just less than half work as managers or hired hands on someone else s operation And owning land is key in large part because it helps agricultural producers withstand market turbulence said Hassebrook who was a lead proponent of Initiative 300 Even if you re not super wealthy that ownership of land that s partially somewhat paid off becomes an enormous value to you in weathering the dry years and low price years he said Top farmland buyers by acreage FFP112301Whos_buying_Nebraska_value_slides11 jpg

Nebraska s Keith and Arthur counties to graze 1 year old cattle from spring till fall The Sandhills is in a different weather belt than much of his other land and thus offers him some drought protection if it s dry in eastern Colorado or eastern Wyoming Technology is another big reason acquiring large amounts of Nebraska land makes sense for his business he said Forty years ago hauling animals 130 miles would have been unimaginable Now he receives text alerts on his phone when his livestock water tanks at the ranch run dry The ranch land he bought was the right size available at the time he said He wants to make sure he s building an enterprise with opportunities for the next generation of ranchers in his family We re long term players said Burnett For the cards that I can see today I would say we d be more apt to be on the buyer side than on the seller side He doesn t see himself as an absentee owner living just across the Wyoming border and visiting often If I pulled up to a neighbor s house in Henry Nebraska or Keystone Nebraska or wherever in Nebraska I would like for my neighbors to know who I am and be glad that I pulled in he said The change in Nebraska s

investors Johnson said The latest U S Department of Agriculture USDA land ownership survey indicates that a third of Nebraska agricultural landlords have never farmed The growth of absentee owners is not unique to Nebraska In neighboring Iowa 27 of agricultural land purchases last year were connected to an investor buyer including local farmers and non local businesses up from 21 in 2019 according to an Iowa State University survey These absentee owners do contribute to the local property tax base But they don t live in the community go to the grocery store or send their children to the local school Instead they extract value from the land and send the profits elsewhere which can distort local economies and impair the health of rural communities said Jessica Shoemaker a UNL law professor When an owner is instead an investor making decisions in a boardroom in Chicago or New York we worry that those decisions might miss some of the local complexity and may not care as much about local impacts Shoemaker wrote in an email A higher rate of absent agricultural landowners in an area corresponds to a lower local employment rate a 2021 USDA report found The USDA report identified no association between soil health and absentee owners But some also worry that they aren t the best stewards of Nebraska s soil and water Absentee landowners have an opportunity to push for best farming practices Johnson said I think a lot of these people are very professionally oriented and probably also focusing on long term good stewardship he said And sometimes even maybe putting a little pressure on those who farmed the land to say Hey can we be sure that we are not diminishing our resource base While it s often harder for even mid sized farmers to buy land it s not impossible In 2020

lawmakers are being asked to consider two dueling pieces of legislation one that protects the right of Americans to sue a pesticide maker if exposure to the company s product harms their health and one that protects chemical companies from those very types of lawsuits Sen Cory Booker D N J today introduced the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act of 2025 The proposed bill would amend the existing Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA law to ensure that agrochemical manufacturers can be held accountable if their products harm human health If passed the law would turn the tables on efforts by Bayer and a coalition of agricultural organizations as they push for state by state legislation blocking individuals from being able to file lawsuits in state courts accusing the companies of failing to warn of the risks of their products investigative reporter Carey Gillam wrote in The New Lede Meanwhile on Tuesday a U S House of Representatives subcommittee approved an appropriations bill with a clause that would make it more difficult for states to regulate pesticides or for people harmed by agrochemicals to sue the companies that make them according to the Center for Food Safety The clause limits the use of federal funds to regulate pesticides by restricting regulators ability to create new rules or require warnings stronger than those already approved by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA The House Appropriations Interior Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee approved the clause during its mark up session for the fiscal year 2026 bill which authorizes 37 9 billion in funding for the EPA the U S Forest Service and other agencies The bill will go to the full committee next week for approval Experts expect that a similar provision will be included in the new Farm Bill If passed the legislation would mean that labels for pesticides like glyphosate based Roundup can t be updated with new warnings even when evidence shows risks

health risks associated with their products Those failure to warn claims are based on state tort law and allege that Bayer knew or should have known about the risks and yet still failed to warn consumers according to the National Agricultural Law Center Bayer has countered that the EPA rules trump state rules and because the company s labels meet the requirements of the EPA which doesn t classify glyphosate as a carcinogen or require other warning labels the failure to warn claims are moot Some courts have ruled in favor of Bayer but most have ruled against the chemical giant In the process Bayer has had to pay more than 10 billion to settle Roundup weedkiller lawsuits The U S Supreme Court has thus far declined to hear Bayer s appeals although it is considering one now Appropriations clause intended to kill the lawsuits As the issue works its way through the courts Bayer is lobbying state legislatures to pass laws that critics say give agrochemical companies a liability shield At least 12 and as many as 21 states are proposing industry drafted bills to grant agrochemical companies immunity from liability for harms from their products if those products are licensed by the EPA according to Moms Across America So far Georgia and North Dakota have passed liability shield laws that declare the EPA has oversight of pesticide labeling and that state laws can t hold the companies liable for failing to warn about anything not required by the EPA The EPA in January announced it was also advancing a proposal to block states from requiring warning labels on

accountable for harm caused by their toxic products Booker s Pesticide Injury Accountability Act explicitly states that it does not preempt state law However if people are unable to bring their lawsuits in state courts because of liability shields the proposed legislation gives them the right to bring a case in federal court A summary of the bill calls out Bayer and Syngenta which makes paraquat a weedkiller linked to Parkinson s disease Booker said his proposed bill was a direct response to the liability shield that Republican lawmakers are attempting to push through Rather than providing a liability shield so that foreign corporations are allowed to poison the American people Congress should instead pass the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act to ensure that these chemical companies can be held accountable in federal court for the harm caused by their toxic products he said in a statement announcing the bill The statement also quoted CHD CEO Mary Holland who said CHD opposes any liability shield for any industry that has a direct impact on the health of the American people Granting blanket immunity to corporations who have a fiscal responsibility to their shareholders and not a responsibility to consumer safety is one of the most dangerous propositions imaginable CHD sincerely thanks Senator Booker for his leadership in sponsoring this critical piece

the total number of cells in the sample including bacteria that are alive damaged and dead The effectiveness of probiotics is often linked to their ability to colonize the gut and exert beneficial metabolic activities TFUs do not provide information about the metabolic activity or viability of the bacteria which are critical for assessing probiotic effectiveness The same goes for active

are not representative of the number of live bacteria in the product Probiotic potency explained CFU AFU and TFU When evaluating the potency of probiotics three units of measurement often come into discussion Colony Forming Units CFUs AFUs and TFUs Understanding the distinction between these units is important for both consumers and health care professionals to assess the effectiveness and quality of probiotic supplements accurately CFUs This is the most widely recognized and utilized metric for quantifying the number of viable bacteria or fungal cells in a probiotic product One CFU represents a single microorganism capable of dividing and forming a colony under specific laboratory conditions This measure is important because the therapeutic benefits of probiotics are directly related to the number of live microorganisms that reach your gut Probiotic manufacturers typically list CFU counts on product labels indicating the number of live organisms per serving Higher CFU counts are often marketed as more potent though the optimal CFU dosage varies depending on the specific strains and the health outcomes targeted It s important to note that not all CFUs are equal the efficacy of a probiotic also depends on the strains used and their ability to survive the acidic environment of the stomach to colonize the intestines AFUs This unit is a less conventional and not widely standardized measure in the context of probiotics While CFU shows the number of bacteria that are alive AFU refers to the total number of bacteria present both dead and alive It is primarily a unit used to measure enzymatic activity For instance AFU could be used to evaluate the activity levels of specific enzymes produced by probiotics which contribute to their health benefits such as breaking down lactose or producing vitamins In some specialized applications AFU is also used to assess the metabolic activity or functional potency of probiotic strains beyond mere viability However

both live and dead cells through fluorescent labeling and is typically used only for pasteurized products Like AFU TFU values are higher than CFU counts for the same sample since they include both viable and non viable cells The primary difference between CFU AFU and TFU lies in what they measure CFU quantifies the number of live microorganisms AFU assesses the functional activity of those microorganisms and TFU measures the total bacterial mass regardless of their functional activity While CFUs provide a clear indicator of the potential for colonization and survival of probiotics in the gut AFUs could offer additional insights into the functional capabilities of the probiotic strains However due to the lack of standardization and widespread recognition of AFUs in the probiotic

colon oxygenation is essential for the success of any gut health intervention FAQs about gut microbes Q How does the gut microbiome influence stress resilience and mental health A The BGM system plays a critical role in stress resilience Research shows that people with higher resilience have more active gut bacteria that help reduce inflammation support energy production and adapt to environmental changes These individuals also display distinct brain structure patterns including stronger reward system connections and better emotional regulation Gut bacterial activity was found to be the strongest predictor of resilience suggesting that supporting the microbiome could improve stress response and mental well being Q What is gut dysbiosis and how is it linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders A Gut dysbiosis is a microbial imbalance that contributes to mental health disorders like depression anxiety and Alzheimer s Depressed individuals often have lower levels of butyrate producing bacteria which are essential for gut integrity and inflammation control Dysbiosis disrupts gut brain communication triggering immune and neural inflammation This imbalance can impair neurotransmitter production and brain barrier function promoting psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease progression Supporting a healthy microbiome may reduce these risks Q Why is mitochondrial function important for Akkermansia supplementation A Akkermansia thrives in a low oxygen colon environment which requires healthy mitochondrial function to maintain When mitochondrial energy is compromised due to factors like seed oil consumption oxygen accumulates in the colon killing beneficial bacteria like Akkermansia Supplementing alone isn t effective unless you first restore

Alex Berenson reported Tuesday Berenson a former New York Times reporter who now reports on his Unreported Truths Substack revealed communications with Taiwanese researchers showing they found striking evidence that the shots themselves may cause asthma which leads to lung damage Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting nearly 5 million U S children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC While usually not fatal severe asthma attacks can be life threatening in children according to the Mayo Clinic The Taiwanese researchers analysis which the researchers are still reviewing used electronic medical records from TriNetX which touts itself as the largest global source of real world data The study authors looked at TriNetX s health data from over 200 000 U S kids ages 5 to 18 between Jan 1 2021 and Dec 31 2022 According to Berenson they found that children who received a COVID 19 mRNA shot and who had not had a natural COVID 19 infection had a 13 higher risk of receiving a new asthma diagnosis in the year after their vaccination when compared to a matched group of children who didn t get a COVID 19 shot or infection That increased risk cannot be due to Covid since neither group was infected Berenson wrote When the researchers compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated children all of whom also were diagnosed with a COVID 19 infection they found an even higher risk Berenson reported that children who had both a COVID 19 mRNA shot and a COVID 19 infection had a 20 higher risk of a new asthma diagnosis than a similar group of unvaccinated kids who had a COVID 19 infection Because the study is not a randomized prospective trial it does not prove that the mRNA COVID 19 shots caused the extra asthma cases Berenson said But the researchers closely matched two very large groups he wrote and the association they found is almost certainly not due to chance They may have some trouble getting a major or even minor journal to accept their results The

the increased risk was more marked in those vaccinated Berenson wrote on Substack But because the researchers had not matched the groups by vaccine status in the initial study the vaccinated group was notably less healthy than the unvaccinated group at baseline So the jabbed and unjabbed cohorts could not be directly compared Berenson asked the researchers in an email if they had run a parallel

that many asthma symptoms are the same as those associated with anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction Coughing wheezing bronchospasm shortness of breath rapid breathing dyspnea and hypoxia these airway symptoms occur when the immune and nervous systems are significantly activated in response to exposure to one or more allergens the body perceives as a threat If COVID injections seem to

vaccinated Berenson said the Taiwanese researchers finding about a possible link between COVID 19 vaccines and asthma was particularly striking because they weren t looking for it They conducted the June 21 study using children s health data from TriNetX to determine if there might be a link between COVID 19 infection and asthma In their report they explained that they used a cohort matching technique before doing their analysis to minimize the likelihood of getting biased results due to confounding factors Using the matching technique they created an unvaccinated cohort and a vaccinated cohort that each had equal numbers of kids who had and hadn t had a COVID 19 infection They compared the asthma diagnosis outcomes of kids who had a COVID 19 infection with the asthma diagnosis outcomes of kids who hadn t in both the unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts They found that the children infected with COVID 19 showed a significantly increased incidence of new onset asthma during the year after the infection compared with kids who hadn t had a COVID 19 infection and the finding was consistent across gender age and racial groups They also found that the increased risk of new onset asthma was more marked in those children who had COVID 19 and also received an mRNA COVID 19 vaccine Berenson noted in his Oct 2 Substack post that the Taiwanese authors June study has received little attention despite the vaccine safety signals it contains In addition to finding that the link between COVID 19 infection and asthma was stronger in kids who got a COVID 19 shot the study authors found that children who received a COVID 19 shot were 6 times more likely to die during the next year than kids who didn t get a COVID 19 shot The most likely explanation for the difference is that the kids in the vaccinated cohort were sicker to begin with compared to the unvaccinated For instance the kids in the vaccinated cohort had higher rates of diabetes and psychiatric disorders

new sister variant BA 2 causes more serious infections than the original version though initial data shows it s more transmissible The WHO and other researchers around the world have found that Omicron generally doesn t make people as sick as the Delta variant though it does spread faster than previous strains of the virus and can evade some of the immune protection provided by vaccines

of Genetics at the University of Jena told the German language science program Nano Some scientists have managed to manipulate public opinion including politicians and the media Theissen said during a segment last week on the German Austrian Swiss public broadcaster 3sat The program presented evidence corroborated by several scientists interviewed by the program that SARS CoV 2 the virus responsible for COVID 19 was developed in a laboratory According to Nano The tip of the spike protein with which SARS CoV 2 docks onto the ACE2 receptor in the lungs fits surprisingly well Particularly striking however is another gene segment of the virus the so called furin cleavage site This enables the pathogen to perfectly enter human cells According to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request SARS CoV 2 has a unique furin cleavage site positioned in the spike protein at the S1 S2 junction suggesting it was engineered Virologists have yet to identify one in any other related coronavirus Whether there will ever be conclusive proof of the virus s origin remains to be seen But one thing is certain science has not covered itself in glory when it comes to this issue Nano concluded Rutgers University molecular biologist Richard Ebright Ph D said the Nano report presented a convincing case in favor of the lab leak theory Ebright is a critic of gain of

Holmes Ph D wrote that SARS CoV 2 Seems to have been pre adapted for human spread since the get go But during an April 2020 White House briefing Fauci said the paper provided evidence totally

the Chinese military Experts say that the implications of this new study could be far reaching By identifying the possible fingerprint of Baric s methodology the study raises the possibility of potentially devastating liability for NIAID UNC and other parties Scientists including those close to Dr Anthony Fauci have repeatedly pointed out that SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 has genomic sequences that appear inconsistent with natural evolution The COVID 19 virus is no longer infectious in bats and its spiked protein feature which is unknown in this family of coronavirus includes numerous mutations that make it ideally infectious in humans The closest known coronavirus relative a coronavirus from the Wuhan lab is 96 2 identical to SARS CoV 2 The peculiar spike accounts almost completely for the entire 3 8 difference Oddly there are multiple novel mutations in the spike and almost none in the rest of the genome Natural evolution would be expected to leave mutations distributed evenly across the genome The fact that virtually all the mutations occur on the spike led these scientists to suspect that that particular Wuhan lab coronavirus collected by Shi Zhengli is the direct progenitor of SARS CoV 2 and that its new spike was implanted through engineering However the unmistakable fingerprints of lab engineering were absent leaving many experts wondering whether Baric s technique was used to assemble a novel coronavirus with the engineered spike while removing the evidence of lab generation This new study connects the biological breadcrumbs

COVID 19 virus These sites allow special enzymes called restriction enzymes to cut the DNA into building blocks of unique size that then can be stitched together in the correct order of the viral genome according to the study s authors Essentially Baric s technique leaves behind unique spellings in the genetic vocabulary The new words include odd spelling choices subtly distinguishing them from typical viral vocabulary The magic of Baric s no see m technique is to invisibly weave these telltale spelling changes into the viral sequence between relevant genes without altering the viral protein This is like changing the spelling of the word without changing its meaning the casual listener will never notice the difference The research team used forensic tools to drill down on minute spelling differences in the SARS CoV2 genome that betray laboratory tampering using the no see m technique Consider how a Brit would spell colour manoeuvre or paediatric The choice to spell a word in a certain way can reveal your nation of origin Similarly these nearly imperceptible changes in the viral sequence give away the laboratory origins of this virus In sharing his seamless ligation

over 75 years and the vast majority had immunity to COVID 19 The vaccines were also aimed against variants that were already rare or extinct The vaccines that the WHO will mandate are planned to include mRNA vaccines produced within 100 days by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI mRNA vaccines are modified genetic material the mRNA is changed to persist longer than our own mRNA in a lipid envelope Biodistribution studies from Pfizer BioNTech indicate that they are expected to concentrate in the ovaries adrenal glands liver and spleen as well as the injection site and are also distributed throughout the body including the nervous system After entering cells these cells produce the foreign protein coded by the mRNA which is then expressed on the surface of the cell and circulates within the body The body then mounts an immune response to this protein killing the cells that express it and causing local inflammation also creating a low level inflammatory response This is how mRNA vaccines work CEPI a key player running the rushed vaccine effort is a public private partnership set up at the World Economic Forum in 2017 by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation a major pharmaceutical investor the Wellcome Trust and a number of countries CEPI was specifically set up to make vaccines and similar products for pandemics at a time when the world had

vaccination including changes in cycle length flow and menstrual pain according to a new state of the science review published Monday in BMJ Sexual Reproductive Health Although women comprised about half of the participants in the original COVID 19 vaccine trials no data were collected on how the shots affected their menstrual cycles Soon after the shots were rolled out many women started reporting longer periods and heavier than normal bleeding and many women who did not normally menstruate including women on long acting contraceptives and post menopausal women also reported unusual bleeding Tens of thousands of women reported symptoms to researchers and medical regulators in the U S and the United Kingdom respectively by mid 2021 At the time women s concerns were often blown off and they felt gaslighted Dr Alison Edelman one of the review article authors told NBC Researchers called for studies into the issue in part because they said disrupted menstrual cycles were driving misinformation that the vaccines were dangerous and fueling vaccine hesitancy Since then dozens of studies have been published on the issue For the BMJ review researchers from Harvard Boston University Michigan State University and Oregon Health Science University surveyed and summarized the existing published literature in the PubMed database which contains peer reviewed research in the biomedical and life sciences literature on the COVID 19 vaccines and menstruation Overall data from published studies indicate small transient changes in menstrual cycle length ie longer cycle length following vaccination they concluded Additionally there is some evidence that other menstrual characteristics such as menstrual pain menstrual flow and intermenstrual bleeding also occur following vaccination Because there is more limited research less is known for certain about the shot s effects on specific age groups such as adolescents or post menopausal women However data suggest that breakthrough bleeding or menstrual cycle changes affect them they wrote Evidence also suggests the menstrual cycle phase a woman is in at the time of vaccination may play a role in how vaccination

not necessarily measure the same outcomes Some mixed results but shots effects were undeniable The researchers identified 53 studies on vaccination and menstruation published before Oct 31 2023 These included 11 prospective cohort studies which observed a group of women over time to see the effects of the shot 11 retrospective cohort studies which looked backward after the fact at the effects of the shot on a group of women and 31 cross sectional or retrospective case control studies which looked backward at the effects of the shot by comparing women who experienced a symptom to those who didn t They evaluated the papers for risk of bias and summarized the findings according to the primary ways the COVID 19 vaccine disrupted women s menstrual cycles First they found with certainty that the COVID 19 vaccine is associated with changes in cycle length at least in adult populations noting that adolescent girls were more difficult to study Most of the studies which had focused on cycle length because it is typically a well tracked and easily defined outcome found the shot was associated with a longer cycle Studies investigating cycle irregularities other than length were fewer and more mixed the researchers reported Some of these showed the shots had short term effects and others revealed issues such as missed periods and intermenstrual bleeding with symptoms increasing with the second and then subsequent shots Existing studies showed a clear association with cycle irregularities but were insufficient to determine cause they concluded There were also studies examining the vaccines effect on menstrual flow These data they said were easier to access because there are many period tracking apps that women use to track their flows However the data for this metric were also contradictory They reported several studies like one that analyzed data in an app that didn t identify a difference in the lighter and heavier flow days during menstruation although they did find a heavier flow overall However several studies also found a change in flow following vaccination Although the researchers emphasized the mixed nature of the results for this metric they conceded that

20 40 of menstruating women experience menstrual pain following vaccination and that the pain is similar following both the first and second vaccination doses They also reported that women with endometriosis a painful condition where the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus had worse cycle abnormalities including fatigue pain and regularity disorders than other women Several larger studies examining population data found a slightly increased risk of bleeding in postmenopausal women One large study found the risk increased in the 16 weeks following vaccination Another found an especially strong statistically significant risk following a third dose of the vaccine A 2022 analysis of the COVID 19 V safe data a voluntary smartphone based active surveillance system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 4 of the 84 943 reports of menstrual disturbances associated with the shot included postmenopausal bleeding Taken together it does appear that many postmenopausal individuals experienced some abnormal vaginal bleeding following COVID 19 vaccination and this information is critically important information for this population to know when considering the potential side effects of the COVID 19 vaccination the authors wrote The studies suggested that women using hormonal contraception were somewhat protected from the effects of vaccination on their menstrual cycle For example one study found that women taking hormonal contraception had a shorter delay in their cycle than those who weren t taking it The effects varied with different types of contraception Another study found women taking hormonal contraception had more breakthrough bleeding than women who weren t taking it The researchers also noted that all of the studies were conducted with women who had regular menstrual cycles pre vaccination because it is too difficult to discern whether irregularities among women who already have irregular periods are vaccine related or not This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today However many women with irregular cycles also reported more irregularities following the shot Existing studies they concluded tend to have a moderate to high risk of bias For example cross sectional and retrospective studies select participants after vaccination and after menstrual changes have occurred so these may have some kind of selection bias There is also a danger when self reporting that", "chunk_id":

when self reporting that research subjects will make spurious associations they said Many of the studies also didn t have access to vaccination data so they couldn t differentiate among vaccines The researchers also noted that the causal mechanisms through which the COVID 19 vaccines affected menstruation is unknown They said It is not surprising that temporary changes to the menstrual cycle could occur with vaccination hypothesizing that a combination of stress and inflammation could affect the balance of hormones that determine the cycle The researchers concluded that there is now solid evidence from the past three years indicating the effect of the COVID 19 vaccine on the menstrual cycle Most of the papers they analyzed were published in smaller obstetrics and gynecology journals because academic medicine doesn t consider it an important issue they said They encouraged wider future publication and also called for measuring and monitoring of menstrual cycles to be included as a

their Academic Publishing Cartel Hulscher said Hulscher s co authors include Dr Harvey Risch Dr Peter A McCullough and Dr William Makis Hulscher told The Defender the study provides robust evidence that COVID 19 vaccines can cause death This means that the FDA s U S Food and Drug Administration criteria for a Class I recall have been fulfilled warranting an immediate market withdrawal The FDA defines a Class I product recall as a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death

related to COVID 19 vaccination in which the death occurred after vaccination They screened out 562 duplicate studies among the 678 studies initially identified in their search Other papers were removed because they lacked information about vaccination status Ultimately they evaluated 44 papers containing 325 autopsies and one necropsy case Three physicians independently reviewed each case and adjudicated whether or not the COVID 19 shot was the direct cause or contributed significantly to the death reported They found 240 of the deaths 73 9 were found to be directly due to or

They said the findings amplify existing concerns about the vaccines including those related to vaccine induced myocarditis and myocardial infarction and the effects of the spike protein more broadly They also said the studies have implications for unanticipated deaths among vaccinated people with no previous illness We can infer that in such cases death may have been caused by COVID 19

an evolving understanding of the vaccines which are currently different from when the studies evaluated were published They also noted that systematic reviews have bias potential in general because of biases that may exist at the level of the individual papers and their acceptance into the peer reviewed literature They said publication bias could have affected their results because the global push for mass vaccination has made investigators hesitant to report adverse events They also said their research did not account for confounding variables like concomitant illnesses drug interactions and

Tells Court Children s Health Defense and thousands of concerned parents on March 16 filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit seeking to stop the Louisana Department of Health from adding COVID 19 vaccines

a lawsuit seeking to stop the Louisana Department of Health LDH from adding COVID 19 vaccines to the state s school immunization schedule Under a rule promulgated by the LDH and approved by Gov John Edwards Louisiana joined California in requiring children to receive COVID vaccines in order to attend school The mandate expressly applies to kindergartens and covers children age 5 and older An amicus brief is a document submitted by an individual or organization that is not a party to a legal case but is permitted by the court to offer expertise or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case In its brief CHD argued data do not support mandatory COVID vaccines and it is scientifically unjustifiable to impose the requirement on children The brief states Simply put the COVID vaccines have not been shown to be either effective or safe for children The benefits to children are minuscule while the risks including the risk of potentially fatal heart damage are known and serious as the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA itself has acknowledged Moreover it is undisputed that the existing COVID vaccines do not prevent COVID at best they reduce the incidence of severe disease outcomes and hence COVID is not a vaccine preventable disease as a result COVID vaccines cannot be made mandatory for school attendance under express Louisiana statutory law Finally with the rise of Omicron the vaccines have become wholly ineffective at preventing infection and hence vaccination will not prevent children from catching COVID and spreading the disease to others Indeed even as of August 2021 prior to enactment of Louisiana s mandate the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention itself admitted that what the vaccines can t do anymore is prevent transmission CHD also submitted a comprehensive study published Feb 28 of more than 365 000 children ages 5 to 11 showing COVID vaccines did not have the 90 effectiveness claimed by their manufacturers Instead vaccine effectiveness was shown to be a mere 12 Also cited in the brief was an article by The New York Times showing vaccination offered virtually no protection against infection

argument for mandating a COVID vaccination for children About 4 700 Louisana parents joined CHD in filing the brief According to the brief parents are deeply concerned about the lack of data establishing the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines for children and seek to defend the right of all parents in this state to choose for themselves whether or not to have their children vaccinated In its argument CHD said medical law and ethics require every proposed medical intervention satisfy a simple well established test Its benefits must outweigh its risks According to CHD COVID vaccines have not been shown to be safe or effective for children and not a single governmental health agency pharmaceutical company or study has shown vaccines are effective or safe for children On the contrary the medical benefits of pediatric COVID vaccination are infinitesimal while the risks of an adverse reaction are extremely serious the brief states Risks of COVID vaccines for children entirely unknown CHD argued in its brief the full medical risks of COVID vaccines for children are entirely unknown but known risks are extremely serious Because the vaccines were authorized in record time there is no long term data whatsoever on long term adverse pediatric health effects CHD wrote But as the FDA itself has acknowledged the existing data already show known serious risks of myocarditis a potentially fatal heart condition caused by the COVID vaccines that predominantly affects younger individuals According to a 10 year tracking study published in 2020 in the Journal of the American Heart Association more than half of myocarditis patients had a condition called late gadolinium enhancement LGE and 39 of those patients died within 10 years The overall 10 year mortality rate among myocarditis patients was approximately 20 CHD wrote According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association the rate of reported myocarditis following COVID vaccination is 70 7 per million among boys 12 to 15 and 105 9 per million among boys 16 to 17 years old CHD concluded While all must profoundly hope for a different result if the 20 10 year mortality rate holds true

vaccines do not prevent spread CHD said that by statute Louisiana expressly restricts mandatory immunization of children as a condition of school attendance to vaccine preventable diseases According to DC Health vaccine preventable diseases VPDs are infectious diseases caused by viruses or bacteria that can be prevented with vaccines The CDC website provides a list of VPDs and serious diseases that can be prevented by vaccines COVID is not on the list because COVID vaccines do not prevent the infection as evidenced both by the CDC website and increasing number of vaccine breakthrough cases

opposition Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry R and state Rep Raymond Crews R in December 2021 filed the joint lawsuit against Gov John Bel Edwards D after he announced COVID vaccines would be mandatory for all children age 5 and over at public or private schools The Hill reported Landry and Crews contend Edwards decision to force children to receive COVID vaccines to attend school was an overreach of power and violated the state constitution The only thing standing in the way of this overreach is the very document that protects Louisianans from the unbounded exercise of executive authority the Louisiana Constitution the lawsuit reads The Louisiana Constitution grants the Governor the power only to enforce the law not to make it Louisiana s bipartisan House Committee on Health

control agenda Not one to mince words author Naomi Wolf makes the case that the passports if allowed to become the norm could trigger the end of civil society and literally the end of human liberty in the West Why is there such a strong push to make travel and commerce contingent on vaccine passports One important answer well understood by Wolf as CEO of a tech company is location intelligence what technocracy expert Patrick Wood calls the heart and soul of Technocracy and Scientific Dictatorship Without irony the champions of location data rhapsodize that such data are a powerful way to connect people to place transactions to actions responses to trends and customers to where they do business and the kind of business they do ultimately facilitating the digital transformation of society on the whole Less cheerfully technocrats understand even if the general public does not that location data permit control at the most granular levels and provide a platform for understanding what s going on at all scales This point was disturbingly illustrated in a June 21 study in JAMA Internal Medicine which essentially denounced small and informal social gatherings positing that children s birthday parties are potential hotbeds of SARS CoV 2 transmission This willingness on the part of technocracy s foot soldiers to be party poopers literally would be silly were it not for the study s baleful

and attendees to limit the number of guests wear a mask with two or more layers indoors and outdoors except when eating or drinking socially distance avoid handshakes and hugs supply one s own food and dishes and precluding any Happy Birthday songs avoid any loud cheering or singing Better yet CDC says simply have a virtual gathering The JAMA birthday party study helpfully reinforces the CDC s dour advice Conducted by private sector researchers from RAND Corporation Harvard and healthcare navigation company Castlight Health the study looked at privately insured households whose members did or did not have a birthday in the preceding two weeks and county level COVID 19 prevalence data but included no data from actual social gatherings Taken at face value one can see how the study s take home message that households in certain counties were possibly a little bit more likely to receive a COVID diagnosis subsequent to an adult or child having a birthday could direct worriers toward the CDC s virtual gathering solution However one needs to parse the study s definition of risk As has become par for the course in risk pronouncements designed to steer COVID related behavior in a particular direction the researchers said nothing about absolute risk even though many consider absolute risk statistics to be the most useful way of presenting research results to help decision making Thus while the study reported a 31 relative increase in COVID diagnoses associated with birthdays a finding moreover that pertained solely to households in the 10 of counties with the highest background prevalence of COVID the increased absolute risk again only in the 10 of high background prevalence counties amounted to a flimsy 0 086 increase over the COVID background rate of 278 100

being dangled as a mechanism for freedom By showing proof that you ve received a COVID 19 vaccine perhaps you can once again board an airplane and travel freely attend a concert or enjoy a meal in your favorite restaurant just like you used to Except being required to present your papers in order to live your life isn t actually freedom at all it s discrimination and even a move toward technocratic fascism one that s setting the stage for increased surveillance and erosion of your privacy Nonetheless this blatant move toward an ever increasing surveillance state is being welcomed by many who have been led to believe the passports are necessary to protect public health and safety Vaccine passports are in development It s likely only a matter of time before you ll be asked to prove

logged centrally by the National Immunization Vaccination System using their NHS number This information could be easily linked with an app Around the world vaccine passports are rapidly being rolled out including in Denmark which was one of the first to roll them out As of September 2021 dozens of countries around the world have implemented vaccine passports while in the U S plans for vaccine IDs are under evaluation International efforts are also underway The Commons Project and the World Economic Forum created the Common Trust Network which developed the CommonPass app that s intended to act as a health passport The app allows users to upload medical data such as a COVID 19 test result or proof of vaccination which then generates a QR code that you will show to authorities as your health passport The proposed common framework for safe border reopening around the world involves the following Every nation must publish their health screening criteria for entry into the country using a standard format on a common framework Each country must register trusted facilities that conduct COVID 19 lab testing for foreign travel and administer vaccines listed in the CommonPass registry Each country will accept health screening status from foreign visitors through apps and services built on the CommonPass framework Patient identification is to be collected at the time of sample collection and or vaccination using an international standard The CommonPass framework will be integrated into flight and hotel reservation check in processes Eventually the CommonPass framework will be integrated with already existing personal health apps such as Apple Health and CommonHealth If you want to travel your personal health record will be evaluated and compared to a country s entry

surveys about such technologies with overwhelming positivity reported The first measured public acceptance of location tracking through your cellphone that would allow health agencies to monitor your contact with others to target social distancing and quarantine measures About 70 of the respondents said they would accept such an app that they could choose to download and surprisingly 65 also said they would accept such an app even if it was mandated by the government and used to locate those violating lockdown orders and issue fines and arrests A second survey evaluated acceptance of vaccine passports with 60 stating they were in favor and only 20 stating they were strongly opposed The study s lead author professor Stephan Lewandowsky described those opposed as surprisingly low adding It s fascinating how people seem increasingly receptive to their personal data being used to inform themselves and others about what they can and can t do Prendergast put this widespread acceptance into further context for the British who have traditionally been deeply suspicious of the idea of an official asking for papers please This is why there was such a backlash against Blair s ID cards As one

Authority alone is spending an estimated 380 million annually on COVID related sanitation and when it asked the U S government whether they should be focusing on fomites or solely aerosols they were told to continue their focus on fomites Writing in The Atlantic Derek Thompson describes this as a type of hygiene theater in which Americans are going through the motions of dutifully cleaning and likely over disinfecting surfaces when the virus spreads most efficiently through the air Indeed much of the COVID 19 pandemic response has been embroiled in theatrics including mask mandates for which the scientific evidence has been described as astonishingly weak Hygiene theater much like the theater for vaccine passports provides an illusion of safety not one grounded in reality Discussion to ban Florida travel for disobedience In the U S Florida announced in December 2020 that it would have no more lockdowns and no statewide mask mandates The act resulted in retaliation by federal

lack of vaccine transparency vaccinators themselves are not properly informed so are generally not in any position to offer accurate information that might be available in the public domain but is generally not well known Information that should be freely communicated includes the fact that the vaccines are experimental and unproven Those considering giving consent should be told about the

contentious custody situations the court considers each parent s stance on vaccines within the larger context of custody and decision making Which parent can best provide sound decision making for the

has moved the issue of vaccine administration out of what until now was primarily the school enrollment scenario to a broader arena encompassing adults and therefore the judges who make custody decisions COVID has made this issue personal How should parents who don t want their children to receive COVID vaccines navigate this issue There are many ways to approach this subject if you don t

authority to make healthcare decisions for the children and what state has jurisdiction over your child custody matters In most states courts favor parents having joint legal custody of their children While the phrase joint legal custody sounds simple the parents are equal each having the same say in the lives of the children it is really the language on how decisions will be made and how an impasse is resolved that determines who has the right to make the decision If the parents cannot come to a consensus on whether their child should be vaccinated most parenting agreements provide a

inform the other parent about COVID vaccines It is often helpful for both parents to understand why they may disagree about their child receiving a vaccine and determine if there is a way to compromise At the same time many parents find it difficult to communicate with each other especially about controversial issues like vaccines Mediation might provide the perfect forum for a conversation about vaccines Mediation is a process wherein the parties meet with a mutually selected impartial and neutral person who assists them in discussing and negotiating their differences Many states require mediation to resolve disputes between the parties and help them facilitate a parenting agreement without the intervention of the court Mediation is also sometimes a prerequisite that must be completed before bringing an unresolved issue to the attention of a judge This process allows you to present your viewpoint and any science behind your position to the other parent in a more

issue of COVID vaccines for litigation in court can be costly and time consuming Both sides will present experts and provide testimony and the bias of some judges may lead to decisions that do not favor the non vaccinating parent It is always best if at all possible to resolve disputes over vaccines outside of court If the issue must be litigated courts are hesitant to get into arguments of vaccine safety and efficacy What they want to know is whether you re capable of making healthcare decisions or if there s a dispute which parent s wishes should prevail The first step to addressing this issue is to refer to your parenting agreement or dissolution of marriage document on who has decision making authority over healthcare matters and what remedy is listed if the parties cannot come to an agreement If healthcare decisions are to be made jointly then one parent does not have the right to subject the child to a medical procedure without the authorization of the other parent If a dispute arises and the parties cannot come to an agreement a petition will have to be filed in court to modify parental responsibilities based on a significant change in circumstances Most courts have held that the issue of whether or not a child should receive a COVID vaccine is an issue justifying court intervention Once the court agrees to hear the matter you will have to argue why you should have decision making authority over whether your child should receive a COVID vaccine Parents should keep the court focused on which parent has been the primary parent when it comes to decision making

Alter Human Genome A World Council for Health panel of international scientists revealed that COVID 19 mRNA vaccines are contaminated with plasmid DNA from the manufacturing process This not only can cause inflammation and cancers but can damage DNA perhaps even pass genetic alterations to children Experts say regulators ignored the risks and urge a recall of all mRNA vaccines You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The World Council for Health on Monday convened an international panel of scientists and medical experts to discuss recent revelations that COVID 19 mRNA vaccines are contaminated with bacterial DNA plasmids that can harm human health Describing the findings as probably the most important topic of our time the panelists addressed PlasmidGate and its implications for all people of the world The hearing addressed the discovery of bacterial DNA left over from the microscopic plasmids used for multiplying DNA in the mRNA vaccine manufacturing process One of the gene therapy tools discovered in COVID 19 vaccines is SV40 which is known to be cancer promoting These foreign substances may also be responsible for the high numbers of severe adverse events and deaths following COVID 19 vaccines but health regulators across the world have thus far ignored the connection participants said World Council for Health steering committee members Dr Mark Trozzi and Christof Plothe D O moderated the hearing which included the following participants Plothe opened the hearing describing the issue of DNA plasmid contamination in mRNA vaccines as probably the most important topic of our time Trozzi described efforts to raise awareness of the issue as a David versus Goliath fight referring to the World Council for Health s limited resources in comparison to the WHO s 7 billion budget Bhakdi told The Defender We feel that the plasmid discovery could be the game changer because genome alteration leads to the creation of genetically modified humans which he said will not be tolerated by the world Physicians around the globe face the decision whether they want to save themselves or go down in history as accomplices in the greatest crime against humanity We believe that here lies a real chance Bkahdi said Up to 35 of mRNA vaccine contaminated with bacterial DNA Data and testimony presented Monday centered around McKernan s finding replicated by other researchers that up to 35 of the content of mRNA COVID 19 vaccines consists of DNA plasmids Plothe described plasmids as a circular ring of DNA in which elements via genetic modifications have been put in in order to produce the mRNAs Logically plasmids should not be in the vaccine because they re the production sites of mRNA and you certainly don t want them to be

Caude said The most frequent antibiotic resistant genes are plasmid born and are thus easily transferred into DNA Bacterial plasmid DNA is a really well known danger signal for the immune system Bridle said describing how it activates the immune system s bacteria fighting agents and causes inflammation Plasmid DNA is very robust and it can last a very long time Bridle added noting that if these DNA plasmids are further modified this opens the door to exacerbating another problem which is potentially prolonged expression of the spike protein in the body Trozzi said there are at least six or seven methods by which foreign DNA can potentially be incorporated into human chromosomes adding that it s not in any way hyperbolic to talk about the genetic invasion of innocent people without their knowledge How mRNA is made with plasmids Bhakdi explained how this process takes place within the body The genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell the books of life that are safeguarded in the cell nucleus he said describing mRNA as the copied recipe of these instructions Vaccines are such short lived copies of chromosomal recipes that direct the production of selected antigens like the spike protein Because mass production of mRNA requires mass availability of the DNA templates more than 1 billion copies are administered with each injection into the human body Bhakdi said this is achieved through the billions and trillions of copies of the DNA derived from bacteria The recipes for viral proteins are contained in minute bacterial chromosomes that are inserted into plasmids which then multiply Subsequently The plasmids are harvested and used as templates for production of the RNA copies Bhakdi said describing how the RNA molecules are then packaged into tiny fatty globules termed lipid nanoparticles LNP The packaging material is essential to protect RNA from destruction so that it can travel in the bloodstream to reach all organs of the body Bhakdi said The LNP act as Trojan horses according to Bhakdi They re taken up by the cells their cargo is released and the recipes direct the production of the gene product he said Rose likened this

vaccine made with process one which used PCR to make the DNA that was then turned into the RNA to make the spike protein McKernan explained However Once the trial was complete they performed a big bait and switch he said They moved to a production process that manufactured this DNA in E coli With that comes a different risk McKernan said When they switched to scale this up now you had to get the DNA out of E coli and not have any of the parts of E coli come with it McKernan explained that parts of E coli are known endotoxins that can cause anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction Bhakdi said Contamination of mRNA vaccines with plasmid DNA must be expected to be the rule and not the exception SV40 DNA the most striking revelation McKernan discussed the most striking revelation SV40 cancer promoting components found in the Pfizer monovalent vaccines These were not disclosed to the regulators he said This is important McKernan said because SV40 is a well published tool for gene therapy If you want to get DNA into the nucleus this is the shuttle that you use to get it done According to McCullough SV40 stands for Simian Virus 40 These are known commercial enhancers to upregulate the production of a gene in E coli to produce a product he said The SV40 genetic code is well known to be taken up into human cells and to potentially cause cancer It promotes proto oncogenes to turn on and actually become cancerous within cells McCullough said Lindsay called SV40 a super promoter explaining that SV40 is great at driving gene expression and if that should sit above an oncogene of course you could have an explosion of an amplification in a cancer gene McKernan added If you have lipid nanoparticles that are encapsulating this material you now have a Trojan horse to get into the cells Here s the testimony by two scientists to the S Carolina Senate on Sept 16 regarding plasmid DNA contamination from the manufacturing process found in the Pfizer Moderna

Canada through a Freedom of Information request showed that plasmid DNA is not listed as an ingredient in mRNA vaccines Anybody who s received plasmid DNA in these shots they have never given informed consent for that he said Those of us who know the manufacturing process were assured that there would not be plasmid DNA present Bridle said this should have been easy for regulators to notice He described serving on the advisory committee of a master s student working on producing a preclinical messenger RNA based vaccine One single rookie scientist had no problem getting rid of these bacterial DNA contaminants he said There s no excuse for companies like Pfizer and Moderna with all of their money and all of their expert scientists to leave the plasmid DNA in the vaccines Bridle said The fact that they didn t get rid of this is egregious Rose said that since we have evidence that there is DNA in the COVID 19 modified mRNA injections then these products because there is a likelihood of integration via nuclear location sequences by any and all definitions qualify as gene therapies Even if this wasn t the intended design this is the result that we re facing right now she said adding that The potential for cancer is clear here and given the rise in reporting rate in VAERS over the past 3 years combined with the decrease in shot administration number we really must investigate the possible relationship between this rise in cancer reporting in the context of the COVID injections and the DNA contamination Injected individuals should have their stem cells and other cells checked for contaminant components What happens when the plasmid DNA from these plasmids broken up or intact gets into the nucleus of the cell Lindsay asked You can get DNA mutation and that can occur through substitutions through deletions Gene therapies may contaminate gene pool pass to children Lindsay said an additional concern regarding the COVID 19 vaccines is that the gene therapies would be passed on to progeny and cause contamination of the gene pool noting that there are mechanisms through which this can occur such as through sperm mediated gene transfer or through actual

testes My very large concern is that these gene therapies will be passed on to our progeny and will contaminate the gene pool Lindsay said This is not being investigated at all and I have reached out to multiple labs asking them if they would investigate this The vaccines accumulate in the reproductive organs and this could immediately impair fertility uptake and result in stillbirth Bhakdi said Bhakdi explained how placental damage may also enable the packaged genes to enter fetal circulation Indeed it is known that stem cells in umbilical cord blood are reduced and impaired following vaccination he said Bhakdi described the possible consequences as an unending disruption of the exquisitely tuned network that controls cell division and differentiation that could lead to cancer developmental defects and altered traits Plasmid DNA can produce chronic inflammation a key driver of cancers Panelists said that one of the dangers of such therapies is the risk of cancer Bridle said that plasmid DNA can be very long lived and that their long term presence causes cells of the immune system to be activated and produce or promote chronic inflammation a key driver of cancers McKernan said that while we are always cancering it s just when mutagenesis outpaces the immune system that you begin to notice it Increasing the DNA alone may not do it he said but a chronic disruption to the immune system of the type observed with COVID 19 vaccines can be a real potent combination McKernan also referred to data derived from Massachusetts death records showing a steady increase in cancer He said That is a clear cut sign that we have an increase in cancer post vaccination adding that this is really really potent data that I think should be at the forefront of any case we take forward

is also the trigger of many many autoimmune diseases he said McCullough said that the COVID 19 vaccines affect the body s tumor surveillance systems noting that if there are already mutations that weaken those tumor surveillance systems those mutations are known to predispose people to cancer He added that modified RNA is foreign to the human body noting that administering repeated doses of messenger RNA would impair our body s ability to repair a mutation in the body therefore setting up that cell to potentially convert into a cancer cell McCullough said there is now a sufficient body of knowledge demonstrating that COVID 19 vaccines can cause cancer noting that rates of cancer are up in every single cancer surveillance system adding that Now we have the situation where multiple administrations of a COVID 19 vaccine could accelerate cancer progression I think there s probably no better term that s come up for the concern here than turbo cancer he said Rose said that cancer reports are on the uprise since COVID 19 vaccination began Yet according to McCullough None of the cancer surveillance systems have merged this with vaccine administration Trozzi said the LNPs are also toxic That s one of the reasons that this injection causes such a higher degree of anaphylactic shock than non mRNA vaccines did he said adding that also we have the effects of it damaging the DNA repair mechanisms and that s impairing tumor suppression Rose said that potential severe adverse effects of LNPs include anaphylaxis sepsis toxic shock and death Henrion Caude noted that it is not just mRNA vaccines that pose a risk saying that in adenovirus based COVID 19 vaccines such as Johnson Johnson s and AstraZeneca s the adenoviruses may enable integration of DNA fragments adding that such capsules with fragments of DNA may lead to cancer metastasis Spike protein causes blood clots strokes sudden death Bhakdi said that the immune system is good at recognizing and eliminating

multi organ inflammation was detected in the vaccinated weeks and even months after the injections he said This was associated with severe and often fatal illness McCullough said that the spike protein has been found to cause cardiovascular disease and heart inflammation and accelerates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that causes stroke It can also cause Guillain Barré syndrome small fiber neuropathy and hearing and vision loss he said The spike protein is also found in blood clots according to McCullough blood clots like we ve never seen before resistant to anticoagulation and causing immune abnormalities such as vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and multisystem inflammatory disorder he added Continued production of any non cell protein will provoke long term inflammation

the UK s Office of National Statistics Information on 30 million adults in California and New York three fourths of whom were vaccinated were used to compare COVID hospitalization and case rates in those who were vaccinated and had no prior COVID illness with adults who were never vaccinated but had recovered from COVID and presumably had natural immunity The data were collected from June to November 2021 before the Omicron wave appeared The Defender reported on this data two months ago Vaccinated Californians and New Yorkers were three times more likely to develop COVID than those who had prior immunity and were unvaccinated Vaccinated Californians had a higher rate of hospitalizations severe illness than those who were unvaccinated but had prior immunity New York did not provide hospitalization data The vaccine failures in this huge study cannot be blamed on Omicron because the data were collected during Delta The UK data from its Office of National Statistics published March

includes 86 of all deaths in England which has a population of 56 million during the 13 months described The graphs reveal that being doubly vaccinated protected the English against death for most of 2021 However over last December and January corresponding to the Omicron wave COVID death rates in the doubly vaccinated but unboosted were higher than in those who had never been vaccinated This was true for the population as a whole If you break down the deaths by age group the vast majority of COVID deaths occurred in the over 70 population While deaths from COVID in younger people were trending up as the time since vaccination increased by Jan 31 2022 they had not exceeded COVID deaths in the unvaccinated Boosters did appear to top up COVID immunity for a time in all age groups reducing death rates But one wonders how long it will take before this effect wears off What is the bottom line High quality official data obtained on more than 30 million American adults and 48 million residents of England incontrovertibly reveal that Natural immunity was three times better at preventing cases than vaccination alone even before Omicron Natural immunity was somewhat better at preventing serious illness measured as hospitalizations than vaccination alone even before Omicron Boosters a third shot reduced the death rate in England of those vaccinated against Omicron but the benefit was starting to drop off by January 2022 Overall England s unvaccinated population had a lower COVID death rate during the Omicron wave than the COVID death rate in its doubly vaccinated population Walensky and the other so called experts are wrong Natural immunity provided three times more protection against infection and therefore against transmission than did double vaccination even before Omicron After Omicron vaccine efficacy was even worse While vaccination provided some protection against severe illness measured as hospitalizations during the Delta wave it provided less protection than natural immunity The vast majority of COVID deaths occur in those over 70 In this age group the doubly vaccinated died from COVID at higher rates during Omicron than the unvaccinated

COVID 19 shots over 36 months This compares to 52 reported cases following flu vaccination and 282 cases for all vaccines over the past 34 years According to the study this represents an alarming breach in the safety signal threshold concerning cerebral thrombosis adverse events following COVID 19 vaccination The study s authors independent researcher Claire Rogers obstetrician and gynecologist Dr James A Thorp independent researcher Kirstin Cosgrove and cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough used data from the U S government s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS for their analysis The data also indicated 9 821 reports of atrial fibrillation an irregular heart rhythm that is the most common identifiable cause of cerebral arterial thromboembolism following COVID 19 vaccination in 41 months compared to 797 cases reported in 34 years for all other vaccines combined Rogers told The Defender the findings confirm anecdotal evidence of an increased incidence of stroke seen during and after the COVID 19 pandemic Rogers said Cerebral thrombosis case reports in VAERS substantially increased after the COVID vaccines Not only have clinicians witnessed this in the hospital setting but the average citizen has seen increased reports of stroke in celebrities athletes and young people McCullough told The Defender the study employed a reasonable vaccine safety research strategy by comparing a new vaccine to the routine influenza vaccination as a safe standard He said the results showed horrific outcomes following COVID 19 vaccination These outcomes led the

the first priority for the next administration Spike protein implicated in increased stroke risk According to the study the spike protein found in the SARS CoV 2 virus and COVID 19 vaccines is likely a significant contributor to brain clots and strokes Early in the COVID pandemic it became evident that there was a thrombogenic effect of the Sars CoV 2 virus and it is now believed that the spike proteins are one of the major contributors to this thrombogenic effect the study said According to the study the original strain of the virus led to a variety of severe thromboembolic events However over time natural evolution may have resulted in less virulent strains This original risk was replaced by an increase in the incidence of microclots affecting the smaller vessels in the circulatory system The study noted that it is widely understood that cumulative exposure to the spike protein leads to an increased risk of such clots in patients According to Rogers One mechanism by which the spike protein is thought to contribute to this pathogenesis is by triggering endothelial dysfunction a condition that exists when coronary arteries are constricted even though there isn t a physical blockage The study did not compare the different COVID 19 vaccine types the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and the Johnson Johnson Janssen and AstraZeneca adenovirus based vaccines Rogers noted though that the adenovirus vaccines were withdrawn in the U S and Europe following reports of blood clots Noting that VAERS is regulated owned and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA the study addressed the relative advantages and disadvantages of using this database for such an analysis Despite the bias of the CDC FDA and their attempts to hide conceal and throttle the deaths and injuries caused by the COVID 19 vaccines there remains an unprecedented breach of the safety signal using their own criteria the study said This safety signal is evident even though the relative underreporting factor in VAERS is thought to be in the range of 30 100 A 2011 Harvard study found that less than 1 of all adverse events are

researchers studied 30 female Wistar albino rats split into mRNA non mRNA and control groups The rats in the vaccine groups received two human equivalent doses 28 days apart Four weeks after administration of the second dose the rats ovarian tissues were harvested and analyzed The results showed that both the mRNA and non mRNA COVID 19 vaccines may detrimentally impact ovarian reserve in

journal Frontiers in Physiology defines primordial follicles as the basic functional unit of female reproduction formed near the time of birth and subsequently remaining in a dormant state The quantity of primordial follicles plays a significant role in determining the length of a woman s ovarian lifespan and fertility According to a 2015 article in Biology of Reproduction This reserve contains all of the oocytes or developing eggs potentially available for fertilization throughout the fertile lifespan The study s results showed that the number of follicles that reached increasingly mature stages of development including primary secondary antral preovulatory and atretic follicles was typically significantly lower in both of the vaccinated groups and particularly in the mRNA group Commenting on the applicability of the study s results to humans Dr Angus Dalgleish professor of oncology at St George s University of London said rat studies such as the one conducted by the Turkish researchers are a standard and very reliable model for evaluating fertility issues Study shows mRNA vaccines and their lipid nanoparticles are highly toxic Aside from the decline in ovarian follicles measured in the Turkish study the results also showed other negative reproductive health outcomes in the vaccinated groups One such outcome was a decline in Anti Müllerian Hormone AMH which is representative of ovarian reserve or the quantity of oocytes in the ovary Lower levels of AMH are associated with poor fertility outcomes and earlier menopause Hulscher wrote The results also showed increased levels of caspase 3 an enzyme crucial in the death of cells according to Science Direct Hulscher noted that inflammatory markers were also found in the vaccinated groups that are associated with conditions including Ovarian atresia where a follicle fails to develop Fibrosis or the replacement of functional tissue with excess fibrous connective tissue leading to reduced organ function organ failure and death Long term tissue damage These effects were particularly pronounced in the mRNA vaccinated group Dalgleish said the contents of the mRNA vaccines likely contribute to this outcome The main message from this paper is that mRNA vaccines and their lipid nanoparticles are highly toxic in their own right being worse than the inactivated spike protein alone Dalgleish said

on a daily basis the higher the relative risk of abnormal symptoms This was not our finding The analyses of the proximity dyad of Partner Live with vaccinated person vs Seldom Sometimes Daily outside 6 feet revealed an unexpected significant protective effect for heavy menstrual clotting of the closest day to day exposure with a vaccinated partner cohabitating companion However the significant and highest relative risk across several symptoms including heavier bleeding 34 early period onset 28 and extended bleeding 26 was for those who were exposed to the vaccinated daily and within 6 feet but outside of the household One possible explanation for this result is that daily exposure to a larger public group of vaccinated individuals could increase the concentration and duration of exposure to

MyCycleStory survey was created she said It was imperative to capture these testimonies and bring the desperately needed conversation back to life The 91 question survey aimed at understanding and quantifying women s menstrual experiences during the COVID 19 vaccine rollout More than 6 000 women completed the survey from May 16 2021 to December 31 2021 They were 18 85 years old with an average age of 38 years The researchers focused their analyses on the 3 390 survey respondents who said they did not get a COVID 19 vaccine A limitation of the study is that it uses self reported data which some researchers have found to be less reliable than other types of data The people who are self reporting in this case the women who completed the survey could be biased in their recall of events

with the general trend of women being more susceptible to autoimmune diseases compared to men the authors noted The average age of men diagnosed with post vaccination autoimmune diseases was around 44 For women it was approximately 41 Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones The immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland leading to inflammation and overproduction of thyroid hormones Common symptoms include weight loss rapid heartbeat irritability and eye problems known as Graves ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy Subacute thyroiditis also known as de Quervain thyroiditis is a temporary inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland It typically presents with a painful tender and enlarged thyroid gland along with symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as weight loss rapid heartbeat and heat intolerance As the inflammation subsides patients may experience a period of hypothyroidism before the thyroid function returns to normal About 80 of people in the U S have received at least one dose of the COVID 19 vaccine with about 70 considered fully vaccinated according

mink and bear causing isolated human deaths and wreaking economic havoc in the U S poultry industry and among American egg consumers The World Health Organization WHO said H5N1 outbreaks have caused devastation in animal populations including poultry wild birds and some mammals and harmed farmers livelihoods and the food trade and pose ongoing risks to humans By 2022 deadly H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds had occurred in 67 countries in five continents with more than 131 million domestic poultry lost due to death or culling in affected farms and villages Another 14 outbreaks were reported this year mostly in the Americas By March the largest bird flu outbreak in U S history had struck the American poultry industry leading to the deaths of millions of chickens higher egg prices

Hong Kong and caused the Hong Kong flu pandemic with an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide and about 100 000 in the U S The Spanish i nfluenza H1N1 pandemic of 1918 1919 killed an estimated 50 100 million people worldwide a widely accepted figure the CDC supports though recent scholarship suggests the death toll while major was under 25 million The Spanish flu virus was not isolated during 1918 1919 the CDC said but when the technology was available the genetic sequence was later determined to be an avian like H1N1 virus No such thing as an easy button for influenza Using the gene editing tool CRISPR the researchers were able to change the chickens DNA and alter the genetic code by targeting a specific chicken gene that makes the ANP32A protein which the bird flu hijacks to replicate itself The goal was to make it impossible for the bird flu virus to take over the ANP32A protein and make copies of itself thus preventing the virus from replicating in the chickens The control group of 10 chickens that were not genetically altered and the gene edited group of 10 chickens were both sprayed with a dose of bird flu virus into their nasal passages The researchers used a milder dose

sloppy and cited several outright errors she said reviewers should have caught She pointed out that the authors confused the roles of different regulatory agencies provided incorrect citations for some of their model input numbers and sometimes used outdated cost estimates To estimate the effects of ending water fluoridation the authors created a nationally representative sample using data from 8 484 children from birth through age 19 The data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which is conducted each year by the CDC and is based on interviews about diet and details from people s health records The study authors used current water fluoridation levels as a proxy for how much fluoride children are exposed to then predicted the increase in cavities that would occur if that were to stop Their model predicted two scenarios if every public water system fluoridated its water at today s recommended level of 0 7 milligrams per liter and if there were a total national ban Experts questioned the use of fluoride in water as a proxy for exposure given that children are exposed to fluoride from many sources other than drinking water including toothpaste and all processed foods and drinks made with fluoridated water They also criticized the total ban scenario in which the researchers estimated that fluoride levels would be reduced to zero in all systems According to the CDC almost all water contains some naturally occurring fluoride so the zero fluoride estimate scenario can t occur It was also assumed that children benefit from drinking fluoridated water but Thiessen said there is no basis for this assumption We badly need some honest and thorough evaluation of whether there is a benefit or not from fluoride or fluoridation she said

repair he said meaning that ending fluoridation offers potential savings of 18 75 to 187 5 billion dollars America would drastically reduce the dental fluorosis epidemic in the U S if all the states banned water fluoridation Thiessen also noted that the authors disregarded other costs borne by the American public associated with water fluoridation including the costs of fluoridating and the costs

leading to live birth nine months later for women who received the COVID 19 vaccine was substantially lower than for unvaccinated women according to a new peer reviewed study Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for Children s Health Defense CHD called the study s conclusions alarming He said This preliminary analysis shows that much more information is needed to understand both short and long term implications of the different types of COVID shots on fertility and pregnancy parameters This information should have been obtained prior to any public use of the COVID vaccine The results showed that by June 2021 approximately six months after COVID 19 vaccines became available to the public successful conceptions per 1 000 women were considerably lower for vaccinated women than for those not vaccinated The researchers observed an increase in the rate of successful conceptions for unvaccinated women beginning in June 2021 which was maintained over the subsequent 6 month period In 2022 the rate of successful conceptions stabilized among both vaccinated and unvaccinated women but remained about 1 5 times higher for the latter group Troubling results indicate long term impact on reproductive health The preliminary analysis by five researchers from the Czech Republic Denmark and Sweden was published last week in the International Journal of Risk Safety in Medicine The study examined data obtained from the Czech Republic one of the few countries where nationwide birth data for women who were vaccinated or unvaccinated for COVID 19 are available the authors said The researchers analyzed data on 1 3 million women ages 18 39 between January 2021 and December 2023 The authors said their reasons for undertaking the study included existing research showing that COVID 19 vaccines have adverse effects on menstrual characteristics and the lack of data on the effect of COVID 19 vaccines on birth rates Data from several countries had shown decreased birth rates during

BioNTech or Moderna vaccines with 11 times more women receiving Pfizer s vaccine compared to Moderna s Multiple studies link COVID vaccines and reproductive problems The researchers noted the relationship between vaccination and fertility is not necessarily causal and some women may have based their decision to get vaccinated on whether they planned to become pregnant a possible example of self selection bias However the researchers pointed out that during the pandemic the overall fertility rate in the Czech Republic declined During that time Czech public health authorities recommended that pregnant women get vaccinated a recommendation the researchers said many women likely followed These factors reduce the likelihood that self selection bias accounts for the difference in successful conception rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated women Other recent studies have also found an association between COVID 19 vaccines and reproductive problems A peer reviewed study published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth in April found that among pregnant women who tested positive for COVID 19 those who received a COVID 19 vaccine were significantly more likely to miscarry

always happy her father said The first sign of illness appeared when she began getting sick with her tonsils That lasted a week or two The family had planned a trip to Mexico We were going to leave

eyes became red and sore When the family returned home her symptoms worsened until her breathing started getting bad and we went and picked up the oxygen machine Hildebrand said The family first took her to a hospital in Seminole on Jan 13 where she was diagnosed with strep throat and also mononucleosis The doctor gave her a steroid shot and sent her home Over the following weeks things just started going downhill from there Hildebrand said That s when we had to go to Covenant Hospital releases Daisy while sick with pneumonia without at home antibiotics On March 18 at Covenant Children s Hospital in Lubbock doctors diagnosed Daisy with community aquired pneumonia and placed her on two different antibiotics said Hooker who reviewed Daisy s medical records At that time she was not diagnosed with measles The next day Covenant released Daisy saying she still had pneumonia but that it was something the parent could treat at home However the staff did not instruct Daisy to continue with antibiotics and did not give her other treatments such as steroids to use at home That was kind of weird to me Hildebrand said I mean we went to the hospital to get her treated so she would be better Daisy didn t get better at home Disappointed with the care she had received at Covenant her parents took her to UMC on March 21 She was quickly admitted to the intensive care unit ICU where she was given antibiotics and some steroids The parents repeatedly requested she be given budesonide a steroid used to relieve inflammation affecting the airways but the hospital refused They just kept saying that the other breathing treatment was better and I didn t believe it Hildebrand said On March 24 UMC diagnosed Daisy with measles using a PCR test The same day the hospital released her Then it just got worse again Hildebrand said So we went to Dr Phil Claybrooke in Midland Texas So focused on the measles they didn t think about testing for anything else Claybrooke told them to take Daisy to the emergency room because she needed higher technology oxygen support than he was able to provide On March 27 Daisy was readmitted to UMC The staff put her on what Hildebrand called a high

everything on the measles They were so focused on the measles that they didn t think about testing for anything else and that is why my daughter is dead today As The Defender reported it wasn t until days into her second UMC stay that the staff did what s called a sputum culture to identify the specific bacteria fungi or other germs in her lungs The test showed Daisy s lungs had an E coli bacteria

to stabilize their consistency even though a large and growing body of research shows some emulsifiers are linked to health problems according to a recent investigation by KFF Health News Studies have found that emulsifiers can alter the mix of bacteria in the gut known as the microbiome or microbiota damage the lining of the gastrointestinal tract and trigger inflammation potentially contributing to problems elsewhere in the body according to KFF KFF s investigation consulted experts globally who argued that emulsifiers should be eliminated from processed foods or that it may be prudent to limit intake of some of the most toxic ones like polysorbate 80 PS 80 and that doing so might eliminate debilitating symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel diseases But what KFF didn t note in its investigation and what food experts on emulsifiers don t address is that PS 80 is also commonly used as an excipient in vaccines It s also added as an inactive ingredient to many slow release drugs like aspirin and Tylenol to help stabilize the drugs It s even found in some skincare products The Children s Hospital of Philadelphia s CHOP Vaccine Education Center which promotes vaccines as safe and effective reports that PS 80 is present in 22 vaccines given to children or pregnant women CHOP says that people are exposed to PS 80 in many products including lotions makeup shampoos and

playing catch up on food science often leaving consumers to discern for themselves whether to ingest harmful compounds like PS 80 However when processed food makers first started using emulsifiers the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA wasn t looking at possible effects on gut health Dr Robert Califf former head of the FDA said the standards on emulsifiers didn t consider such adverse effects and need to be updated KFF called for more clinical trials in humans to study food additives and their effects on human health Unsafe to ingest but safe to inject PS 80 is commonly added to vaccines as a stabilizer It can also be a residual byproduct of the manufacturing process In recent years a range of issues and safety concerns have arisen about PS 80 s use in biopharmaceutical products according to research published in CrystEngComm prompting some scientists to call for more research into its potential toxic effects Polysorbates have slipped under the radar in part because they belong to an old class of chemicals that began to be patented in the 1940s when modern methods weren t yet available to analyze their molecular composition Since then their performance and stability have been largely taken for granted As a result there haven t been many studies into its potential toxic effects as a pharmaceutical ingredient However recent research indicates that the composition of polysorbates is more highly variable than previously thought they can contain up to 355 different compounds The variation of components in different batches of any given polysorbate can range widely and they are prone to degradation which can lead to the formation of several unanticipated by products Research also shows PS 80 crosses the blood brain barrier and injections containing the substance

Underdeveloped liver enzyme pathways in some infants may make it harder for them to process toxic ingredients in vaccines a condition that could lead to sudden infant death syndrome SIDS according to a new study published in the International Journal of Medical Sciences Those pathways play a role in metabolizing PS 80 and other excipients the researchers noted Compounds like PS 80 in vaccines have been flagged for their ability to cross react with other chemicals and produce immediate hypersensitivity reactions a type of exaggerated or inappropriate immune response that can include anaphylaxis Research also shows that in animals PS 80 is more toxic when injected compared to oral administration Research showed weak toxicity when given orally but when it was administered intravenously it caused a range of symptoms Jablonowski told The Defender While PS 80 is not absorbed very well when ingested it can cause leaky gut and the cascade of toxins and contaminants to enter the bloodstream This can cause inflammation Injecting PS 80 bypasses the natural barrier of the gastrointestinal tract and deposits it intramuscularly and eventually into the bloodstream causing symptoms that are not otherwise seen in ingestion trials Studies of pregnant mice showed that PS 80 taken orally caused changes to the microbiome of the mothers that in turn caused metabolic syndrome in their offspring

for it to be toxic Reassuring the public by drawing a false distinction between aluminum salts and elemental aluminum is rhetorical obfuscation said James Lyons Weiler Ph D founder of IPAK EDU an adult online institution of higher learning It is like saying mercury in thimerosal isn t mercury According to Lyons Weiler aluminum salts are not inert They are used as vaccine adjuvants because of their biological activity They kill cells bind to antigens provoke immune activation and persist in tissue In fact he said these salts are more bioavailable than elemental aluminum because they dissolve in bodily fluids and are actively taken up by immune cells He added The adjuvants used in vaccines are well documented to migrate accumulate and persist especially in infants whose renal clearance is immature Numerous studies human animal and mechanistic demonstrate that aluminum adjuvants can access the brain disrupt cytokine signaling and impair development Some aluminum salts

The authors of a Danish study published July 15 said they found no link between the aluminum in vaccines and autism However two scientists who reviewed the study including corrected data published July 17 said the data don t support the authors conclusion By Tomas Fürst Few issues of contemporary science are more contentious than the relation between childhood vaccines and adverse health outcomes So whenever a new study appears it attracts a lot of attention See the new study by Andersson et al titled Aluminum Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood A Nationwide Cohort Study which appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine in July Conclusion Cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed We went through the paper left no stone unturned and report that we do not like what we found 1 First there is the issue of the evolving supplement The original supplement included data on 2 239 neurodevelopmental events such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD but it is no longer accessible It has been replaced by a revised version that now reports 5 200 neurodevelopmental events see Table 11 of the supplement This increase in the number of events altered the confidence intervals and the updated data now show a statistically significant association between certain neurodevelopmental outcomes particularly autism and ADHD and aluminum exposure from vaccines This finding directly contradicts the paper s conclusion which states Cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed See also the article at Children s Health Defense 2 The study suffers from a major limitation due to its short follow up period In Denmark children are typically diagnosed with autism autism spectrum disorders and ADHD between the ages of 7 and 12 or even later depending on the severity of symptoms However the authors only tracked the children up to age 5 virtually ensuring that many relevant outcomes were missed Therefore even if the study had not found an association between aluminum exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes which in fact it had see No 1 above the authors still would not have been in a position to conclude that no such association exists Nevertheless the corresponding author Anders Hviid publicly misrepresented the findings claiming that the study showed there was no link between aluminum exposure and

years not have emigrated from Denmark not have been diagnosed with certain congenital or preexisting conditions including congenital rubella syndrome respiratory conditions primary immune deficiency and heart or liver failure However death may be linked to vaccination Moreover many of the listed preexisting conditions may be in fact adverse events of previous vaccines Thus if the authors exclude many children who had been harmed by vaccines they may miss some effects entirely We would like to see the analysis with no children excluded 4 Adjusting for the number of office visits pre 2 years of age may mask the effect significantly Office visits are a proxy for the outcome children who end up with some diagnosis probably visited GPs more often Thus there is a risk that the effect will be adjusted away To give an example if we want to measure the effect of an intervention on blood flow through the left arm we should not adjust for blood flow in the right arm These two quantities are very probably correlated and adjusting for one will probably adjust much of the effect away 5 According to Figure 1 more than 34 000 children were excluded because they had implausibly many registered vaccines in the first 2 years of life Why would that be This casts serious doubt on the integrity of the data Also Figure 1 says that between 0 and 466 000 children were excluded from some analyses because they had the outcome in the first 2 years of life What does that mean We do not understand Figure 1 and the supplementary material to which Figure 1 refers does not help 6 Measles mumps rubella or MMR vaccines allegedly contain no aluminum So recipients of MMR vaccines only are in the control group together with recipients of no vaccines at all This makes the control group rather

relatives something Dr Donald Davis an expert on the history of the American Chestnut called a massive and irreversible experiment More recent statements by TACF have revealed that it was not merely because of significant performance limitations of the Darling progeny that TACF has withdrawn its support but also because they have been working with the wrong GE Tree The TACF press release explained that a significant identity error in the propagation materials supplied to TACF had occurred and that independent confirmation now shows all pollen and trees used for this research was derived not from Darling 58 Throughout the regulatory process no one noticed that they were working with the wrong tree Not since cold fusion has so much scientific hype been generated around a fundamental error Frankly it strains credulity that the federal government was so close to making such a monumental precedent setting regulatory decision based on misinformation This should call into question any and all claims by SUNY ESF about their GE tree research and disqualify this and future petitions by them The Campaign to STOP GE Trees has for years argued that the Darling 58 is a Trojan

is now the responsibility of those outlets to let the public know that the unparalleled support for the GE tree was misplaced and that the silvicultural messiah was less than all that We will continue to echo the warnings of scientists who urge caution such as TACF s former staff geneticist Dr Paul Sisko who said that there needs to be 50 years of testing prior to release given that the trees are long lived organisms Sisko also expressed concern that since only young trees were tested they do not know whether these genes will have unintended side effects on the trees or the organisms that interact with the trees as they mature In fact one of the reasons TACF stated for withdrawing its support was poor performance as the trees matured This underscores the impossible task of understanding the impacts of introducing long lived organisms into the wild not to mention researching the wrong variant As the promise of the Darling 58 withers on the proverbial vine it should be a

for the emergency use COVID vaccines Accurate risk profiles allow regulators to determine if a medical intervention is causing more harm than good and consumers to make rational choices about their own use of a product Regulators usually develop risk assessments during preclinical trials by comparing health outcomes in individuals receiving the intervention against a placebo group Such studies must be large enough to detect rare injuries and of sufficient duration to reveal ailments with long diagnosis horizons The existence of the placebo group makes it difficult to conceal or misattribute

too familiar vaccine propaganda playbook The routine of reflexively dismissing suspicious deaths and injuries as unrelated to vaccination not only calls into doubt the official data tallies on vaccine injuries it also contrasts markedly with the habit among public health officials of authoritatively attributing every death to COVID 19 so long as the deceased tested positive for COVID within 60 days of death using a PCR test notorious for producing false positives In fact the 48 billion COVID vaccine enterprise shares three defining features with every new vaccine introduced since 1986 1

actually killed them The average deceased had 2 8 comorbidities Yet in CDC s official tabulations CDC always presumes that COVID 19 did the killing But as we see from the examples above when it comes to COVID vaccine injuries the opposite presumption governs the comorbidity is always the cause of death even when as with Dr Michaels there are no known comorbidities 2 Systematic exaggeration of vaccine efficacy Pfizer touts a 95 efficacy rate in its clinical trials but this is a meaningless measure of relative efficacy based on a tiny cohort of 94 people in the placebo group who got mild

and largely inevitable This view has been reinforced by high profile studies press releases from research universities and public messaging by organizations such as the National Institutes of Health NIH But as the prevalence of autism continues to climb far beyond what genetic drift or selection pressure could plausibly account for the credibility of this paradigm has quietly eroded At his April 16 press conference U S Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr called this genetic focus a dead end not as a rhetorical flourish but as a reflection of decades of failed research investment He noted that NIH has historically spent 10 to 20 times more funding on genetic studies than on environmental causation despite genetic studies yielding no actionable prevention strategies and no therapies for reversal or mitigation Kennedy s administration plans to rebalance this ratio investing heavily in exploring environmental toxicological and iatrogenic risk factors that may explain the steep rise in autism rates over recent decades In my book The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism I showed that the science already provides an extensive evidence based dissection of the genetic determinist narrative and it is damning While acknowledging that certain genetic variants may contribute to autism risk the studies show that No single gene accounts for more than 1 of autism cases even in the most generous interpretations of genome wide association studies GWAS Most genetic risk loci lack replication across populations and suffer from methodological flaws including failure to control for environmental exposure or epigenetic activation Studies citing high heritability e g 64 91 conflate genetic inheritance with familial risk which includes shared environment and

for at least half of autism liability including gene environment interactions To illustrate the inadequacy of the genetics only model consider the missing heritability problem In theory if autism were primarily genetic then genome wide scans would reveal consistent high effect mutations Instead the findings have been underwhelming The largest GWAS to date has implicated hundreds of genes but each explains only a tiny fraction of risk The effect sizes are so small that they fail to distinguish autistic individuals from non autistic peers in clinical settings Many implicated genes are involved in basic neurodevelopmental processes which makes them non specific mutations in these same pathways are implicated in epilepsy attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD intellectual disability and even schizophrenia Moreover the research exposes a conceptual flaw that haunts much of this research the idea that increased autism prevalence must be genetic if it clusters in families In reality this ignores the growing literature on shared environmental toxicants maternal immune activation and iatrogenic exposures as intergenerational transmitters of risk In fact Kennedy recommends a more accurate term than genetic risk familial risk which captures both heritable and non heritable shared determinants Equally problematic is the overreliance on animal models that simulate autism by knocking out genes unrelated to any real world environmental context This leads to a circular trap identifying a gene mutation that causes autistic behavior in a mouse and then searching for that mutation in humans without asking whether the same phenotype can be induced by toxicant exposure in the absence of the mutation a phenomenon known as phenomimicry One striking example is the interaction of terbutaline a common obstetric drug used to delay labor with adrenergic receptors Connors et al 2005 found that overstimulation of these receptors mimics the effects of a genetic polymorphism known to be associated with autism resulting in the same neuroanatomical changes In this case environment mimics mutation This single insight demolishes the naive view that genes alone

preventing this parasitic infection The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis Infected cats defecate Toxoplasma eggs into the litter box garden or other places in the environment where they can be picked up by humans or other animals Water shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables can also harbor infectious parasite eggs In addition to eggs tissue cysts present in the meat of warm blooded

Between 30 and 50 of the world s population is permanently infected with Toxoplasma due to the many ways the parasite can spread Toxoplasma can target male reproductive organs Upon infection Toxoplasma spreads to virtually every organ and skeletal muscle Evidence that Toxoplasma can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced during the height of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s when some patients presented with the parasitic infection in their testes While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis it can also occur in otherwise healthy

toxoplasmosis and sperm quality Toxoplasma can directly damage human sperm Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in Toxoplasma infected mice rats and rams Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of abnormally shaped sperm In that April study researchers from Germany Uruguay and Chile observed that Toxoplasma can reach the testes and epididymis the tube where sperm mature and are stored two days after infection in mice This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite 22 4 of sperm cells were beheaded The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites Sperm cells that maintained their head were often twisted and

interview with Albert Benavides an expert on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS who took viewers on a deep dive into what s really going on with how vaccine related injuries and deaths are tallied Benavides founder of VAERSAware com analyzed numerous deficiencies in the VAERS system that he said contribute to the significant underreporting of deaths and serious adverse events Benavides who has an extensive background in HMO claims auditing data analytics medical billing and revenue cycle management also explained how two parallel VAERS systems operate with only one of these systems available to the public The public facing system does not contain updates made to VAERS reports after the initial reports were filed Benavides shared a presentation highlighting key findings he s identified by studying VAERS data arguing that many of these discrepancies in his opinion are intentional and hide the true extent of vaccine related deaths and adverse events VAERS data manipulated legitimate reports deleted Benavides said he s been able to identify over 30 000 reports related to the COVID 19 vaccines which have been deleted including 1 100 death reports that have been deleted I really believe that a lot of them are legitimate reports and should not have been deleted for being a duplicate nor were they fake or false reports because they re so professionally written and were submitted by a contactable physician Benavides said This is just one of the several ways in which VAERS data is manipulated he said There s over 100 000 severe adverse events that are technically classified as not serious noting that the threshold for classifying an adverse event as serious in VAERS is itself high with events classified below emergency considered not serious Many VAERS reports are also throttled meaning there was a delay between the filing time of the report and the time the report appeared in VAERS Benavides said In one example he cited 41 of the 999 death reports filed in VAERS over a 14 week period between Nov 18 2022 and Feb 17 2023 concerned instances where the person actually died in 2021 Benavides said This is indicative of the throttling the purposeful delay in publishing the results While Benavides said a lag time of four to six weeks was reasonable in order to authenticate claims he identified at least 100 000 reports where the delay exceeded 90", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:childrenshealthdefense.org_defender_defender-in-depth-podcast-albert-benavides.txt:0:70c3d030bd0b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 17254,

Benavides said a lag time of four to six weeks was reasonable in order to authenticate claims he identified at least 100 000 reports where the delay exceeded 90 days and numerous instances where the delay neared or exceeded two years In other instances Benavides said VAERS report filing dates were manipulated with reports appearing to have been submitted much later than they actually were Last week in real time they gave us 22 deaths where the people died in 2021 and they re just now telling us about it he said 30 of COVID vaccine reports list age unknown even if age is noted in summary Benavides also said he identified many mismatches in VAERS reports between COVID 19 vaccine lot numbers and the vaccine manufacturer listed in the report This is significant according to Benavides because It changes the dynamic Cross checking the data and assigning the vaccine numbers to the correct vaccine helps reveal for instance that certain lots may be more toxic than the data otherwise indicates Benavides said he identified thousands of such reports in the VAERS data and similarly approximately 50 000 instances where COVID 19 vaccine reports are listed with an unknown manufacturer even in cases where the vaccine manufacturer is clearly indicated in the report s accompanying written summary Another major disconnect according to Benavides is reports of serious adverse events such as cardiac arrest stroke or even death being listed in the written summary but because specific boxes were not checked off the report does not appear as a death or serious adverse event in the VAERS database Similarly Benavides said that 30 of all the COVID 19 reports in VAERS have an unknown age listed He said his analysis showed that a disproportionate number of these unknown age reports pertained to children and that in many cases the age of the victim was documented in the report s written summary A conventional search will retrieve 200 dead kids from 0 17 years old connected to the COVID 19 vaccines Benavides said His analysis however showed that in fact there s about 500 dead kids the other 300 you can t see because there s no age VAERS administrators purposely stripping out data According to Benavides VAERS administrators allow these errors to pass through and while some of them may be the result of a mistake or typo he believes overwhelmingly that VAERS administrators

Thiessen Ph D a leading fluoride expert joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss the latest science on water fluoridation Thiessen said it s taken decades but public attitudes are finally changing in favor of ending water fluoridation You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Kathy Thiessen Ph D a leading fluoride expert joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss a meta analysis published last week by the National Toxicology Program NTP concluding that that fluoride is a neurotoxicant in humans Thiessen president and senior scientist at the Oak Ridge Center for Risk Analysis testified last year in a lawsuit against the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA A September 2024 federal court ruling in the case found that water fluoridation at current U S levels poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children The ruling requires the EPA to take regulatory action to address the risks of water fluoridation The agency which has until Jan 20 to appeal has not yet taken action Thiessen co authored a 2006 National Research Council report that addressed the toxic effects of fluoride and called for more research into its effects Thiessen said the new meta analysis and a previous NTP report show that fluoride is a neurotoxicant in humans and as fluoride exposure is increased the likelihood of reduced IQ and some other cognitive deficits increases According to Thiessen exposure to fluoride during pregnancy harms the fetus Fluoride crosses the placenta so whatever the mother s fluoride exposure is the baby s going to be exposed to that And those risks continue after birth If the infant formula is made up with fluoridated tap water those babies get the largest dose per body weight of anybody in the population at an age when they re still developing Thiessen said Consistent body of literature shows fluoride is neurotoxic during development The NTP s latest meta analysis reviewed 74 epidemiological studies examining the link between children s IQ and fluoride exposure Thiessen said the number and quality of such studies has increased substantially in recent years When we wrote the 2006 report there were just a few studies of fluoride exposure and cognitive deficits Thiessen said Many of the most recent ones have been funded by our National Institutes of Health They are high quality studies Thiessen said the studies together form a very consistent body of literature showing that the fluoride is neurotoxic during development In the case of the NTP report and meta analysis however there were repeated efforts to block or delay their publication Thiessen said the lawsuit against the EPA filed by the Fluoride Action Network Moms Against Fluoridation and Food Water Watch along with individual parents and children in 2017 was instrumental in the public release of the NTP", "chunk_id":

court case the judge required them to be made public And we have that to be thankful for there Efforts to block or delay publication of the NTP s reports are part of a very long history of suppression and of adverse information about fluoridation Thiessen said Scientists raised concerns about water fluoridation as early as the 1940s when it first started Thiessen said From the 1940s on there have been vested interests of several sorts that have pushed for water fluoridation The EPA has ignored evidence of fluoride s risks Thiessen said I have said on record in the fluoride trial that if EPA had done its job responsibly even back in the 1980s we would not be having that case Thiessen added This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today There should simply be a national end to water fluoridation Thiessen responded to claims that fluoridation protects oral health and that it was one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century She said The real evidence shows that it s probably one of the 10 leading contributors to poor health in this country Thiessen referred to a 2024 Cochrane report finding that water fluoridation confers minimal benefits to public health She suggested that diet and other lifestyle factors are more significant determinants of oral health than fluoridation or lack of it There are studies showing that children in areas where it s a subsistence existence These kids have great teeth You have poor kids in this country whose diet is mostly sugar and no they re not going to have good teeth It s much more a matter of access to care and access to good nutrition Thiessen said Thiessen suggested children in poorer and rural populations are most likely to be adversely affected by fluoridation as their parents are more likely to bottle feed babies with baby formula mixed with tap water Thiessen said public attitudes toward water fluoridation are changing The tide has been turning slowly for 20 something years but we re",

Rob Verkerk Ph D founder executive and scientific director of the Alliance for Natural Health who joined host Michael Nevradakis Ph D to talk about censorship and how it affects people s access to reliable information about health We re in this war of information Verkerk said We re also in a war of values And right at the heart of this is our ability to express views If we can t express our views we don t have a democracy If we can t receive information about health we can t actually engage properly in self care Alliance for Natural Health last month launched the Free Speech 4 Health campaign and a petition asking YouTube to change its medical misinformation policy enacted in August 2023 Children s Health Defense CHD is one of the campaign s partners Verkerk discussed the campaign and petition and highlighted examples of Big Tech censorship of health related information and attempts by governments to criminalize such speech He also discussed the risk of artificial intelligence AI being weaponized to stifle online speech further We are on a very slippery slope Verkerk said he founded the Alliance for Natural Health in 2002 to protect the right to natural health noting that this right has been threatened for decades He said his organization has used a very specific technique of good science and good law including in six successful legal cases against the U S Food and Drug Administration However he said threats to natural health have grown as efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation have increased in recent years It s very easy for people to buy into this idea that control over misinformation is needed to protect you Verkerk said This is probably one of the biggest challenges we ve got the world over as we move to more and more global control As the locus of control moves from governments to Big Tech corporations the two are now almost inseparable Verkerk said YouTube and other platforms have embedded censorship into their official policies Verkerk said citing YouTube s incredibly draconian new medical misinformation policy The policy bans any health related content that isn t approved by authorities such as the National Institutes of

content it s also used to censor natural health content Verkerk said He gave examples of intermittent fasting and Keto diets which have been very heavily shadowbanned in recent months Verkerk said the central message of his organization s free speech campaign is that YouTube s medical misinformation policy is not fit for purpose and we want to see change People are getting ever more distorted information Verkerk said AI is right at the heart of it We have to start reassessing the First Amendment in the digital age but it s pretty hard to have a public debate on that when there is censorship Multiple governments have joined the act Verkerk said citing the European Union s Digital Services Act the U K s online safety law Ireland s hate speech law and a proposed French law that could criminalize criticism of government approved medical treatments They now argue that the whole of the alternative medicine space is a cult Verkerk said referring to France s proposed law And so they are proposing that anyone who suggests that a mainstream medical treatment is not appropriate and they give an alternative treatment in its place will be extremely heavily fined if not imprisoned

provisions that would lead to censorship of narratives not approved by the WHO The misinformation war that will be arbitrated by the WHO is a very significant part of the problem Verkerk said We are

Defender In Depth this week to discuss a new 50 country pandemic preparedness and surveillance partnership announced last week by the White House McCollough also discussed other recent troubling developments for privacy and personal autonomy McCollough said the new 50 country partnership is the latest in a long line of U S government surveillance initiatives that curtail Americans civil liberties He cited the recent renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 or FISA and legislation forcing Chinese owned TikTok to divest its U S operations as further examples McCollough also cited technological innovations such as blockchain technology as tools that have the potential to benefit humanity but which he says are increasingly being weaponized into tools of surveillance and control Very powerful controligarchs behind government surveillance plans Referring to the Biden administration s new global pandemic surveillance plan McCollough said This latest move is really just an effort by the current administration to go ahead and implement much of what is still in flux at the international level namely the World Health Organization s WHO proposed pandemic agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations In short the Biden administration is basically rushing forward with these agreements that everybody has been saying are really a bad idea McCollough said It s not just the U S government that s backing such plans McCollough warned He cited the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation as one of the primary drivers of such initiatives alongside a huge group of actors both government and then financial and nongovernmental organizations that are very much involved in all of this They include financial firms Vanguard BlackRock and State Street which McCollough said own a lot of the shares in the major tech companies and in Big Pharma You also have the Bilderberg Group the Atlantic Council the Trilateral Commission the Council

all these sorts of notions that people can normally get behind in service of a much larger objective The price however is individual self determination and liberty McCollough said We are all being reduced to chattel We will be moved about controlled stripped of all self determination by a group of elites Digital data used against us for propaganda purposes The elites are hijacking technologies and digital applications that have the potential to benefit humanity for their own benefit McCollough said Digital itself is not a bad thing McCollough said We all love our digital tools I m a technophile I love technology So it s not about the technology or the fact that it s digital it s that these tools are being used to bludgeon us He said such efforts preceded World War I when the U S government took over the telegraph and telecommunications systems In recent decades such initiatives have included then President Ronald Reagan s Executive Order 12333 which according to McCollough is the beginning of the use of digital technology to institute a surveillance state This was followed by former President George W Bush s administration s Total Information Awareness program allowing the government to capture all of the information it could And after the Sept 11 2001 attacks a whole host of security initiatives such as the Patriot Act followed which began to turn its focus against its own citizens McCollough said Now with all of the technology that we have and what the infrastructure can do every phone call every email every text everything you do on every device is captured stored associated with you and potentially there for data mining whether by government or private entities We have been stripped of our individual privacy rights They know everything about us It is freely available to government and these large corporate interests and it is being used against us for propaganda purposes or for psychological sales techniques to try to control what we buy and how we buy

McCollough cited FISA Section 701 which authorizes the collection of data He said That s what allows them to actually establish the wiretap Recent amendments to FISA expanded the base of what they call service providers who are now subject to an order by the federal government by the intelligence services or the FBI including virtual private network providers and businesses that offer WiFi access to their customers They can now tap into far more sources of information McCollough said All of us are being monitored and surveilled Over time they can find out everything about you and ultimately use it against you at their pleasure U S intelligence agencies seek foothold in TikTok via forced divesture McCollough said congressional action against TikTok is another step toward increased surveillance While he understands the concerns about a China controlled application that has access to children s personal information he said There s more going on than we are being told According to McCollough The real reason that they are doing this isn t to positively influence what social media does to our kids Our intelligence services dislike TikTok because they do not control TikTok like they do the social media platforms that were grown here in the United States the Facebooks and all of the others This is why they are making them divest They re making them sell to somebody controlled by the United States and even more specifically the United States intelligence services so that they will be the ones in control They don t like TikTok because they can t control TikTok That s the problem McCollough said the bill gives extraordinary power to the Executive Office of the President to deem virtually any entity whether social media or not a foreign threat which he says would allow the president to authorize their takeover It s really easy to deem someone a threat McCollough said noting that this can be done even on the basis of spreading alleged misinformation

Organization s WHO International Health Regulations IHR The revisions would allow the WHO to order global lockdowns travel restrictions or any other measures it sees fit to respond to nebulous potential public health risks the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS said in a press release The amendments passed at last year s World Health Assembly and set to take effect July 19 for all signatories would have been binding in the U S even though the U S withdrew from the WHO earlier this year While the proposals were watered down compared to earlier drafts they contained provisions that would have given the WHO unprecedented authority In a video released today Kennedy said the amendments were a step in the wrong direction that pose a threat to national sovereignty and facilitate the rollout of a global surveillance infrastructure and digital vaccine passports Kennedy said The new regulations employ extremely broad language that gives the WHO unprecedented power They require countries to establish systems of risk communications so that the WHO can implement unified public messaging globally That opens the door to the kind of narrative management and propaganda and censorship that we saw during the COVID pandemic Sayer Ji co founder of Stand for Health Freedom and chair of the Global Wellness Forum said the rejection of the amendments is a defining moment in human history that symbolizes the rejection of a worldview that reduces human beings to data points and treats constitutional protections as inconvenient obstacles to be circumvented The rejection sends a clarion call to the world that health freedom and national sovereignty remain non negotiable principles that cannot be sacrificed on the altar of technocratic expediency Ji said According to the joint statement the U S notified the WHO of its formal rejection of the amendments today In his video Kennedy said the U S was rejecting the amendments not only on

obligations in handling public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders according to the WHO The existing IHR allows the WHO director general to declare a public health emergency in any country without the consent of that country s government though it requires both sides to first attempt to reach an agreement Previous versions of the IHR have been in place since 1969 The current version was enacted in 2005 in the aftermath of SARS CoV 1 It is one of only two binding treaties achieved by the WHO the other being the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control HHS said the World Health Assembly passed the IHR amendments through a rushed process lacking sufficient debate and public input Kennedy highlighted several reasons for rejecting the amendments Nations that accept the new regulations are signing over their power in health emergencies to an unelected international organization that could order lockdowns travel restrictions or any other measures that it sees fit In fact it doesn t even need to declare an emergency Potential public health risks are enough for it to initiate action If we re going to give the WHO that much power we should at least invite a thorough public debate Kennedy said the amendments contain provisions relating to vaccine passports and the development of centralized medical databases It lays the groundwork for global medical surveillance of every human being he said Kennedy also said the WHO s response to COVID 19 showed that it shouldn t be trusted with more power During COVID the WHO failed to enforce the

physician biotech consultant and senior scholar at the Brownstone Institute said Kennedy s statement was very rational and a refreshing change from the usual jargon filled drivel that has been the main basis of support for the amendments Bell said the main problem with the amendments is the expansion of surveillance as they would be used to fuel unfounded fear of pandemics and thereby become a lever for lockdowns and border closures and then mandated vaccination with mRNA vaccines Nass said the amendments even if weakened still posed a threat to the global public They still strongly encourage nations to survey and censor their populations and they provide a framework for more insidious global control in the future Rubio said the amendments contained vague and broad language which focuses on political issues like solidarity rather than rapid and effective actions Rejection by U S provides moral courage for other nations In January President Donald Trump issued an executive order to withdraw the U S from the WHO a process which will be completed at the end of the year However according to the HHS State Department joint statement These amendments were set to become binding on the United States regardless of our withdrawal from the WHO This is because the IHR is considered a binding international treaty to which the U S is a signatory and which is listed in the State Department s list of Treaties in Force Membership of the IHR is separate from WHO The U S is still a signatory to the IHR just rejecting the new amendments Bell said In his video Kennedy said

in How to Design a Study That Proves No Danger by Hiding It A study by Danish researchers claiming no link between aluminum exposure from vaccines and autism or chronic disease was designed to hide any possible evidence of a connection The study illustrates why medical professionals can no longer simply read a study s abstract and results and trust that peer review will validate findings You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up In this article I will discuss a large study involving 1 2 million children published last week which examined the association between aluminum exposure from vaccines and chronic disease It has already been critiqued appropriately elsewhere I have written this summary of the study s failings for several colleagues in medicine who have recently asked my opinion In my opinion the study serves as an excellent example of why we as medical professionals can no longer simply read the abstract and results trusting that peer review will validate findings Let s say you were a researcher who was interested in knowing whether there was an association between aluminum exposure through vaccines and chronic diseases You have access to a huge database of vaccination records and health outcomes for each person in the database How would you approach the question The obvious approach would be to examine the health records of the kids who got the most vaccines and compare their health records to those who got none That would give you the best chance of detecting a risk if one existed Let s see how the authors of the recently published paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine Aluminum Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood A Nationwide Cohort Study put the question to rest The results made immediate headlines in legacy media which touted this study as even more proof that the aluminum in vaccines has no appreciable adverse effect on health Step 1 Deciding which children would be examined The older the children are the more vaccines they would have had so perhaps you would want to look at adolescents first right Instead the authors chose to only look at kids who received aluminum containing vaccines before the age of 2 Step 2 Deciding on the observational window The authors had access to records going back 28 years Instead of extending the observational period to age 10 or 15 they chose to examine health outcomes until the age of 5 in their primary analysis secondary analyses extended to age 8 Step 3 Deciding on the exclusion criteria Some kids were lost to follow up because they left the country Some children died before the age of 2 Some have incomplete medical records These kids were not included in their analysis That makes sense However the authors also chose to also exclude 35", "chunk_id":

547 children from their analysis because they received Too many registered vaccinations containing aluminum during their first 2 y of life These are the children they should be most interested in because if there was an association it would most likely manifest in this subgroup Wouldn t it make sense to analyze this group for health outcomes before excluding them so that they could justify their decision It would but the authors didn t do that Instead the authors explain that these kids received an implausible number of vaccines Why Because they received more vaccines than were recommended In other words the vaccination records must be inaccurate How do they know that Inherent in this assumption is that vaccination records may not always be accurate So they are applying a double standard These kids have inaccurate vaccination records but all those included don t Next the researchers also excluded children who were expressing symptoms of the very conditions they were looking for in their analysis before the age of 2 With regard to at least one of these conditions 466 047 kids were excluded How did they know that these kids were not the most susceptible to chronic diseases from aluminum toxicity They didn t Wouldn t it make sense to see what their aluminum exposure was It would but the authors didn t do any subgroup analysis to address this Step 4 Adjusting for confounders Properly adjusting for confounders is the most difficult challenge in retrospective studies like this one where a heterogeneous population is being analyzed There are subgroups who are more susceptible to the outcomes being examined than others for reasons other than aluminum exposure In this case the authors recognize many with varying degrees of influence over the health of the child independent of aluminum exposure birth year and season sex maternal age at delivery maternal place of birth maternal smoking during pregnancy parity preterm birth birthweight maternal

Confounders are conditions that are present in a population being studied that affect the outcome being studied incidence of chronic disease They also must have no effect upon the independent variable considered aluminum exposure For example a given child s aluminum exposure has no influence over maternal health maternal place of birth the child s birthweight how many pregnancies his her mother had etc yet these factors are known to contribute to the risk of developing chronic diseases These conditions can and should be adjusted for There are a number of ways to do this appropriately For example if we know how much each of these confounders contributes to chronic illness their effect can be effectively subtracted so that what is left must be the contribution of the independent variable aluminum exposure on chronic illness This is called Multivariable Regression analysis Another way to approach it would be to simply compare groups with the same proportion of confounders but differing only with respect to aluminum exposure and see if there is a difference in the incidence of chronic illness If there were a difference it would be attributed to the difference in aluminum exposure This is known as Matching The authors stated that they adjusted their models to account for the ones listed above However they also adjusted for the number of visits to a general practitioner before age 2 years This is an obvious blunder The problem here is that if a child developed a chronic disease from aluminum exposure at age 5 it is also likely that the child needed to see their pediatrician more often before the age of 2 In other words the number of doctor visits could be dependent upon aluminum exposure and should not be adjusted for In fact that is the point of the entire study to see if a connection between aluminum exposure and chronic diseases exists By choosing to adjust for this variable the researchers are acknowledging that kids who develop chronic disease by age 5 had a higher likelihood of seeking medical attention before the age of 2 But if aluminum exposure is associated with chronic disease at age 5 then it too would be associated with more doctor visits before

the peer reviewers from Annals of Internal Medicine didn t catch it The implications are disquieting Step 5 Analyze and report your findings So what did they do with their data Did they compare the health outcomes of the least vaccinated to the most vaccinated No they did not Instead they calculated hazard ratios for each of the specified outcomes per mg of aluminum exposure They did exactly the opposite of what we would have predicted they looked for differences between kids who had small differences in exposure and showed us their results of their primary analysis in a forest plot The vertical dashed line is centered on a hazard ratio of 1 i e no increased risk or benefit over a difference of 1 mg of aluminum exposure The black diamonds represent hazard ratios for each of the specified outcomes The horizontal heads and tails attached to each diamond represent the range of statistically insignificant findings In other words if the head or tail extends across the vertical line there is no statistical significance of an mg of extra aluminum exposure through vaccination for that particular chronic disease Step 6 Discussing your findings If there were a statistically significant increased risk of developing a chronic disease from a mg of aluminum the black diamond and its head and tail would appear on the right side of the vertical line As you can see none of the conditions are associated with more aluminum exposure In fact most are centered on the left side Hazard Ratio 1 of the dotted line Hence the authors conclude that aluminum exposure is not associated with any of the chronic diseases they identified However the authors neglect to mention the most glaring finding several of the outcomes have a statistically significant decrease in their hazard ratio These include asthma angioedema unspecified allergies food allergy autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and neurodevelopmental outcomes as a whole The problem here is that there is no

inflammatory conditions The authors are not proving that there is no associated increased risk of these conditions with increasing aluminum exposure they are proving that their study is confounded at some level How do they explain this startling finding They don t Worse their peer reviewers didn t demand that they do so either The reality is that there is very little evidence in published studies that showcases the absurdity of the authors results Either there is no prior evidence of an association between vaccine load and chronic diseases or evidence of an association has been filtered out of medical journals Unfortunately for those who hail these findings as definitive proof of aluminum safety there is at least one study that completely upends the Danish study Here are the results from its primary analysis The study examined 9 year olds from the Florida Medicaid system during the approximate years of the Danish study But instead of grouping all the children together and calculating differences in outcomes as a function of small increments in vaccine exposure the authors did what we would expect compare those with no exposure to those with increasing exposure as evidenced by the number of vaccination visits A single vaccination visit was associated with a 70 increase in autism spectrum disorder With more visits came a greater risk demonstrating dose dependency a hallmark of causality The control group something conspicuously absent from the Danish study comprised about 5 000 children who received no vaccinations In other words this study was tiny compared to the Danish study however the results carried a high statistical significance This means that the signal was very strong The absence of the signal in the much bigger Danish study is a testament to the impact of the authors inexcusable and nonsensical approach in their analyses The Danish study did in fact include a cohort of children with zero aluminum exposure The authors noted that Only 15 237 children 1 2

least the peer reviewers should have demanded that the authors respond to at least some of the obvious problems I identified in their discussion This study is reminiscent of another that made headlines three years ago involving the use of ivermectin in avoiding hospitalization from COVID 19 Instead of hiding the potential danger of aluminum exposure from vaccination the study was designed to hide the benefit of Ivermectin in treating COVID 19 The study examined a relatively small number of patients fewer than 2 000 in Brazil during the spring of 2021 when the pandemic response was in full gear and our authorities were stressing full vaccine compliance At the time there were already dozens of published studies demonstrating significant benefits of ivermectin treatment with regard to hospitalization especially if treated early Yet this study Effect of Early Treatment with Ivermectin among Patients with Covid 19 published in the highly regarded New England Journal of Medicine found no benefit of this extremely cheap safe and fully licensed drug Once again we have a forest plot which shows us how subgroups did if given ivermectin compared to placebo as an outpatient The black squares to the left of the vertical line mean that those subgroups had a lower chance of requiring hospitalization if treated with Ivermectin and not a placebo The stunning thing is that most subgroups did better if treated with ivermectin versus no treatment However the confidence interval extended across the point of no effect In other words the benefit", "chunk_id":

words the benefit was not statistically significant The New York Times wasted no time in reporting the failure of this treatment Why did Ivermectin fail if so many prior studies showed benefit One reason is that the study was too small to show a statistical benefit In fact the results are quite promising as most subgroups seemed to do better even with a relatively small number of people enrolled The real reason why the study failed is that the participants in the study were underdosed with Ivermectin The protocol used by the researchers was only 40 of what had previously been used to treat COVID 19 effectively It s very easy to show no effect for a therapeutic agent just administer it at a sub therapeutic dose If we lived in a world where researchers always sought meaningful results for the public they would have used a dosing regimen that was known to be effective If we lived in a world where the media appropriately critiqued controversial topics the Times would have cited opposing opinions like the one I wrote for The Defender the day this study was released If we lived in a world where our agencies of public health were doing their best for say public health they would have recognized the promising results from this small study and done the obvious conduct another study a bigger one that used an appropriate dosing regimen After all we were in a global pandemic Why would they instead deem this medicine as horse paste and spur public ridicule of anyone who suggested its potential benefit Studies appearing in respected peer reviewed journals are not what we think they are Some like this and the Danish one are sophisticated propaganda curated specifically for medical professionals who implicitly trust the editorial boards of the publications that

Target As Denmark prepares to become the first country in the world to tax farmers for greenhouse gasses emitted by their livestock critics say the real goal is to consolidate control over the food

gasses emitted by their livestock in a deal reached June 24 between the Danish government and representatives of the farming industry and unions The tax which specifically targets methane emissions by cows pigs and sheep will take effect in 2030 pending final approval by the Danish Parliament The Associated Press AP reported Beginning in 2030 farmers will be required to pay a tax of 300 kroner approximately 43 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent This will increase to 750 kroner 108 by 2035 After a 60 tax deduction the respective amounts will be 120 kroner 17 30 and 300 kroner CNN quoting Denmark s green think tank Concito reported that Danish dairy cows emit on average 5 6 tonnes 6 2 U S tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per year This would result in a tax of 672 kroner per cow 96 in 2030 and 1 680 kroner 241 in 2035 The respective emissions figure for all Danish cows is an average of 6 6 tons of CO2 equivalent annually according to the AP which reported that the Danish government aims to reduce the country s greenhouse emissions by 70 from 1990 levels by 2030 citing Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus According to CNN the proceeds from the tax will be used to support the agricultural industry s green transition in the first two years including the investment of 40 billion kroner 3 7 billion for measures including reforestation and establishing wetlands After two years the tax will be reassessed Denmark is a significant exporter of pork and dairy products CNN reported Agriculture is the country s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions The AP reported that as of June 2022 there were nearly 1 5 million cows in Denmark Tax will encourage farmers to look for solutions to reduce emissions Proponents of the tax emphasized that Denmark is the first country to enact such a policy characterizing it as a step toward greater environmental sustainability We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045 Bruus said We are investing billions in the

purpose of the tax is to get the sector to look for solutions to reduce emissions CNN reported Hasforth noted that farmers could for instance change the feed they use as part of their efforts to reduce emissions The Danish Society for Nature Conservation called the tax a historic compromise in remarks quoted by the AP The organization s president Maria Reumert Gjerding said We have succeeded in landing a compromise on a CO2 tax which lays the groundwork for a restructured food industry also on the other side of 2030 And Ben Lilliston director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy told PBS NewsHour that methane emissions are a huge problem a huge challenge He argued that while methane remains in the atmosphere for fewer years than CO2 it has about 80 times the potency If you reduce methane you can get more near term results and allow us to have a little longer of a window to reduce carbon dioxide emission Lilliston said Carbon tax on farmers a scary experiment Denmark s carbon tax was enacted despite recent farmers protests throughout Europe including large protests in Brussels the de facto capital of the European Union EU and center of EU policymaking The farmers voiced grievances over new environmental regulations and the corporate takeover of European farming In recent years EU member states such as Ireland and the Netherlands have also pursued plans to limit farming and cull livestock leading to protests in those countries New Zealand planned to enact a carbon tax set to take effect in 2025 The tax passed by the country s previous center left government was repealed last month by New Zealand s new center right governing coalition according to the AP Criticisms are now being levied against Denmark s new carbon tax with some experts arguing that it amounts to an added burden for the agricultural sector particularly small farmers CNN quoted Danish farmers association Bæredygtigt Landbrug which

off their lands Tim Hinchliffe editor of The Sociable said small farms will bear the brunt of the new tax Small farmers will be the first to go and their land will most likely be used to house a variety of so called green initiatives such as fake meat labs acres of solar panels and wind turbines as far as the eye can see new AI data centers that require tons of water energy and land and possibly even nuclear power plants to power those data centers he said Similarly Terhorst said the goal is to close down the small farmers as part of the Agenda 2030 U N SDGs or the corporate takeover

the U N talk about sustainability they don t mean self sustainability for the individual They don t want that at all They want to ensure sustainable control influence and power for themselves for decades to come Hinchliffe said adding As I see it the real goal here is to take control of prime agricultural land and to tax farmers out of existence Once the taxes get too expensive and the farmers can t keep up that s when public private entities swoop in to take control of the land If they really believed that flatulent farm animals were responsible for the weather they would just plant more trees to absorb the carbon and their imaginary crisis would be solved but they re not doing that because what they re really after are land grabs money and total control of our food systems According to Hinchliffe global organizations also aim to change human habits including meat consumption He said On a nutritional level groups like the WEF and the U N want us eating less meat and more bugs and this will only make us weaker and more docile as a species over time It also makes us all dependent on very centralized sources of protein so if there s an outbreak or a contamination citizens all over the world will suffer because there ll be no alternative The local farmers will have disappeared due to the carbon taxes and land grabs The bio meat industry was organized and financed by the investors and banks that are part of the WEF Terhorst said If we want to become sustainable we have to limit the powers of the investors and WEF and support small farmers Hinchliffe added When carbon taxes fail to quash the human spirit completely they already have plans to tax just about everything else in nature including the air we breathe the water we drink and the very soil upon which we

The Defender he drafted the bill House Bill 4499 after speaking with parents in Wyandotte a community just south of Detroit who were upset about cell antennas being installed on the community s elementary school he said Putting these towers right on schools is a horrible idea he said DeSana s bill prohibits 4G and 5G cell towers and antennas from being installed within 1 500 feet of schools The bill wouldn t cancel out contracts already signed for installing towers on school properties But if some of these agreements expired they would be subject to the law meaning they would be prohibited from putting a new tower contract in place DeSana said Reps Rachelle Smit R D43 and Joseph Fox R D101 also sponsored the bill which on May 2 2023 was referred to the Government Operations

be run by Republicans who may advance the bill to a vote on the House floor he said The bill s prohibition on placing cell towers within 1 500 feet of a school building isn t preempted by federal law meaning that state legislators can legally pass the bill according to W Scott McCollough lead litigator for Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless cases The Telecommunications Act of 1996 the federal law for siting cell towers includes zoning provisions prohibiting some state and county officials from denying wireless project land use permit applications based on health concerns or where the denial would effectively prohibit the applicant from providing service to the area But those provisions don t apply when the state or local jurisdiction is not

Up By Yaakov Ophir Ph D Two years have passed since the official end of the COVID 19 pandemic yet the topic of vaccination remains highly sensitive in both public and scientific discourse Attempts to question the legitimacy of the mass vaccination campaign or to raise concerns about potential harms are often met with a moral red line the widely repeated claim that COVID 19 vaccines have saved millions and millions of lives Remarkably this assertion was treated as established fact even during the recent U S Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing on May 21 which focused on vaccine related adverse outcomes Ranking member Richard Blumenthal opened the hearing with the following statement As we talk about the side effects of COVID vaccines I think we need to be clear about the most important fact For all Americans COVID 19 vaccines have saved millions and millions of lives There is no scientific question about that fact One study found that 3 million American deaths were averted in the United States I would like this study entered into the record This confident assertion raises a fundamental question Is there truly solid and conclusive scientific evidence to support the powerful claim that the COVID 19 mass vaccination campaign resulted in a net benefit of millions of lives saved Faced with this fundamental question our research team undertook a structured step by step evaluation of the empirical foundations of the millions saved narrative Building on our prior work we critically examined the hypothetical statistical models that produced this extraordinary figure as well as multiple randomized controlled trials and large scale observational studies that served as the empirical basis for the vaccine efficacy estimates fed into these models We have now uploaded our full length article with what we believe to be urgently important findings to a preprint server in order to allow scientists physicians and policymakers to independently evaluate the evidence Because meaningful scientific discourse requires careful scrutiny of the data we strongly urge readers not to rely solely on the current brief article but to engage directly with

not to rely solely on the current brief article but to engage directly with the full analysis presented in our preprint Our goal here is to highlight several central findings that in our view demand serious attention given their direct relevance to one of the most significant public health interventions in modern history a global government backed mass vaccination campaign that in many countries was accompanied by mandates and unprecedented restrictions on individual freedoms What follows is a concise overview of key insights from our structured analysis that in our view every health professional policymaker and citizen deserves to consider 1 The widely cited claim that millions of lives were saved by COVID 19 vaccines is based on hypothetical models that rest on a long sequence of assumptions many of which are either weak unvalidated or demonstrably false see below As a result the outputs of these models are of questionable value and cannot be taken as reliable evidence 2 A central assumption underlying these models was that COVID 19 vaccines provided strong and durable protection against infection and transmission Consider the original statement by Dr Anthony Fauci then chief medical adviser to the U S president When you get vaccinated you not only protect your own health but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community you become a dead end to the virus This assumption serving as the cornerstone of the mass vaccination campaign turned out to be false Real world data quickly revealed that vaccine efficacy against infection was fragile and short lived and efficacy against transmission was never directly studied 3 Strikingly despite the collapse of this original narrative point 2 the vaccination campaign continued under a revised justification that the vaccines provide lasting protection against severe illness and death even after their short term effect against infection diminishes It is important to recognize that this updated claim hinges on a conceptual separation between these two types of efficacy a separation that as we demonstrate repeatedly in our preprint article was never empirically validated 4 In fact available data suggest that protection against infection and protection against severe illness or death are closely linked following a similar trajectory of waning over time The difference lies primarily in timing with a natural delay between initial infection and the development of severe outcomes 5 To directly assess the validity of this supposed distinction between protection against infection and protection against severe illness we examined the conditional probability of severe illness among individuals who became infected across several key studies The results were clear the apparent protection against severe outcomes was most likely a byproduct of the short term protection against infection None of the influential studies we analyzed demonstrated independent or durable protection against severe illness or death", "chunk_id":

across several key studies The results were clear the apparent protection against severe outcomes was most likely a byproduct of the short term protection against infection None of the influential studies we analyzed demonstrated independent or durable protection against severe illness or death 6 Notably some studies stopped tracking severe outcomes precisely at the point when vaccine protection would be expected to wane paralleling the well documented decline in protection against infection and the typical delay between infection and the onset of severe illness or death mentioned above This pattern raises serious concerns about potential misrepresentation or selective reporting of research findings 7 Finally the pivotal randomized controlled trial that led to the Emergency Use Authorization of the Pfizer vaccine showed no meaningful difference between the vaccine and placebo groups in preventing 1 flu like symptoms 2 severe COVID 19 or 3 all cause mortality The only significant difference was observed in a non clinical outcome laboratory confirmed COVID 19 infection and even this result was based on data from no more than 8 24 of participants collected in a potentially biased manner as detailed in our preprint 8 Notably no COVID 19 related deaths were recorded in Pfizer s pivotal trial This absence raises serious questions about whether the legal and medical criteria for issuing an emergency use authorization were truly met 9 Even more importantly the six month follow up trial by Pfizer reported 15 deaths in the vaccine group n 21 720 compared to 14 in the placebo group n 21 728 Given the large sample size this lack of mortality benefit should have served as a critical anchor for any hypothetical model or evidence based discussion regarding the overall benefit of the vaccine These findings seriously challenge the notion that COVID 19 vaccines saved millions of lives Moreover our in depth investigation uncovered a broader range of methodological flaws that cast doubt on the overall reliability of the existing evidence base These include a follow up periods that were exceedingly short and inconsistently applied across groups b implausible efficacy signals appearing almost immediately after vaccination well before full immunization could have occurred biologically and c heavy reliance on observational data vulnerable to Healthy Vaccinee Bias differential testing rates and numerous other confounding factors Taken together these methodological and empirical concerns not only undermine the foundation of the millions

hospitalization or death and d an increasingly robust body of evidence on adverse effects were systematically sidelined Figure 1 This narrowing of focus peering through the keyhole of one transient success has allowed a fragile claim to solidify into a powerful myth reinforced by institutional authority social conformity and the systematic suppression of dissenting voices including our own experience of censorship as detailed in our preprint We therefore call on the scientific and medical communities to take a step back widen the lens and return to a foundational principle of medicine every intervention no matter how promising must undergo continuous evidence based evaluation of both its benefits and its potential harms To the best of our knowledge such a balanced and rigorous appraisal has yet to be applied to the COVID 19 vaccines Based on the evidence reviewed in our preprint we conclude that the claim that COVID 19 vaccines saved millions and millions of lives is not supported by empirical evidence While these vaccines were widely promoted as safe and effective accumulating reports of serious adverse events such as myocarditis pericarditis thrombosis and neurological symptoms have been extensively documented across pharmacovigilance systems and in multiple peer reviewed studies many co authored by the last author of the current article Notably this biologically active intervention was administered repeatedly in the form of boosters thereby compounding potential risks often in populations with near zero risk of COVID 19 related mortality such as children Taken together with the lack of demonstrable long term efficacy presented in our preprint the available evidence suggests that the risk benefit balance of the COVID 19 vaccines may in fact

pardon is an acknowledgment of guilt despite Biden s claims to the contrary investigative journalist Paul D Thacker said in this week s edition of The Defender In Depth Thacker editor of The Disinformation Chronicle and a contributor to outlets like RealClearInvestigations said Fauci didn t accept the pardon for no reason He knows that he faces legal jeopardy because there are already two referrals over to the Department of Justice to prosecute him for lying to Congress Thacker said According to Thacker Alex Azar secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS during the first Trump administration advised Fauci not to accept the pardon HHS oversees the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID which Fauci headed until late 2022 Thacker said Azar advised Fauci not to accept the pardon because it s going to set a terrible precedent and does imply guilt Thacker noted that Azar was speaking not just as the former HHS secretary but also as the former attorney general of California Congress can continue investigating Fauci The pardon retroactive to Jan 1 2014 shields Fauci from federal charges for actions performed as part of his official government duties during this period but Thacker said Fauci may still face other legal challenges including from Congress They can continue to investigate him Thacker said He can be pulled into

that people eat every day is ultraprocessed industrially manufactured products like chips or candy that are made by breaking down whole foods modifying and combining them with additives to make them more attractive in the way they look smell and taste Scientists have linked consumption of ultraprocessed foods UPFs to obesity and other health issues such as cancer and diabetes Now they are starting to discover why people eat more UPFs and gain excessive weight Filippa Juul a nutritional epidemiologist at Downstate Health Sciences University part of the State University of New York led a recent review of the evidence Juul is a leading researcher on the impacts of UPFs on cardiovascular disease and on obesity and weight gain Juul talked to U S Right to Know about her findings What is the evidence linking UPF to obesity Multiple studies have followed people over time and seen that those who eat a diet high in UPFs tend to be at higher risk of gaining weight or becoming obese There is also a landmark experimental study that tested whether eating a diet high in UPFs would lead to greater energy intake and weight gain compared to a diet based on minimally processed foods or whole foods if the two diets contained the same number of calories and macronutrients Previously people assumed that UPFs would lead to weight gain because they tend to be higher in sugar and fat and lower in fiber But in the experimental study that was published in 2019 in the journal Cell Metabolism 20 participants at a research hospital in Bethesda Maryland spent two weeks on a diet high in UPFs and then two weeks on a diet free from UPFs The food offered in both diets was matched for total calories and macronutrients and participants could eat as much or as little as they wanted The study found that people on the UPF diet unconsciously ate about 500 more calories and gained more weight These patients didn t rate the food as tasting better nor indicated they were hungrier at the start of the meal or fuller at the end of the meal The study which was led by Kevin Hall a nutrition and neuroscientist who recently retired from the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney

nutrition and neuroscientist who recently retired from the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases was replicated in a small sample by researchers in Japan The Japan study found that a diet of UPFs led to an intake of about 800 more calories per day compared to a traditional Japanese diet This is the strongest evidence we have It is quite consistent Why do UPFs make people eat more and gain weight This is still not fully understood but there are several hypotheses that are supported by the evidence One is that UPFs tend to have a higher energy density per gram they contain more calories When food contains more calories in a smaller volume we tend to eat more of it before we feel full Also UPFs tend to have a softer texture so people can eat them more quickly This means our energy intake rate is higher and the UPFs are less satiating so we tend to eat more Another reason is that UPFs can be hyperpalatable That is food that has combinations of nutrients such as fats and salt or sugar and fats or carbohydrate and salt at levels over a certain threshold For example potato chips have fat and salt but not all potato chips are hyperpalatable This doesn t necessarily mean that consumers think they taste better It means they are very rewarding and make people want them more and eat more Another potential mechanism is that nutrients in UPFs are more easily absorbed and tend to be taken up in the first part of the small intestine This leads to lower release of appetite regulating hormones that are triggered when nutrients reach a more distal part of the small intestine What else do we need to know We don t have as much experimental evidence as we would like We need more controlled feeding studies like the study by Hall and colleagues This would enable scientists to specifically look at changes in gut microbiome and biomarkers for example to tease out which factors in these foods promote weight gain and obesity One big question that scientists are asking is whether there is something inherent in the type of processing used to manufacture these foods that means people should avoid all UPFs Or are there certain things we can tweak such as eliminating certain additives to make them healthier We also need to better understand how UPFs impact individuals at critical life stages such as early infancy childhood and

problems tied to UPF UPFs dominate the food system The food industry has been key in driving its consumption The industry has promoted snacking and encouraged people to eat more by selling larger portion sizes and to eat outside of meals through marketing campaigns that make it acceptable to eat everywhere They also make sure that food is heavily marketed including to children and available everywhere Should governments impose controls on UPFs I think the evidence is strong enough to generally minimize the consumption of UPFs We should have stricter regulations on the marketing of these foods to children and youth We have very strong evidence that eating a diet based on nutritious whole foods including vegetables fruits legumes whole grains fish and nuts makes us healthier I don t think we need to reinvent the wheel by engineering UPFs with qualities that mimic whole foods But people who are in the business of selling UPFs are very interested in those kinds of solutions Some

states push digital driver s licenses obtainable through digital wallets critics warn that the digital ID document system will give the federal government access to personal data including real time remote access to people s phones You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up California recently joined a growing list of states offering digital driver s licenses through digital wallets including Apple Wallet Google Wallet and California DMV Wallet Tododisca reported The development comes amid a national push to encourage U S citizens to acquire REAL ID compliant documents by May 7 when the Transportation Security Administration TSA will begin REAL ID enforcement for domestic air travelers The REAL ID Act of 2005 established security standards for state issued ID cards in response to the 9 11 attacks and the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission In the intervening years though its implementation has been delayed most recently due to the COVID 19 pandemic Proponents of state level digital ID documents and REAL ID cite factors such as the convenience of digital documents and national security concerns that necessitate the collection of biometric data to verify people s identities In January former President Joe Biden issued an executive order offering guidance for digital ID documents But for Twila Brase co founder and president of the Citizens Council for Health Freedom REAL ID and digital ID may allow the federal government to usurp state s rights and assert unprecedented control over people s lives The real ID is meant for much more than flying Brase said It s meant for your life for all the things you might need an ID for in the future It is meant for federal control overall your identification and all your transactions According to Brase REAL ID represents a backdoor means through which the U S can implement a national ID system similar to many other countries It s the end of driver s license in this country They may look like it people may talk about them like it but it s really this new national ID card Brase said James F Holderman III director of investigative research with Stand for Health Freedom said The widespread adoption of Digital IDs and digital wallets lays the foundation of a surveillance based technocracy Such a system will almost certainly be used to destroy the last remaining vestiges of individual liberty freedom and privacy in this country Holderman said A national ID system could enable the rollout of a national vaccine passport or implementation of a national social credit scheme Brase said REAL ID gives

conformed with the REAL ID law have said essentially that they will abide with any changes Homeland Security or TSA makes in the future Brase said This could include situations like access to medical care buying a gun getting married opening a bank account whatever it might be that Homeland Security would deem necessary for national security or for whatever purpose Brase said Speaking March 6 on the One Dream Podcast Brase said REAL ID will also give the federal government unprecedented access to people s personal data Once the government gets access to your phone through your identification credential they put the REAL ID credential on your phone they have remote real time access to it then they ve got access to your phone Brase said during the podcast According to Brase REAL ID was intended to serve three purposes access to certain federal buildings access to nuclear facilities access to commercial flight and any other purposes as deemed necessary by the Secretary of Homeland Security However a 2014 U S Department of Homeland Security rule also allowed REAL ID to be used for any other purposes as deemed necessary by the Secretary of Homeland Security Brase said this rule essentially eviscerates the state s driver s license if it is fully imposed by placing driver s licenses under federal control The introduction of a national ID card albeit by backdoor means intrudes on the sovereignty of the individual and the state Brase said She argued that this would violate the Fourth Amendment of the U S Constitution protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures and the 10th Amendment limiting the powers of the federal government What this is is an unconstitutional federal takeover of identification in this country Brase said one that could lead to vaccine passports or a social credit system A U S vaccine passport there was a push to do that You can see that by digitizing it would make it so much simpler to go towards a global identification and control

card or another acceptable form of ID to board a commercial aircraft REAL ID is intended to improve the reliability and accuracy of driver licenses and identification cards while inhibiting the ability of terrorists and others to evade detection by using fraudulent identification TSA stated Several media reports have presented May 7 as a deadline for people to get a REAL ID compliant driver

compliant ID card to travel domestically However according to Brase that messaging is misleading They are not changing the REAL ID deadline but what they are doing is tacking on two years of progressive enforcement with progressive consequences Despite what the stories are saying on May 7 you will not need a REAL ID to fly There are other options In a commentary published in the Chicago Tribune earlier today Giannoulias confirmed that May 7 represents the start of a phased enforcement approach of the REAL ID Act culminating with full enforcement by May 5 2027 The TSA will continue

Especially with facial recognition being fraught with issues of discrimination Rectenwald also warned that digital ID can later be expanded to other functions Even if a digital identity system only serves as identification at first as the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice notes digital identities are prone to function creep that is they are intended to be used for multiple purposes that are unforeseen when the system is first designed he said Tim Hinchliffe editor of The Sociable cited vaccine passports as one such possibility While the federal government wasn t able to legally mandate vaccination to all U S citizens it went ahead anyway and mandated it to federal employees and the private sector followed suit The same can easily happen with digital identity Hinchliffe said The NOTUS report comes just days after revelations that the Social Security numbers and other personal information of practically all Americans stored by a private company National Public Data was breached in April 2024 Catherine Austin Fitts founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former U S assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development said Rather than apologize or take steps to make sure that our data is secure the Biden administration is proposing to create even more centrally controlled databases pushing for a digital ID Big Tech manages digital ID and is far more powerful than governments According to NOTUS 13 states have rolled out some kind of mobile driver s license program and more are working toward implementing a digital ID But federal action pushing the transition has been delayed creating a hodgepodge of state digital ID systems that are not coordinated at the federal level According to IDScan net the 13 states are Arizona California Colorado Delaware Georgia Iowa Louisiana Maryland Mississippi Missouri New York Ohio and Utah Ohio launched digital driver s licenses and state IDs earlier this month Similar programs are in progress in an additional 14 states while in two states Louisiana and Mississippi mobile ID can be used to vote At least seven countries have launched digital ID according to Identity com These include Canada Estonia Germany India Japan Singapore and Sweden The European Union EU launched its digital ID and wallet earlier this year Each of the 27 EU member states will offer at least one version of the EU Digital Identity Wallet which may include driver s licenses personal health data travel documents social security information personal SIM cards university diplomas and also may be connected to one s

schemes Big Tech manages digital ID and is far more powerful than governments Glaser said Big Tech has the patents and they dictate both the standards and implementation He added Their long game in the cybersecurity industry is to centralize data processing so that our state and local governments become dependent on the cybersecurity industry to function day to day This is called digital public infrastructure and it is no small thing because it neutralizes local power and governance For instance several states including Arizona Colorado Georgia Maryland and Ohio offer their digital ID cards

has developed Login gov as the standard credential for accessing federal websites many such sites including that of the IRS use the Virginia based start up ID me a private company Through public private partnerships digital identity can be very convenient for citizen interactions with governments and corporations but it can also be a tool for total surveillance and control Hinchliffe said He added Just like the jabs digital identity doesn t have to be forcibly mandated to make your life miserable but without it you may not be able to make financial transactions acquire a driver s license go to school or even access the internet According to NOTUS though fraud involving the lack of a uniform age and identity verification system including through state driver s licenses that are relatively easy to forge has cost the U S government billions of dollars and is a key driver of the Biden administration s draft executive order The draft order if implemented would ostensibly address a growing problem The government has lost billions of dollars in fraudulent claims to benefit programs using forged identification cards Most state driver s license systems do not connect to identity

Nilekani s Aadhar digital ID system has wreaked havoc on the lives of India s most vulnerable and stigmatized populations In the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand a wave of deaths took place in 2017 when impoverished citizens were cut off from government subsidized food rations by the Aadhaar system In several cases aging widows were denied rice for several months because the system rejected their fingerprint scans Around the same time three brothers died of starvation after they failed to properly register with Aadhaar and were subsequently denied rations for six months The same cruel fate was visited on the Kumari family which was unable to obtain an electronic Aadhaar ID lost its ration card and saw its 11 year old daughter Santoshi die of hunger Many people in Jharkhand have been victims of similar deprivation of food entitlements during the last few months reported India s Scroll The main reason is that Aadhaar based biometric authentication is now compulsory in about 80 of ration shops in the state According to Scroll a random sample of 18 villages where biometric authentication was compulsory found that a staggering 37 of cardholders were unable to buy their food rations Besides making Aadhaar the key to obtaining government services the Modi government has integrated data collected by Aadhar to establish a 360 degree database that automatically track s when a citizen moves between cities changes jobs or buys a new property according to the Huffington Post When COVID 19 first reached India in early 2020 Nilekani proposed employing Aadhar as the basis for an

avoid building digital identity systems and infrastructure in a way that further expands and entrenches the surveillance state as does the national identity system in India Renieris continued But it

Giorgio Agamben appeared before the Italian Senate s Constitutional Affairs Commission to issue a dramatic statement of opposition to the Green Pass Agamben is most famous for his concept of Homo Sacer or bare life in which an individual is stripped of rights and reduced to their biological essence in an extra legal regime justified by war or other emergencies When Italian authorities declared the first lockdown in March 2020 the philosopher applied the theory to his own country s heavy handed restrictions The defining feature of this great transformation that they are attempting to impose is that the mechanism which renders it formally possible is not a new body of laws but a state of exception in other words not an affirmation of but the suspension of constitutional guarantees the philosopher explained in the foreword to his collection of 2020 writings on COVID 19 Where Are We Now The Epidemic As Politics In his remarks before the Italian Senate Agamben pointed to a sinister agenda behind the official rationale for vaccine passports It has been said by scientists and doctors that the Green Pass has no medical significance in itself but serves to force people to get vaccinated Instead I think we must say the opposite that the vaccine is a means of forcing people to have the Green Pass That is a device that allows individuals to be monitored and tracked an unprecedented measure The philosopher concluded his address by taking aim at the supra national forces Bill Gates the World Economic Forum and Rockefeller Foundation among others determined to impose a system of digital identification and high tech social credit as much of the human population as possible I believe that in this perspective Agamben warned it is more urgent than ever for

Diquat an herbicide banned in the European Union EU but still widely used in the U S damages the intestines and may also trigger a harmful chain reaction in the rest of the body injuring the liver kidney and lungs according to a new review of more than 100 studies The herbicide has traditionally been studied for its toxic effects on the liver and kidneys However this review published in May in Frontiers in Pharmacology suggests the intestines are a key target for its harmful effects Studies show that diquat weakens the intestinal barrier kills beneficial bacteria interferes with nutrient absorption and triggers chronic inflammation among other impacts These local injuries may fuel damage in distant organs through a gut organ axis making diquat s toxicity more widespread and dangerous than previously understood the researchers say That perspective builds on increasing evidence of the gut s central role in our health and its interactions with the rest of the body Similarly toxic forever chemicals that accumulate in the environment have been shown to disrupt the intestinal barrier and affect other organs Studies show that Diquat primarily enters the body through the digestive tract leading to poisoning the researchers say The core mechanism of its toxicity involves reactive oxygen species ROS induced oxidative stress which not only directly damages the intestinal barrier function but also exacerbates inflammation and systemic toxicity by disrupting the balance of the gut microbiota and the normal production of metabolic products Diquat and paraquat Toxic chemical cousins The review coincides with mounting concerns about the long term health impacts of pesticides including glyphosate and atrazine especially in children and agricultural communities It also comes amid efforts by pesticide manufacturers to try to limit damage awards in lawsuits related to pesticide related illnesses and deaths and after years in which the pesticide industry sought to mislead the public about their products Bipyridyl herbicides like diquat and its highly toxic counterpart paraquat work by generating certain types of molecules reactive oxygen species or ROS that destroy cells Diquat remains active in the environment for up to 10 days in aquatic ecosystems and even longer in soil where it can be absorbed into soil particles and potentially enter the food chain the

Parkinson s disease and whose use is prohibited in more than 70 countries diquat is still used in the U S to control agricultural and aquatic broadleaf and grassy weeds Applied on potatoes rapeseed sugarcane and cotton among other crops it is also used to dry silage fermented green crops used for animal feed and hay for storage Registered with the U S Environmental Protection Agency as a non selective contact pesticide diquat kills all vegetation that it touches It also continues to be sold to countries like Brazil where its usage has soared since paraquat was banned in 2020 and small scale farmers are less likely to use personal protective equipment Herbicide harms start in the gut When ingested diquat directly damages the intestinal epithelial cells that line the gut Some of the ways diquat does this are by Shortening finger like projections villi and deepening small pits in the intestinal lining impairing nutrient absorption Generating ROS that damages tight junction proteins weakening the gut barrier and allowing toxins and pathogens to leak into the bloodstream Releasing massive amounts of pro inflammatory cytokines proteins that worsen inflammation Diquat disturbs the gut s microbial ecosystem reducing beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus while increasing harmful microbes the researchers say It also alters the production of key microbial metabolites depleting resources that fight disease and making it harder for the gut to repair itself Diquat s role in the gut organ axis Studies suggest that diquat s harmful impact on the intestine can extend to other organs the researchers say In particular Kidneys Diquat causes acute kidney injury by damaging cell membranes and activating inflammatory pathways which causes scarring and worsens kidney function Liver The herbicide disrupts mitochondria the cell s energy centers causing cell death and promoting liver inflammation and damage This may also trigger immune responses that damage tissues beyond the gut Lungs While less toxic than paraquat diquat generates harmful molecules that can damage respiratory tissue Other The herbicide may also interfere with autophagy a process that clears

limits according to a new bombshell study This far exceeds the maximal acceptable concentration of 10 ng nanograms per clinical dose that has been set by international regulatory authorities the authors wrote The peer reviewed study published this week in the journal Science Public Health Policy and the Law also found simian virus 40 SV40 DNA contaminants in the vaccines And the researchers

Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense CHD told The Defender that DNA contamination may contribute to the increase in autoimmune diseases among the vaccinated The immune system operates on very sensitive detections to initiate responses he said DNA suddenly deposited into your bloodstream could kickstart the interferon response Jablonowski said The interferon response when there s nothing to find but self could be the springboard for autoimmune disease The study also showed that the spike proteins produced after vaccination persist in the body for at least seven days

the study s findings and their significance The study found the presence of residual DNA in modRNA modified mRNA based Pfizer BioNTech genetic vaccines the concentration of which far exceeds the limits set by the international regulatory agencies Importantly a significant amount of this residual DNA is packaged within lipid nanoparticles Steger said According to Steger this is significant because the lipid nanoparticles can deliver the DNA throughout the human body He said The first problem is that the existing limits set by the international regulatory agencies apply to naked DNA like the residual DNA in drugs produced in genetically modified bacteria e g insulin or some antibiotics However DNA in the modRNA based genetic vaccines together with the modified mRNA is packaged within

limit value for DNA must undoubtedly be zero Another key finding according to Steger is the identification of two copies of an SV40 promoter enhancer sequence Steger said this SV40 sequence can act in human cells to encourage nuclear transport of plasmid DNA raising safety concerns of unintended genomic integration of residual DNA from the plasmid The presence of SV40 increases the risk for the plasmid DNA of being transported into the cell nucleus and probably integrated into the genome Steger said Jablonowski said SV40 penetrates the barriers of human cells transferring foreign DNA directly into the nuclei violating that which ought to remain inviolable Steger said the results also show robust spike protein production by cultured cells The produced spike proteins did not stay parked on the cell membrane at the injection site but were packaged into exosomes According to Steger This means that the produced spike protein may be exported all over the body Cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough told The Defender the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines have a dangerous mechanism of action They contain the genetic code for the potentially lethal SARS CoV 2 spike protein Once injected into the body there is no way to control their biodistribution duration or quantity of spike protein produced As a result some victims must have maldistribution over produce spike protein or have susceptibilities to its cellular and tissue damaging properties McCullough said Christof Plothe D O a member of the World Council for Health steering committee told The Defender the study showed that the presence of spike proteins lasted more than seven days contradicting earlier models that suggested the spike proteins would remain anchored at the injection site and dissipate within 48 hours Plothe said the study also demonstrated that shedding of the spike proteins is also possible The research showed that the spike proteins are not merely stuck to the cell membrane instead they are packaged into exosomes which are tiny vesicles that can be released from cells and potentially travel throughout the body This finding has major implications for the concept of shedding suggesting that if exosomes contain plasmid DNA it could be transmissible and might even have the ability to replicate posing additional risks Plothe said According to Steger these mechanisms and risks are not

represent general problems typical for this new type of modRNA genetic vaccine their production process and their mode of action This means that independent of the type of future plasmids applied in the production process modRNA genetic vaccines will act in an identical way namely they genetically transfect our body cells and convert them into production facilities for a foreign viral antigen without any control mechanisms on unwanted negative side effects Steger said this poses significant dangers for human health including risks that could be passed on to offspring This not only bears the undeniable risk of causing an autoimmune disease but with regard to the residual plasmid DNA raises the safety risk of DNA delivery to the cell nucleus and insertion into the genetic material and in a worst case scenario even to the offspring Steger said Pfizer has previously acknowledged the presence of SV40 in its COVID 19 shots but has downplayed any associated side effects Plothe said Jablonowski noted that Pfizer and BioNTech have the resources to conduct such a study but haven t This paper is within Pfizer BioNTech s capabilities Jablonowski said Yet three researchers pieced together a highly technical effort with no external funding showing that Pfizer BioNTech endangered everyone injected with their product This paper explains why we have witnessed record injuries

highly pathogenic on its own Erik Sass a research assistant for the project told The Defender This collection of research demonstrates that the SARS CoV2 spike protein can inflict harm on the human

production of the spike protein throughout the body Sass said Sass said the database contains studies published in reputable scientific journals following peer review but that many formerly respected scientific publications have deviated from the high standard of intellectual integrity that made them authoritative According to Sass the project was inspired by the publication of Toxic Shot Facing the Dangers of the COVID Vaccines in June particularly its chapter on spike proteins Sass was one of the researchers who contributed to that chapter As more and more research emerged we decided to continue adding to the collection to turn it into a standalone resource for general reference Sass said Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for CHD called the new database a great resource for both practitioners looking for treatment options as well as scientists studying the very obvious toxicity of the COVID 19 vaccine and SARS CoV 2 spike protein We need directly accessible information for what the future holds for addressing the myriad chronic illnesses caused by spike protein exposure Hooker said For Dalgleish the database constitutes overwhelming evidence that the spike protein is highly dangerous and its use must be halted immediately Studies like ours are now being published at ever shorter intervals and occasionally find their way into the mainstream media Steger said It

contamination in vaccines has been making headlines lately CHD Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski explains what it is how it happens and why it raises health concerns You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Legacy media fact checkers and regulators across the world repeatedly claim that DNA contamination in vaccines and particularly in the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines poses no risk to vaccine recipients Some have gone so far as to claim that concerns raised about this issue by countless researchers are baseless misinformation and conspiracy theory They concede that both older vaccines and the newer mRNA vaccines can contain residual DNA leftover from the manufacturing process but say that remnant DNA is expected and considered safe and that there are regulatory steps in place to make sure it occurs only in limited quantities The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA dismissed concerns published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry about HPV human papillomavirus DNA fragments found in products like Merck s Gardasil HPV vaccine The agency claims the fragments are not contaminants and not a risk or a safety factor The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration last month issued a statement saying that recent studies claiming mRNA vaccines are contaminated with excessive levels of DNA lack scientific rigor and that residual DNA has been in biotech products for a long time anyway Australian regulators emphasized that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks But some scientists including Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense who spoke with The Defender say residual DNA in vaccines should not be dismissed the danger he said stems from both known and unknown risks Jablonowski said those risks have long been present in many existing vaccines but they are even greater in the mRNA vaccines Through the lipid nanoparticles contained in the mRNA shots the DNA fragments have an open pass to every membrane in your body Why does DNA contamination happen Biology is complex Jablonowski told The Defender Nothing in it is very pure so there are contaminations in everything He said there have been problems with contaminants in vaccines since what the journal Pediatrics described as the First Modern Medical Disaster when 13 children administered a contaminated diphtheria antitoxin died Today

in those cells is typically destroyed or fragmented in the process of making the vaccine However the process might not eliminate all of it some remnant fragmented DNA can remain present The mRNA COVID 19 vaccines used a different process Rather than introducing a viral protein they introduced messenger RNA which trains cells to produce the SARS CoV 2 spike protein and the immune system recognizes that protein and produces antibodies The COVD 19 vaccines used an RNA making enzyme an RNA polymerase which uses a DNA template to synthesize the RNA in a lab process called in vitro transcription The DNA used in the process first has to be amplified Vaccine makers like Pfizer amplified the DNA for the vaccine using a plasmid Plasmids are small circular pieces of DNA that reside in bacteria and get reproduced when a bacteria reproduces For the COVID 19 vaccines they used E coli a commonly used bacteria in vaccine production for rapid amplification This DNA template comes with additional risk because the DNA of the plasmid used to create the template has to be removed from the vaccine before it can be injected into people Kevin McKernan the researcher who first identified the DNA in the COVID 19 vaccines found that the vaccine makers tried to get rid of that DNA by chewing it up with an enzyme called deoxyribonuclease or DNase which breaks down DNA However they failed to completely eliminate it Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us What are the potential dangers The potential risks of residual DNA in vaccines have been debated for decades without resolution according to the World Health Organization WHO Some researchers claim the remnant DNA is inert Others argue it is an important risk factor that may be oncogenic cancer causing or infectious The immune

residual RNA in the HPV vaccine Gardasil which he tested for fragment DNA after a 13 year old girl developed acute juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Maryanne Demasi Ph D reported In the Gardasil vaccine Lee found the HPV DNA present bound tightly to the aluminum adjuvant As a result it doesn t easily break down as it should Lee theorized that immune cells such as macrophages which are laden with aluminum adjuvant travel from the injection site through the blood to various organs According to Demasi the HPV DNA that is bound to the adjuvant can cause chronic immune inflammatory reactions that lead to autoimmune conditions in some people Jablonowski said the mRNA vaccines pose a new and more serious problem That s because before the introduction of the mRNA vaccine foreign DNA had no mechanism to get inside of a cell However the lipid nanoparticles make that possible The appropriate amount of foreign DNA inside the cell is zero Jablonowski said It can run amuck with all of the delicate biology necessary to operate a cell Foreign DNA could cause cells to become diseased it can disrupt regulation and if the DNA is present at cell division it could get inside the nucleus and create a host of problems he said Some researchers have argued there is evidence this contaminant DNA could be linked to rising cancer rates What do the regulators say In 1985 the FDA set an upper limit of 10 picograms per dose In 1987 the WHO increased its recommended limit to 100 picograms and then increased it again to 10 nanograms i e 100 times higher a limit now adopted by the FDA Demasi reported Researchers like Lee and McKernan say in the case of Gardasil this limit doesn t offer adequate protection because the HPV DNA can be hard to detect when it binds to the adjuvant Jablonowski said when this threshold was set regulators were only considering how much residual DNA might be in the bloodstream from vaccines because at that time there wasn t a mechanism for the DNA to get into the cell But with mRNA vaccines that threshold can likely pose a serious danger This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No

controversial Researchers and scientists have had concerns about DNA contaminants in vaccines for decades However last year genomics researcher McKernan reported finding that Pfizer s COVID 19 vaccine is contaminated with plasmid DNA which should not be present in an mRNA vaccine He said this raises concerns that the plasmid DNA could lead to cancers or autoimmune issues in some vaccine recipients After McKernan s lab made its findings public and other researchers confirmed them Health Canada also confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine contains this DNA McKernan also reported that Pfizer concealed this information from regulators In the manufacturing process for the drug s clinical trials Pfizer used PCR to amplify the DNA rather than the plasmid it later used for mass production So the first version of the drug granted emergency use authorization by the FDA didn t contain the DNA It was later revealed that the Moderna vaccines used the same production method so Moderna s mRNA vaccines also were contaminated with the remnant DNA The issue quickly became politicized with those claiming the vaccines are safe and effective calling the claims misinformation and a conspiracy theory dubbed plasmid gate Critics of the COVID 19 vaccines like Florida Surgeon General Joseph A Ladapo called on regulators to address the issue The FDA said in a response letter that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process FDA is confident in the quality safety and effectiveness of the COVID 19 vaccines However the agency provided none of the evidence on which it based that conclusion Dr Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia who serves on an FDA advisory committee for the COVID vaccines and who is himself a vaccine inventor and patent holder on RotaTeq the rotavirus vaccine recommended for universal use in infants by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in a YouTube video dismissed the concerns

Private Facebook Group Early in Pandemic COVID19 Physician Group an exclusive online Facebook community open only to doctors included private messages describing COVID 19 vaccine related injuries that doctors were afraid to discuss publicly for fear of professional retribution You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Facebook has recently announced that it was a mistake to allow fact checking to guide what is and isn t acceptable content on his massive social media platform There s been a bipolar response to this announcement Left leaning intellectual influencer Daniel Pinchbeck thinks this is a colossal mistake He recently posted this note on Substack I am deeply dismayed by Zuckerberg s decision to do away with fact checking and found him in his appearance on Rogan to be despicable Many people will die because of this in all likelihood On the other hand Zuckerberg s apparent backpedaling has drawn fierce criticism from strident dissenters to the pharma government complex attempt to demand compliance with COVID 19 vaccine mandates Zucky is pandering to a new administration about to take power in a few days How could someone who is smart enough to run and expand a tech platform over 20 years not see the futility and danger of censorship and de platforming from the beginning It s a disingenuous attempt to come clean The youthful billionaire is just trying to save his skin Personally I have felt the backlash of Facebook s absurd community standards over the last four years Nevertheless I still think this is a positive move Whether Zuckerberg has had an authentic reckoning or not the best thing he could possibly do would be to open up his 2 billion users to all information immediately and double down on his new opinion that censorship is a bad idea Deride him if you wish but let us support him in dropping the censorship net That would be the best apology I could hope for I think you are wrong Daniel Pinchbeck Many people died because of the fact checking that you are advocating for in all likelihood To make my case I would like to bring attention to an article I published nearly two years ago here in my

the invitation from a colleague a board certified critical care and pulmonologist who had similar concerns that I had Why was the medical community so obstinate that COVID 19 could not be treated with repurposed meds like hydroxychloroquine that had demonstrated effect against viral replication of coronaviruses Why were they so sure that a yet to be tested vaccine against an RNA virus would work Why were doctors advocating for masks of any sort to be required to leave your house whether you were symptomatic or not I asked basic questions like these of the physician group only to be ridiculed If that wasn t bad enough other doctors who shared my skepticism about how the medical community was strategizing were threatened by the group some challenging our clinical acumen and calling for the revocation of our medical licenses What happened to us This is what I witnessed in the private exchanges between doctors Initial reports from physicians on the front lines told a grim tale Most physicians in practice today have never dealt with a deadly pathogen spreading through their community unabated Most physicians have never had to deal with this level of infrastructure failure Not panicking was quickly regarded as irrational Early treatment options were inappropriately dismissed and those advocating for them were not just ignored they were vilified and threatened This led to the destruction of productive exchanges Dissenting opinions were rarely raised due to the risk of backlash including calls to revoke medical licenses The group turned into an echo chamber mRNA vaccines were accepted with nary a challenge to their purported safety or efficacy despite only a few months of data from the ongoing Phase III trials A few months into the vaccine campaign doctors

any doctor who raised concern over the shots There were likely many more witnessed injuries that went unreported even in this private forum The original article is lengthy but tells a tragic tale of how easily well intending educated people can quickly turn into a mob when dissent is squelched by baseless fact checking So to you Mr Pinchbeck who do you think pays the fact checkers to do the heavy lifting for you How certain are you that fact checking is necessary for public safety Do you think that you would have made different decisions about your health if you were aware of some of the concerns raised by doctors early on but weren t because of community standards If not would you agree that there should have been full disclosure so that people could make their own decisions about their health and the health of their children The only way to restore trust in a medical system that has failed the public is to place a well informed skeptic at the reins Robert F Kennedy Jr is

doctrine asserting the state cannot commit legal wrongdoing and therefore cannot be sued without its consent The DOD also argued that even if the state did not have sovereign immunity the complaint s allegations were not sufficient to claim the DOD engaged in willful misconduct when it made public statements about the safety and efficacy of the COVID 19 vaccine The DOD claimed the licensed and experimental vaccines were interchangeable and any statements were consistent with evaluations and recommendations made by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The plaintiff argued that sovereign immunity does not apply under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP Act in this case and that cutting off all redress even in the case of DOD s willful misconduct is unconstitutional and therefore it would lose the immunity typically offered by the PREP Act Responding to DOD s assertion that it did not engage in willful misconduct the plaintiff wrote The

Sept 17 2021 He was administered the Emergency Use Authorization EUA Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine even though the FDA had approved the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine on Aug 23 2021 because the DOD didn t make the approved vaccines available to the public According to the complaint Watts suffered medical symptoms after his first dose and more serious neurological side effects along with a sinus

may be effective According to the complaint the DOD capitalized on a quintessential bait and switch fraud using the fact that Comirnaty was FDA approved to bolster its claims that the vaccine

administration to draw up a new regulatory framework for PFAS chemicals have sparked suspicion among health advocates who fear the changes will shield public water systems from the costs of cleaning certain types of PFAS from public drinking water supplies You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Shannon Kelleher Moves by the Trump administration to draw up a new regulatory framework for types of toxic chemicals have sparked suspicion among health advocates who fear the changes will protect polluters but not public health The concerns come after U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Monday rolled out preliminary plans to tackle widespread environmental contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS chemicals used in myriad industries for decades that have been found to pose health threats The plans include elements that appear aimed at reversing or weakening policies pursued by the Biden administration including potentially shielding public water systems from the costs of cleaning certain types of PFAS from public drinking water supplies Zeldin said the agency would be advancing research and testing and taking other actions to ensure Americans have the cleanest air land and water But Betsy Southerland a former EPA senior scientist and a former director in the agency s Office of Water said the EPA announcement was nothing but a spin document that indicates there are problems ahead even though it s written as if it s just a fabulous plan for the future Their actions will absolutely ensure that for years longer people will be exposed to PFAS in their drinking water and their food without any relief from this administration she said A new roadmap PFAS are a class of thousands of human made so called forever chemicals that can linger for many years in the environment and are used in manufacturing and consumer products including non stick pans raincoats and cosmetics At least 45 of U S tap water is contaminated with PFAS according to a 2023 U S Geological Survey estimate and about 97 of Americans have the chemicals in their blood Some PFAS chemicals have been linked to health harms including certain cancers liver damage thyroid problems and reproductive issues Under the Biden administration the EPA in 2021 unveiled a PFAS Strategic Roadmap which aimed at putting in place a series of policies to safeguard public health protect the environment and hold polluters accountable To support these objectives the EPA finalized rules that established reporting requirements for companies that manufacture or import PFAS designated two of the chemicals as hazardous substances under the Superfund law and put limits on six PFAS chemicals in drinking water In one of the many

rule required public water systems to complete initial monitoring for PFAS chemicals by 2027 and to implement technologies for reducing PFAS in their water supplies by 2029 if levels exceeded certain limits The rule drew strong opposition from public drinking water utilities which would face substantial costs for implementing new technologies to mitigate PFAS and penalties for failing to do so Costs for drinking water systems across the country to meet the rule could exceed 3 8 billion per year according to an estimate on behalf of the American Water Works Association The new plan laid out by Zeldin states that the EPA will address the most significant compliance challenges related to national drinking water regulations for certain PFAS indicating to some attempting to read between the lines that Zeldin plans to set new rules on PFAS in drinking water The rule currently sets a limit of just 4 parts per trillion ppt for perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate PFOS as well as limits for four other PFAS chemicals Zeldin may opt to give water utilities more time to comply with the standards or he could change the standards so that fewer facilities need to comply Southerland said Indeed James Ferraro Jr an attorney who represents water utilities currently suing PFAS manufacturers to try to recover costs related to PFAS contamination said he thinks public water systems are cautiously applauding the announcement indicating that they believe the Trump administration is looking to shield them from the hefty costs of mitigating PFAS contamination The Trump administration had previously signaled that changes to the Biden administration s rules may be coming Earlier this year the administration asked for and received a 60 day pause on litigation filed by the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies over the Biden administration s limits on PFAS in drinking water with an additional 30 day pause granted last month In another indication that the Trump administration s EPA is charting its own roadmap on PFAS the administration appears poised to repeal the designations of PFOS and PFOA as hazardous substances under the Superfund law with the EPA stating that it is working with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework The agency earlier received a 60 day pause on litigation

the EPA plan makes no mention of Biden s draft guidelines for limits on releases by PFAS manufacturers which were withdrawn shortly after President Donald Trump s inauguration accompanying an executive order that froze new federal regulations A lack of clarity In another area of concern the new EPA plan fails to mention limits for landfills which were originally expected to be proposed later this year As well the EPA s new proposed plan cites smartly collecting necessary information from companies for the Toxic Substances Control Act without overburdening small business and article importers in language that suggests Zeldin may act to redo the PFAS reporting requirement rule The compliance period for the rule finalized under the Biden administration was set to begin this July Some of the initiatives announced by the EPA could support efforts to reduce widespread PFAS contamination including restricting their use and setting limits on PFAS releases into waterways said John Rumpler clean water director and senior attorney for the Environment America Research Policy Center But other aspects of the EPA plan including unspecified adjustments to liability and national drinking water limits bear careful attention as they are developed said Rumpler Calling for strengthening the science around PFAS the EPA announcement implies further work by the EPA s Office of Research and Development potentially suggesting that the agency s research arm may not be eliminated as feared said Rainer Lohmann a professor at the University of Rhode Island who directs a PFAS research program However it is also possible that the call for more science could simply be a strategy to delay action on PFAS he said For public water utilities Zeldin s announcement came as a welcome relief Along with fears about the cost of implementing the Biden administration s EPA PFAS drinking water rule water utilities also fear being caught in the crossfire of legal battles over

struck down the Biden administration s mask mandate for public transit The news followed a statement from the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC issued at the DOJ s request recommending the continued use of masks on planes trains and other public transportation The CDC said It is CDC s continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary CDC believes this is a lawful

appeal the April 18 decision of U S District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa Politico reported In her ruling Judge Mizelle stated the CDC failed to justify its decision to impose the mandate and failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures for implementing it The nonprofit Health Freedom Defense Fund filed the lawsuit that prompted Monday s ruling against the mandate The DOJ on Tuesday announced it would appeal the Florida ruling only if the CDC deemed the mandate necessary for safeguarding public health The Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC disagree with the district court s decision and will appeal subject to CDC s conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health The Department continues to believe that the order

work to preserve If CDC concludes that a mandatory order remains necessary for the public s health after that assessment the Department of Justice will appeal the district court s decision The DOJ

broader Covid response Detractors also expressed concerns about the fallout if the government were to lose an appeal Politico characterized the DOJ statement as suggesting the agency was divided about whether to continue the mask mandate stating the DOJ announcement ultimately leaves next steps in the hands of the CDC where there have been divides over how to proceed on a mandate that was already set to expire in early May There is growing consensus among White House and public health officials that an appeal would be impractical two people with knowledge of the deliberations told Politico President Biden after the Florida ruling said it s up to them meaning individuals whether to wear masks when traveling White House spokesperson Jen Psaki later clarified Biden s remark stating The president was answering the question quite literally which means we are not implementing the mask mandate because of the court order Psaki added We want to preserve that authority for the CDC to have in the future Our focus here was seeing what power we had to preserve The growing consensus within the White House and federal government may also be indicative of a growing push encouraged by polling firms and advisers close to the Biden administration to declare a political victory over the virus by lifting highly restrictive COVID related measures and mandates Health Freedom Defense Fund responding to the DOJ s statement that it would appeal the decision if directed to do so by the CDC said DOJ s statement is perplexing to say the least and sounds like it comes from health policy

further indication of the move away from mask mandates by state and local governments several public transportation systems in major U S cities including Chicago and Washington D C immediately lifted their mask requirements for passengers following the Florida ruling Conversely New York City s Metropolitan Transit Authority has opted to maintain the mask requirement for now The lifting of the

would not enforce a mask mandate in facilities under its purview such as airports Most major U S airlines including American Airlines Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines Frontier Airlines Jetblue Southwest Airlines Spirit Airlines and United Airlines also removed mask requirements for their passengers following the court ruling in Florida A group of 10 commercial air pilots from several of the aforementioned carriers filed a lawsuit in March against the CDC over the transportation mask mandate Their lawsuit claims that the policy was adopted despite countless scientific and medical studies and articles showing that face masks are totally ineffective Since March several U K air carriers including British Airways Jet2 and TUI have made face masks optional on their flights after the UK government lifted its remaining COVID related restrictions No adverse public health effects appear to have followed the elimination of the mask mandate for air travel Also of note Sweden which never

Reuters The Washington Post The Associated Press BBC and others engaged in anticompetitive practices when its members colluded with tech platforms to censor alternative viewpoints According to the DOJ statement News consumers desire and demand diverse perspectives Americans therefore vitally depend on viewpoint competition in the marketplace of ideas to limit the abuse of market power and ensure the free flow of information in our democracy The United States therefore files this statement to urge the Court to reject Defendants suggestion that the antitrust laws play no part in protecting viewpoint competition in news markets Instead controlling precedent shows that the Sherman Act protects all forms of competition including competition in information quality In a press release Abigail Slater assistant attorney general with the DOJ s Antitrust Division said When companies abuse their market power to block out and deplatform independent voices and protect legacy media they harm competition and threaten the free flow of information on which consumers depend This Antitrust Division will always defend the principle that the antitrust laws protect free markets including the marketplace of ideas Jed Rubenfeld an attorney for CHD said the DOJ s statement confirms the importance of this case and the gravity of the TNI s concerted attack on dissenting online news publishers

Hazlehurst who brought the case in the Vaccine Court said the court didn t address much of the evidence of fraud he presented but instead relied almost solely on the DOJ s argument Evidence presented in the vaccine court remains concealed from the public You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A federal judge has ruled against the father of an autistic son who alleged that lawyers representing the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS misrepresented and concealed evidence showing that vaccines can cause autism which resulted in his son being denied compensation for his injury Rolf Hazlehurst who filed a motion in April 2024 in the U S Court of Federal Claims alleged that U S Department of Justice DOJ lawyers representing HHS repeatedly defrauded the judicial system But in a ruling filed last month and released to the public on Thursday Judge Edward H Meyers concluded that Hazlehurst didn t meet the high bar of evidence to prove fraud on the court However Meyers did make it clear in his decision that the question before the Court of Federal Claims was not whether vaccines cause autism but only whether the DOJ committed a fraud on the court by concealing the evidence The ruling dealt a blow to the thousands of families who filed petitions with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP alleging vaccines caused their children to develop autism In 2002 the VICP consolidated 5 000 plus claims into the Omnibus Autism Proceeding OAP It later selected six test cases including that of Hazlehurst s son Yates as the basis for determining the outcome of all of the remaining claims Hazlehurst alleges that the OAP declined his petition for compensation because the DOJ concealed evidence a fact that didn t come to light until 2018 Hazlehurst said he plans to appeal the most recent Federal Claims decision Winning an appeal is difficult he said because you have to show the court s ruling was arbitrary and capricious an abuse of discretion or not in accordance with the law But that is basically what happened here Judge missed many critical facts Hazlehurst told The Defender that rather than considering all the arguments and evidence he presented during the proceedings Meyers only narrowly addressed his claims The Court of Federal Claims decision is not an accurate reflection of the arguments and evidence I presented

with a Special Master Hazlehurst said Almost all documents evidence and legal proceedings under the Vaccine Act are off limits to the public and the media The only window into what occurs in the VICP is the special masters and the Court of Federal Claims decisions He expressed frustration that the proceedings are kept secret The public can never access the complaint the response or the exhibits or other evidence presented The only public documents associated with the proceedings are the decisions issued by the judge And even that is confusing if one can t access the exhibits Hazlehurst said The American people should be allowed to see the motion and evidence I filed Hazlehurst said Much of the evidence has never been seen by the public I m certain the DOJ will fight tooth and nail to prevent the people from ever seeing the documents that prove the government conceded vaccine injury causes autism and perpetrated fraud upon the courts and the American people Mary Holland CEO of Children s Health Defense which sponsored Hazlehurst v HHS said Judge Meyer s decision in this case is disappointing but not unexpected He essentially repeated the holdings from the Omnibus Autism Proceeding and dismissed the idea that the DOJ perpetrated fraud on the courts Yet he missed many critical facts and failed to look beyond the program s past decisions When the reckoning on autism comes and it will

Dallas and Tyson fraternal 18 month old twins were found dead by their mother after receiving the Hepatitis A flu and DTaP vaccines on April 23 Police are investigating the parents but Dr Pierre Kory

absolutely absurd that the parents of twin babies who died a week after receiving three vaccines are still under suspicion for killing their children according to Dr Pierre Kory who reviewed the twins medical records Vaccine related sudden infant deaths SIDs are tragic and unfortunately as common as the day is long Kory said in an interview Wednesday with Children s Health Defense s CHD Polly Tommey Kory spoke with Tommey CHD TV program director about the deaths of 18 month old Dallas and her twin brother Tyson Such a double tragedy The babies died about seven days after receiving the flu shot the Hepatitis A vaccine and the DTaP diphtheria tetanus pertussis vaccine at their 18 month wellness visit When the mother brought the twins in for their wellness visit on April 23 she and her mother in law told the pediatrician they had concerns about the twins receiving the flu shot because the father s family had a history of adverse reactions to the vaccine The pediatrician told them the babies would be OK and had nurses give the twins the shots The next morning the babies lips were blue and they were lethargic according to Angela Wulbrecht a registered nurse with the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation who has assisted the parents in filing a report with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS Wulbrecht who also spoke with Tommey said the babies continued to be very sick for the rest of that week The morning of May 1 the mother found the babies dead in their bed after apparently passing away in their sleep The mother called 911 hoping the paramedics would be able to do something to help the twins She didn t know that her babies had passed until she was in the sheriff s department where they were accusing her of murder and asking her what she did to these babies Wulbrecht told Tommey The police informed the babies father who had been trying to call his wife from work after hearing that their home was surrounded by police tape that his children had died

tragic and traumatizing to those parents beyond belief he added There s immense data suggesting the deaths were vaccine related experts say Kory walked viewers through what he learned by reviewing the twins medical records Dallas and Tyson were born at about 29 weeks and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit NICU which is pretty typical for babies born that preterm Kory said After spending about a month in the NICU they spent roughly another six weeks in a neonatology service While there they had a number of typical complications of a premature baby that were well managed Kory said All of those issues had been resolved by the time the babies were discharged These children died at almost 19 months old right after their 18 month wellness visit with the vaccines Kory said And at that time they were really normal kids very healthy no major issues According to Kory there s immense data to support the theory that the twins deaths were vaccine related SIDs cases Dallas and Tyson s deaths are absolutely typical of cases of death related to a vaccine he said Kory cited a 2021 peer reviewed paper published in Toxicology Reports that reviewed medical studies and VAERS data on SIDS and unexplained infant deaths sometimes called crib deaths Kory said Unexplained deaths or crib deaths were almost unheard of before the 1960s when immunization programs started to roll out By the 70s there was an epidemic of SIDS And that was being documented Finally in 1992 there was such an outcry because parents started to be concerned and were developing the feared vaccine hesitancy That s when the American Academy of Pediatrics came up with a reason for these sudden unexplained deaths and launched the Back to Sleep campaign Kory said The idea behind the campaign was that babies who slept on their backs or sides were less likely to die in their sleep It was an absurd notion Kory said Humans have been populating this earth for millennia and we ve never recognized that children who sleep on their front have high risk of death After the campaign the number of SIDS deaths reportedly declined However Kory said it s very apparent two other things happened around that time First

death so you can no longer actually code a certificate as being related to a vaccine Second researchers noticed that other kinds of unexplained infant deaths such as suffocation in bed and other proxies for SIDS were exploding while the reported number of SIDS deaths went down In other words there was no documented decrease in neonatal mortality Additionally study after study showed a temporal link between vaccinations and infant deaths Kory said About 75 of unexplained infant deaths occur within seven days of vaccination with roughly 25 occurring on day one and another 25 occurring on day two According to Kory Some studies have found 90 of all deaths occur within seven days of vaccines Kory also cited a 1989 study in which the author analyzed 13 pairs of healthy twins who died together at the same time The author concluded that the likelihood of twin infants dying suddenly and simultaneously of SIDS a natural disorder defies credibility Instead the author said environmental hazards such as vaccines likely contributed to the deaths Kory said Some of the ingredients in the vaccines given to Tyson and Dallas are known neurotoxins Brian Hooker Ph D CHD chief scientific officer told Tommey Hooker said They got the DTaP which contains at least 300 micrograms of aluminum and Polysorbate 80 Then the Hepatitis A has more aluminum about 600 micrograms of aluminum and again Polysorbate 80 So this is almost like a delivery system to get the aluminum neurotoxin directly into the brain because Polysorbate 80 is a detergent It eclipses the blood brain barrier The flu shot given to the twins may have contained traces of up to three micrograms of mercury Aluminum and mercury are synergistically toxic Hooker said They create a reaction that is about 100 times worse than the exposure of either one of them alone Hooker and Kory agreed it was very plausible that these neurotoxins impeded the functioning of the babies neurons in the brain stem that regulate breathing So far autopsies of Dallas and Tyson have not been able to find anything Wulbrecht said noting that she has also asked Dr Ryan Cole to perform an independent autopsy Kory said it s

months at local pharmacies when TLK Dairy Farms hosted an on site vaccination clinic to encourage vaccination They were seeing that a lot of people weren t getting the shot and they decided to bring the shot to the farm Cameron told The Defender His company s leadership team didn t mandate that he get the shot They just strongly implied that they expected it he said Cameron said the intimidation to get a COVID 19 shot was extremely strong all the way around for him and his co workers People can deny it all they want he said but the fact of the matter is that if they had never brought it and

least a dozen U S states from traditionally conservative Oklahoma to liberal leaning New York are rushing to pass laws outlawing commonly used dyes and other chemical additives in foods citing a need to protect public health In one of the most far reaching efforts West Virginia on March 5 advanced a sweeping ban on a range of common food dyes that have been linked to health problems particularly for children with overwhelming support from both Republicans and Democrats The new law prohibits the sale of any food product containing certain yellow blue green and red dyes often found in candies snacks and other foods and drinks and goes much further than any other state in moving to eliminate the chemicals from store shelves The West Virginia measure has passed both legislative chambers and is expected to receive final clearance within the next week to move to the governor s desk for signing Public health advocates have been lobbying for state and federal action for years pointing to research that links food dyes and other chemical additives to a range of health risks including neurobehavioral problems and cancers Food industry advocates have protested efforts to ban the additives citing what they say is a lack of proof that the chemicals are harmful to people and arguing such laws will make food more expensive But supporters of the measures say the MAHA movement associated with newly appointed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is giving fresh momentum to the efforts Kennedy has long warned about chemical additives in food and vowed in his confirmation hearing before Congress to scrutinize the chemical additives in our food supply There is a lot of support for these measures now for a few reasons The most obvious one is the MAHA movement said Laura Wakim Chapman chair of the West Virginia Senate Health and Human Resources Committee Viral videos and social media content is informing the public about the dangers of unnecessary

agency acted only after advocates petitioned for the ban citing industry studies that linked red dye No 3 to cancer in rodents more than 30 years ago I think many see FDA s belated ban on Red 3 as further evidence that FDA is not very effective at safeguarding the food supply said Lisa Lefferts an environmental health consultant who served on a 2011 FDA advisory board Republicans are taking a more active role in this issue than ever before In Virginia lawmakers recently passed a bill that bans seven food dyes from public schools With strong bipartisan support the law now awaits the governor s signature Consumers are demanding better food choices and questioning why other countries restrict harmful dyes while America continues to allow them said Hillary Pugh Kent a Republican in the Virginia legislature who led the bill s passage And Oklahoma on March 3 advanced its own similar measure which would ban 21 synthetic dyes and other additives from food distributed in the state The proposed law would give manufacturers until January 2027 to reformulate their products but would immediately require them to display a warning label if their products contain any of the 21 additives New York lawmakers similarly have launched an effort to force food companies to eliminate synthetic dyes and chemical additives from their products The proposed law there would ban seven food dyes from food sold or served in public schools and would ban statewide sales of foods with red dye No 3 and two other food additives The law would also require food companies to disclose secret food ingredients to the public that have been allowed into the marketplace under a federal standard known as generally recognized as safe or GRAS The New York law takes specific aim at the FDA and

proponent Dr Paul Offit warned that Americans should be scared after CDC vaccine expert Dr Fiona Havers resigned citing concerns about the future of vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F

Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ACIP on June 9 due to their pervasive entanglement with the industry they are supposed to be regulating Predictably industry spokespersons posing as legitimate scientists like Dr Paul Offit stirred up anger and dismay at this move writing a series of posts on his substack newsletter ironically named Beyond the Noise In his latest article This CDC Resignation Should Scare You Offit praises the efforts of CDC epidemiologist Dr Fiona Havers for her 13 years of service to public health who recently quit her post because she explains I no longer have confidence that these data will be objectively evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence based vaccine policy decisions Offit agrees linking her last presentation to the ACIP in April of this year which he believes is proof of her allegation Writes Offit She found that at least 7 000 children were hospitalized with Covid About 20 percent of those hospitalized were admitted to the intensive care unit half were previously healthy virtually none had been vaccinated and 152 had died most less than 4 years of age The conclusion was clear all children in the United States whether they were previously healthy or not should receive the primary series of Covid vaccines For these reasons the CDC recommended the Covid vaccine for all children Based on this data Offit Havers and the American Academy of Pediatrics agree that withdrawing COVID 19 vaccinations for healthy children and pregnant mothers would be disastrous But was the conclusion clear I read through the 29 slides of Havers presentation and came to a much different conclusion Let s do what Havers wants the CDC to do and objectively evaluate these data with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence based vaccine policy decisions First the presentation has glaring omissions of crucial metrics For example in Offit s summary he states that of the 7 000

it mean if fewer than 5 of the hospitalizations occurred in the vaccinated Nothing Unless you know the vaccination rate of all children in these age groups you cannot determine if the vaccination is doing any good Why would the CDC epidemiologist charged with informing ACIP members leave this out Did she expect that the advisory panel wouldn t ask about it She probably did and she was probably right That is what is scary It s the blind leading the blind CDC data for the 2024 2025 season shows that 13 of kids under 17 are up to date with their COVID 19 vaccination The CDC doesn t break down vaccine uptake in each specific age group Why Too bad there wasn t a veteran analyst working for them to give us this crucial number Let us assume that the 13 vaccination rate applies to every age category under 17 and that 5 of hospitalized children were vaccinated Roughly speaking and ignoring confounders unvaccinated and vaccinated children are not equally prone to hospitalization prior to getting vaccinated how can we determine the utility of being up to date on COVID 19 vaccines with regard to avoiding hospitalization First we would need to determine the risk of hospitalization if vaccinated compared to being unvaccinated Then we would need to know how many kids need to be vaccinated to prevent a single hospitalization Then we would need to determine the risk of vaccination borne by this number of kids More crucial pieces of information are required which are suspiciously absent from Havers presentation Havers does give us a place to start slide 6 Let s take one of those

000 0 000385 We can similarly calculate the rate of hospitalization in unvaccinated children because we know that the other children 87 000 per 100 000 are unvaccinated and they account for the other 95 hospitalizations So the rate of hospitalization among the unvaccinated is 95 in 87 000 95 87 000 0 001092 Now we can calculate the number of hospitalizations prevented by vaccinating 100 000

Doctor what are the chances that this new COVID 19 vaccine will prevent my kiddo from being hospitalized with COVID 19 The pediatrician will answer confidently It s about 1 in fourteen hundred This is of course a purely hypothetical exchange where the parent asks an appropriate question and the pediatrician is honest and properly informed So does this mean the shots ought to be recommended The only way to answer that question is to know something about the risk of these injections How can the pediatrician or any of the ACIP members be certain that exposing 1 414 children to an mRNA shot won t result in one or more adverse events that could be even more serious than a hospitalization from COVID 19 ACIP advisors are making recommendations for millions of kids Shouldn t this be an important

for new treatments Reuters reported According to Endpoint News Prasad is likely to be more conservative in his approach to CBER than Marks given his focus on overall survival in cancer trials and calls for tightening standards for accelerated approvals Marks forced to resign from CBER in March criticized HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr in his resignation letter It has become clear that truth

sent out an action alert encouraging people to get behind a federal executive order to support religious exemption rights Both state and federal actions are important when it comes to religious exemptions according to CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg We have to look at as many options as possible to preserve religious freedom Mack Rosenberg told Michael Kane in today s episode of Good Morning CHD TV No one s suggesting stomping on state public health laws Mack Rosenberg said This is about using federal law to protect religious freedom Mack Rosenberg told The Defender What is being proposed here is the use of federal discretionary spending to protect religious freedom not trying to create federal public health law or rewrite state laws If the order were to be adopted states would make decisions about whether they wanted to receive discretionary federal dollars where those dollars are tied to protecting the right to free exercise of religion Executive order wouldn t threaten states religious exemptions Kane founder of Teachers for Choice interviewed Mack Rosenberg and attorney Sujata Gibson to clarify what the June 4 letter led by Guiding the Impact proposed after the letter triggered confusion and concerns According to Kane the groups and individuals who signed onto Guiding the Impact s June 4 letter only signed onto the letter not a particular draft for an executive order Gibson who signed Guiding the Impact s June 4 letter told The Defender The document that I signed and 40 other groups signed was a letter asking the President to consider an

their June 14th letter that an executive order could result in a U S Supreme Court case that would likely affirm the precedent setting ruling in Jacobson v Massachusetts Such an event could further restrict religious exemptions to vaccination they wrote However Gibson told Kane that it wouldn t be possible She said any Supreme Court case related to the executive order which currently exists only in draft form and has yet to be issued would deal exclusively with constitutional issues of how federal funds are allocated not whether religious exemptions should be allowed The proposed executive order would withhold federal funds from schools that deny religious exemptions to vaccination requirements Such funds have to be spent in very specific ways Gibson explained Any potential Supreme Court case would rule on whether funds were allocated wrongfully Gibson also said it would be a misunderstanding to presume that the proposed executive order would put states religious exemptions at risk because of a federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 RFRA According to Gibson RFRA forces the federal government to offer religious protection She told The Defender RFRA is a one way valve so to speak It is consistent with RFRA to condition funding on providing religious protection But it is not something that can go the other way If a different administration were to try to condition federal funding on removing religious protection it would be a clear violation of RFRA Watch Mack Rosenberg Gibson and Kane s discussion of federal action religious exemption here

investigation which is illegal according to the ABIM s process Dr Peter McCullough also faced similar difficulties with the ABIM over his positions on COVID 19 vaccines and treatments According to MedPageToday ABIM revoked his certifications in 2022 although as of today ABIM lists him as certified McCullough told The Defender The ABIM is violating principles of equal protection due process

information A hearing followed in May According to the FLCCC Alliance s press release Kory and Marik tirelessly defended their positions However despite presenting over 170 references in a detailed 60

systemic corruption is forcing family farms off their land and concentrating control of the food supply You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The Farm Credit System FCS created nearly a century ago to save the family farm now primarily serves corporate agriculture interests even forcing small farmers off their land Attorney Dustin Kittle a former cattle and poultry farmer turned agricultural law specialist sounded the alarm on a recent RFK Jr Podcast episode describing systemic corruption within FCS and the U S Department of Agriculture USDA Kittle told Robert F Kennedy Jr Children s Health Defense chairman on leave about a web of alleged misconduct conflicts of interest and policy shifts that he claimed are decimating America s family farms while enriching corporate agricultural giants and foreign investors Kittle s crusade against these practices stems from personal experience Raised on a farm in Geraldine Alabama he later found himself embroiled in a legal battle with the very system designed to protect farmers like himself The Farm Credit Administration FCA a federal agency charged with overseeing the FCS took 657 days to investigate his case After nearly two years it concluded that while federal laws had been violated it could offer no remedy as he was no longer a borrower in the system Kittle s firm represents about 200 farmers facing similar challenges Those farmers even though they can speak to me as their lawyer are scared to death he told Kennedy Big Ag getting billion dollar loans FCS was established in 1933 during the Great Depression to support America s farmers but it has strayed far from its original mission according to Kittle Kittle alleged that FCS made a complete shift around 2009 changing its mission from saving family farms to saving the agriculture industry as a whole The FCS began prioritizing large corporations over small farmers doling out loans to JBS Foods and Tyson he pointed out We are not talking about 100 000 lines of credit We are talking about billion dollar loans to those companies Kittle contended that these policy changes also opened the door to foreign interests I wouldn t have even thought that U S Farm Credit a government sponsored enterprise could do business dealings and loans with foreign interests he said noting that this practice began in 1997 when they adjusted some

how the system now serves corporate agricultural interests Kittle said The practice involves declaring loans in distress even when farmers are current on their payments The result is often devastating for small farmers who suddenly find themselves facing foreclosure and legal battles against some of the biggest law firms in the nation which they re ill equipped to fight You might have a default provision in your mortgage that says If someone whose name is on that deed passes away we can default on them Kittle explained illustrating the often arbitrary nature of these declarations It was part of a manipulated plan to put pressure on the farmers to take that land Kittle told Kennedy Kennedy agreed that forcing farmers to hire lawyers is essentially stealing family farms from the farmer using our federal dollars Kittle said his loan was placed in distress in retaliation for representing a group of farmer borrowers Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Zero oversight all the way to the top Kittle s allegations extend beyond individual cases to what he described as systemic failures in oversight There is zero oversight all the way to the top of FCS He pointed to structural issues within the FCA where only one member serves on the board instead of the legally required three Kittle sued President Joe Biden the FCA and others over this lapse He also criticized the political maneuvering that he believes contributes to this lack of oversight citing an instance involving a nominee for the FCA board who was blocked from confirmation for two years Kittle pointed to conflict of interest issues He alleged that Dallas Tonsager who served as undersecretary at the USDA and as chairman of FCA had business ties to Redfield Energy a company involved in carbon capture technology for ethanol plants This resistance to outside oversight Kittle argued is symptomatic of a larger problem We have an entity that was set up for the farmers but we have created

risk of developing conditions such as heart disease stroke Type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life even in small doses a recent study has found BPA is a type of chemical widely found in consumer and industrial products especially in processed food and food packaging An endocrine disruptor it is known to cause hormonal problems that contribute to chronic disease as you age The study published in September in the Journal of Hazardous Materials is the first of its kind to assess the relationship between BPA exposure and cardiometabolic health outcomes from childhood to adolescence using a large variety of health markers Cardiometabolic health refers to the overall health of your heart and blood vessels and your body s ability to process nutrients regulate blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight Our results point to the need to reduce exposure to BPA in the early stages of life say the researchers led by Sofia Almeida Costa at the Institute of Public Health at the University of Porto in Portugal To gauge its effects on the body from dietary sources over time Costa and her colleagues followed 3 138 children and adolescents ages 4 to 13 from a prospective Portuguese birth cohort Bisphenol A exposure most common through diet plastics Food and beverages are considered the most significant source of human exposure to BPA Ultra processed foods for instance heavily rely on plastics for production and packaging and chemicals can migrate into food from food processing equipment and packaging among other ways In Portugal 57 of the food items consumed by the population in 2015 2016 were reported with associated packaging materials including 69 plastic materials and 3 metal After accounting for factors such as diet and energy intake the researchers found higher BPA exposure was linked to certain health risk factors including Higher blood insulin levels and insulin resistance which means the body can t use the hormone insulin properly to regular blood sugar glucose levels Higher body mass index BMI which uses height and weight to classify weight as healthy or unhealthy Increased fat mass an increased amount of body fat relative to total body weight

relevant variables including total energy intake which is usually not considered researchers say Participants provided detailed information about each food and beverage consumed including their place and time food preparation method brand quantity consumed and packaging materials only for a 13 year follow up The availability of 24 hour urine samples and the highly sensitive method used to determine BPA concentrations at relatively low levels also allowed for a more precise estimate of the total daily exposure they say BPA leaves the body quickly and levels can vary throughout the day Urgent call to reduce BPA daily exposure Increased public awareness and regulation changes have reduced BPA usage in some countries but BPA substitutes BPS BPF are less studied and may have harmful health impacts The main focus of BPA regulations in the U S is food contact applications especially those designed for children Ways to avoid chemical exposures include eating homemade food when possible avoiding plastic food packaging and not using canned food and beverages The latest study has several limitations such as the better health characteristics of the eligible participants the researchers say Adolescents at the 13 year follow up may have underreported food packaging materials and types of food industry packaging material also may have changed between 2005 and 2020 when the study was conducted Lastly the single effect of BPA on multiple health outcomes may be too reductionist since consumers are exposed to a large variety of food matrix nutrients food contaminants and environmental endocrine disruptors the researchers say Still they caution that the need to globally reduce BPA daily exposure remains urgent Adverse health effects are expected when exposure

Electromagnetic Sensitivity The Washington Post reported on dozens of electrosensitive people who moved to a remote West Virginia town with no cell service rather than endure heart arrhythmia headaches eye problems burning skin brain fog fatigue and other symptoms caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The Washington Post last week reported on dozens of electrosensitive people who moved to a remote West Virginia town with no cell service drawing mainstream media attention to how wireless radiation can cause some people to experience life altering health symptoms Electrosensitivity sometimes referred to as electromagnetic sensitivity EMS electromagnetic hypersensitivity or microwave syndrome is a federally recognized condition in which people experience adverse health effects due to electromagnetic field EMF exposure The Post interviewed residents of Green Bank West Virginia some of whom said EMF exposure previously had caused them to experience heart arrhythmia headaches eye problems burning skin brain fog memory issues fatigue and or other symptoms So they moved to Green Bank an EMF free town situated in a roughly 13 000 square mile area spanning Virginia and West Virginia The Federal Communications Commission FCC in 1958 created the protected area dubbed the National Radio Quiet Zone because the area is home to the Green Bank Telescope The telescope considered the most accurate versatile large dish radio telescope in the world is powerful enough to pick up the super faint clouds of hydrogen that hang out between the stars and galaxies Because cell tower or Wi Fi signals would drown out the subtle signals picked up by the telescope the FCC protected the area from radiofrequency RF radiation EMF interference Towns like Green Bank aren t the only remote places where people with electrosensitivity are moving a woman with electrosensitivity who asked to remain anonymous told The Defender She and others with electrosensitivity moved to Snowflake Arizona where 20 or 40 acre plots are relatively affordable and large enough to be far from any neighbor s Wi Fi signal or city cell tower Making the move was completely devasting the woman said None of us wanted to leave our jobs families churches synagogues but we had to She is far from alone in her experience

according to Physicians for Safe Technology In the 1970s and even earlier the U S military published reports on how military personnel especially radar workers experienced negative health effects from exposure to wireless radiation Current estimates vary on how many people are electrosensitive A 2020 peer reviewed study reported a high prevalence of perceived EMF sensitivity in the general population reaching 1 6 in Finland and 2 7 in Sweden 3 5 in Austria 4 6 in Taiwan 5 in Switzerland and 10 3 in Germany A 2019 analysis of U K data concluded that 5 30 of the general population had mild electrosensitivity Those numbers are high enough to warrant calling electrosensitivity a humanitarian crisis that requires an urgent response according to the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields ICBE EMF The ICBE EMF is a consortium of scientists doctors and related professionals who study RF EMF and make recommendations for RF EMF exposure guidelines based on the best peer reviewed scientific research publications In a July statement on the electrosensitivity crisis ICBE EMF emphasized the symptoms can vary from person to person but typically affect multiple body systems such as cardiovascular and neurological in a way that limits the person s ability to live a normal life ICBE EMF said The unmitigated neglected widespread disruption of lives is inhumane and deeply troubling It isn t fair that members of society with electrosensitivity are forced to leave their homes to take refuge in remote rural places W Scott

discrimination For instance the Reply Comments of Advocates for the EMS Disabled submitted in June 2022 summarized more than 330 comments calling for acceptance and inclusion of people for whom EMS is a disability The comments also said The FCC should always prioritize fiber internet and rely on wireless only when wiring is technically or economically infeasible or the main purpose is mobility If the FCC is sincere about achieving diversity equity and inclusion it must recognize the specific and profoundly deleterious effects of wireless radiation on the EMS disabled and take measures within its regulatory remit to address and solve this growing plight Fariha Husain manager of CHD s EMR Wireless program told The Defender that CHD continues to create action alerts and educational flyers

week presenting competing visions for the future at this year s World Government Summit WGS Convened from Feb 13 15 in Dubai under the slogan Shaping Future Governments the WGS brought together prominent figures in politics business and global governance in a format akin to that of the recent WEF annual meeting The WGS bills itself as a global knowledge exchange platform dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide Participants comprised over 300 speakers and 10 000 attendees including 250 government ministers and representatives from 80 international regional and governmental organizations including the U N WEF World Health Organization WHO World Bank and International Monetary Fund Musk Schwab and other leaders debated conflicting hopes and concerns for the future The WGS itself also predicted what the world will look like by 2071 released as part of the WGS Government in 2071 initiative These projections foresee a dystopian future of catastrophic climate change mass migration mass layoffs due to automation ensuing social unrest and the merging of humans and technology as the best case scenario for 2071 Musk AI one world government pose threats to humanity Musk addressed the ongoing rise of artificial intelligence AI and the dangers of a one world government speaking by video to the WGS on Wednesday One of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI Musk told WGS attendees But AI is both positive or negative it has great promise great capability but also with that comes great danger He commented on ChatGPT the increasingly popular AI tool developed by OpenAI Musk co founded OpenAI with former PayPal partner Peter Thiel but has since left its board of directors the New York Post reported ChatGPT I think has illustrated to people just how advanced AI has become AI has been advanced for a while it just didn t have a user interface that was accessible to most people said Musk What ChatGPT has done is just put an accessible user interface on AI technology that has been present for a few years he added Musk called upon governments to develop safety regulations for AI comparing its rise to the development of nuclear technology

aircraft or cars or medicine we have regulatory bodies that oversee the public safety of cars and planes and medicine I think we should have a similar set of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because I think it is actually a bigger risk to society This is not the first time Musk has made such remarks about AI In March 2022 Musk said that artificial intelligence going wrong is one of the three biggest threats facing humanity along with falling birth rates and the rise of religious extremism Others have expressed concerns about AI going wrong alleging that bias is baked into the technology The New York Post reported for instance that ChatGPT refused to write an article about Hunter Biden in the newspaper s critical style but it was willing to write the article from the perspective of CNN Business Insider argues that AI tools like ChatGPT must be woke in order to attract major investors Major investments are pouring into such AI technologies Microsoft announced last month it is investing 10 billion in OpenAI while Google is working on a competitor to ChatGPT known as Bard Musk in his talk to WGS delegates also addressed what he sees as the dangers of one world government I know this is called the World Government Summit but I think we should be maybe a little bit concerned about actually becoming too much of a single world government he said We want to avoid creating a civilizational risk by having frankly this may sound a little odd too much cooperation between governments Instead Musk called for the maintenance of civilizational diversity He said I think we want to be a little bit cautious about being too much of a single civilization because if we are too much of a single civilization then the whole thing may collapse Obviously not suggesting war or anything like that but I think we want to be a little bit wary of actually cooperating too much It sounds a little odd but we want to have some amount of civilizational diversity such that if

legislators to speak authentically Do the tweets yourself and convey your message directly Musk tweeted that he chose to make these remarks at the WGS because it seemed like the right venue He also hinted at his plans for Twitter indicating he expects to find a CEO to succeed him probably toward the end of this year I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it s in a financially healthy place he said I m guessing probably toward the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company Schwab Technology can help the elite be the master of the world Perhaps confirming Musk s fears in his keynote speech to the WGS Schwab said mastering technologies such as AI can help global elite be the master of the world We are at the beginning he said When you look at technology transformation it usually takes place in the terms of an S curve And we are just now where we move into the exponential phase This phase Schwab said requires us to strengthen cooperation and enhance coordination at the level of governments countries and institutions to maintain the frameworks of international cooperation which in turn is reflected in the paths of development comprehensively Schwab referred to the recently concluded WEF annual meeting to contextualize his remarks stating we discussed our ability to adapt to these global challenges in light of various crises that require new mechanisms and innovative methods to help us reach a better future and serve the aspirations of humanity Schwab said the coming decades will witness major structural transformations related to climate change He argued for achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals and reaching zero carbon emissions New technologies said Schwab will continue to play a vital role in these transformations A few years ago we considered some technologies a science fiction that was difficult to implement said Schwab But today it has become a reality that we live through artificial intelligence new space technology and industrial biology which heralds a major change coming during the next 10 years and requires governments to be ambitious in their decisions Schwab heralded AI s

of the world Like Musk he expressed some concerns but his deep concern was that new technologies such as AI might escape the control of the global elite My deep concern is that regarding 4IR technologies if we don t work together on a global scale if we do not formulate shape together the necessary policies they will escape our power to master those technologies he said These same elites must therefore shape the necessary policies to make sure that those technologies serve humankind That s how Schwab said they can show the public which will feel overwhelmed by change because it can t understand really what s going on why those technologies can serve for the good The WEF is an enthusiastic proponent of technologies such as AI and the metaverse Schwab s remarks at the WGS about how new technologies can help the global elite be the master of the world closely mirrored his statements at this year s WEF meeting where he opined what it means to master the future Tedros COVID will not be the last pandemic WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also spoke at the WGS meeting saying that COVID 19 unfortunately will not be the last pandemic or the major health emergency He added Other threats such as climate change will continue to increase in frequency and intensity We owe it to those who we have lost and those who will come after us to learn the lessons and make the changes that should keep the world safer U N Secretary General António Guterres told attendees the world is confronting a confluence of crises unlike any in our lifetimes Conflict is raging poverty and hunger are rising divisions are deepening and the climate emergency keeps worsening he said We have a duty to act We must forge a path towards greater cooperation rooted in solidarity To do so he

answers as to why the NTP chose to stop studying wireless radiation said Eckenfels For instance Wyde s Jan 30 2024 email to the group suggested that the NTP at some point may have had plans to study RFR just not using the new exposure system the researchers tested In the email Wyde proposed a response to Slesin for the group to review and edit However his response included a sentence that had been struck through The omitted sentence said Efforts will be refocused in other areas where contributions can be made to understanding the potential effects of RF exposure on public health No one on the email thread suggested adding the omitted sentence back in The omitted sentence raises questions said Eckenfels Did the NTP have plans to refocus efforts so it could still study the effect of RFR on public health If not why was that sentence ever there in the first place Why was it omitted The emails also showed that NIEHS was initially unresponsive to Slesin when he first asked the agency when and where results from the follow up studies would be made public Slesin first emailed NIEHS Office of Communications and Public Liaison on Jan 17 2024 He wrote What can you tell me about when

range of industries are using emotion artificial intelligence a technology that uses vocal tone facial expressions data from wearable devices and monitors text and how people use their computers to

facial expressions and data from wearable devices as well as text and how people use their computers promising to detect and predict how someone is feeling It is used in contexts both mundane like entertainment and high stakes like the workplace hiring and healthcare A wide range of industries already use emotion artificial intelligence AI including call centers finance banking nursing and caregiving Over 50 of large employers in the U S use emotion AI aiming to infer employees internal states a practice that grew during the COVID 19 pandemic For example call centers monitor what their operators say and their tone of voice Scholars have raised concerns about emotion AI s scientific validity and its reliance on contested theories about emotion They have also highlighted emotion AI s potential for invading privacy and exhibiting racial gender and disability bias Some employers use the technology as though it were flawless while some scholars seek to reduce its bias and improve its validity discredit it altogether or suggest banning emotion AI at least until more is known about its implications I study the social implications of technology I believe that it is crucial to examine emotion AI s implications for people subjected to it such as workers especially those marginalized by their race gender or disability status Workers concerns To understand where emotion AI used in the workplace is going my colleague Karen Boyd and I set out to examine inventors conceptions of emotion AI in the workplace We analyzed patent applications that proposed emotion AI technologies for the workplace Purported benefits claimed by patent applicants included assessing and supporting employee well being ensuring workplace safety increasing productivity and aiding in decision making such as making promotions firing employees and assigning tasks We wondered what workers think about these technologies Would they also perceive these benefits For example would workers find it beneficial for employers to provide well being support to them My collaborators Shanley Corvite Kat Roemmich Tillie Ilana Rosenberg and I conducted a survey partly representative of the U S population and partly oversampled for people of color trans and nonbinary people and people living with mental illness These groups may be more likely to experience harm from emotion AI Our study had 289 participants from

being support and workplace safety mirroring benefits claimed in patent applications all also expressed concerns They were concerned about harm to their well being and privacy harm to their work performance and employment status and bias and mental health stigma against them For example 51 of participants expressed privacy concerns 36 noted the potential for incorrect inferences employers would accept at face value and 33 expressed concern that emotion AI generated inferences could be used to make unjust employment decisions Participants voices One participant who had multiple health conditions said The awareness that I am being analyzed would ironically have a negative effect on my mental health This means that despite emotion AI s claimed goals to infer and improve workers well being in the workplace its use can lead to the opposite effect well being diminished due to a loss of privacy Indeed other work by my colleagues Roemmich Florian Schaub and I suggests that emotion AI induced privacy loss can span a range of privacy harms including psychological autonomy economic relationship physical and discrimination On concerns that emotional surveillance could jeopardize their job a participant with a diagnosed mental health condition said They could decide that I am no longer a good fit at work and fire me Decide I m not capable enough and not give a raise or think I m not working enough Participants in the study also mentioned the potential for exacerbated power imbalances and said they were afraid of the dynamic they would have with employers if emotion AI were integrated into their workplace pointing to how emotion AI use could potentially intensify already existing tensions in the employer worker relationship For instance a respondent said The amount of control that employers already have over employees suggests there would be few checks on how this information would be used Any consent by employees is largely illusory in this context Lastly

their face A system can read faces sure but not minds I just cannot see how this could actually be anything but destructive to minorities in the workplace Participants noted that they would either refuse to work at a place that uses emotion AI an option not available to many or engage in behaviors to make emotion AI read them favorably to protect their privacy One participant said I would exert a massive amount of energy masking even when alone in my office which would make me very distracted and unproductive pointing to how emotion AI use would impose additional emotional labor on workers Worth the harm These findings indicate that emotion AI exacerbates existing challenges experienced by workers in the workplace despite proponents claiming emotion AI helps solve these problems If emotion AI does work as claimed and measures what it claims to measure and even if bias issues are addressed in the future there are still harms experienced by workers such as the additional emotional labor and loss of privacy If these technologies do not measure what they claim or are biased then people are at the mercy of algorithms deemed to be valid and reliable when they are not Workers would still need to expend the effort to try to reduce the chances of being misread by the algorithm or to engage in emotional displays that would read favorably to the algorithm Either way these systems

Frontiers in Public Health reviewed over 100 studies summarizing the link between endocrine disrupting chemicals exposure and reproductive effects in women including infertility endometriosis premature ovarian insufficiency or POI and endocrine axis dysregulation You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up In a Frontiers in Public Health review article researchers report on the wide body of science connecting adverse effects to the female reproductive system such as infertility with exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals or EDCs The authors call these effects a significant concern for public health as there has been growing evidence of EDCs with risk factors for decreased fertility Infertility affects a substantial proportion of the world s population with approximately one in six people affected the researchers note They continue Over the last 70 years global fertility has been constantly in decline due to behavioral and societal changes emerging evidence has shown that infertility incidence is linked to exposure to environmental factors such as tobacco alcohol and a wide range of endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs including pesticides chlorpyrifos glyphosate dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT and methoxychlor phthalates polychlorinated biphenyls PCB dioxins and bisphenols In this review over 100 studies are summarized to showcase the link between EDC exposure and reproductive effects in women including infertility and related diseases such as endometriosis premature ovarian insufficiency or POI and endocrine axis dysregulation The studies included investigating the mechanisms by which EDCs cause ovarian aging folliculogenesis decrease of oocyte quality ovulation disorders development and receptivity of endometrium endometriosis fetal development abnormalities and epigenetics modulation the authors state Results from these studies show exposure to EDCs can lead to infertility and reproductive effects through various mechanisms Altering the balance of any endocrines that impact reproduction can change fertilization outcomes The researchers say One of the most described mechanisms is when EDCs mimic hormones such as estrogen and bind to their receptors leading to hormonal disruption This can alter the ovulation process The authors note Additionally oxidative stress in ovarian tissues that damages cells and impairs their function is induced by several EDCs Thus EDCs disrupt the development of ovarian follicles and can be directly toxic to gametes decreasing their numbers and quality These mechanisms all together lead to abnormalities such as blocked Fallopian tubes ovarian disorder uterine disorders failure to produce an oocyte abnormal oocyte quality local inflammation and endocrine

anomalies will lead to significantly lower pregnancy rates Atrazine a widely used herbicide is a common environmental contaminant known with EDC effect and reproductive toxicity Endosulfan exposure reduces the expression of the primary endometrial markers of receptivity such as MUC1 HOXA10 Inn and E cadherin and affects the normal endometrial receptivity impairing the adhesion and the implantation process of the blastocyst Placenta anomalies which lead to pre eclampsia abnormal fetal development miscarriage and placental disruption can occur with EDC exposure as the placenta is vulnerable to endocrine disruption due to a large presence of hormone receptors and a lack of enzymatic machinery to guard against EDCs This study also finds that organochlorine pesticides impair placenta ability to produce and release hormones and enzymes transport nutrients or produce waste They contribute to preterm birth by disrupting the balance between P4 and E2 during pregnancy Epigenetic patterns can be deregulated by altering methylation enzymes DNMTs and DNA demethylation enzymes e g ten eleven translocation TET proteins from EDC exposure Methoxychlor and DDT gestational exposure correlates to ovary diseases studies here and here DDT is also linked to impaired fetal growth and metabolic dysfunction which can possibly lead to miscarriage Almost all major classes of EDCs can target the estrogen pathways as many EDCs display estrogenic activity and can affect both genetic and epigenetic levels See studies here here and here As the researchers conclude from these results The impact of EDCs extends beyond lowering the rate of a successful pregnancy and increasing the risk of miscarriage in women they also impair the future reproductive health of the fetus Infants and children are at a disproportionate risk with pesticide exposure as this is a critical developmental window Chemical exposure during this window can lead to lasting health effects into adulthood The authors note that The reach of EDCs to the embryo by transplacental transfer can lead to genome alteration during embryonic germ cell precursors reprogramming These epigenetic

with the body s hormones which are part of the endocrine system These chemicals are associated with a wide array of health issues Endocrine glands distributed throughout the body produce the hormones that act as signaling molecules after release into the circulatory system The human body is dependent on hormones for a healthy endocrine system which controls many biological processes like normal
