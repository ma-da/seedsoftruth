The newspapers reported a “mysterious telephone caller” who had called several of Dr. Sherman’s close friends to say, “You’re next.” The voice was male. Other developments were reported: Her car was found eight blocks away. A palm print was recovered from the car, but could not be identified. The car key was recovered from a neighboring lawn. Partial results of the autopsy leaked to the press: “Though Dr. Sherman’s body had been mutilated, there was no evidence that she had been raped.” Her body was held for ten days at the morgue and was then sent out of town for cremation. Having now ruled out burglary as a motive, homicide officers proceeded “on the presumption that the killer was an acquaintance of the fifty-one-year-old widow.” The press said, “Neighbors, relatives, and friends are being questioned, and police are ruling out no possibility as to the identity of the killer, the motive, or his method of entering the apartment.” Police told reporters they suspected “Everybody and nobody.” Over the next two weeks, “professional associates and social acquaintances” were interviewed by the police. The reported number grew to over 100 by August 3 and topped off at 150. On August 5, the Times-Picayune announced, Concurrent with the newspaper articles, rumors spread like wildfire, and influenced the public’s perception of Mary Sherman’s murder. By nine o’clock on the morning of the murder, the word had already spread throughout the offices of the New Orleans newspapers that there had been a lesbian sex killing in the uptown area. This is interesting, since the autopsy, which determined the cause of death and which discovered the laceration to her sexual organs, did not even begin until 9:15 a.m.7 Six weeks after the murder, in early September 1964, I personally heard another rumor about a female orthopedic surgeon killed over the summer. The source of this was a teacher welcoming our class back from summer holiday. In his version, she had been murdered by Communists. This was a head-scratcher, even in 1964. “What is the world coming to?” he asked us. I couldn’t understand why the Communists would want to kill an orthopedic surgeon. And since my father was an orthopedic surgeon, I wondered if the Communists had any interest in killing him, too. While researching this book, I wrote that teacher a letter about his comments made decades ago. He remembered the incident, and talked about the doctor’s “dark side” and her association with “gay Mexicanos.” Such was the word-of-mouth on the streets of New Orleans in 1964. In 1992, I set out to get copies of the police reports. With the help of the NOPD item number (G-12994-64), I found them in the City Archives of the New Orleans Public Library.

In 1992, I set out to get copies of the police reports. With the help of the NOPD item number (G-12994-64), I found them in the City Archives of the New Orleans Public Library. There were two reports. One was the Precinct Report, promptly written and filed by the street cops who first arrived at her apartment that July morning; the other was a Supplementary Report written by the Homicide Department months after the investigation had subsided. The Precinct Report was signed and approved by all parties. The Homicide Report was not. It was only signed by the officer who prepared it and was then filed without being co-signed or approved. I consider this violation of basic procedure extremely unusual for such a high-profile case. From the Precinct Report we get a straightforward view of the post-call events at the crime scene. The police arrived and were met by Juan Valdez, who told them he thought the smoke was coming through the ventilation ducts from another apartment. A search of the various apartments found the door to the patio of Apartment J ajar, and the sliding door entrance to the apartment open one to two inches. Inside, the living room was full of smoke. The police called the fire department. Valdez told the police it was Mary Sherman’s apartment, and brought them a wet towel to use as a gas mask, but they were unable to penetrate the smoke of the apartment. They waited for the fire department to arrive, and to remove the smoldering mattress using oxygen masks. When the smoke cleared, they found a body lying on the floor next to the bed. Their report said, A preliminary examination by Dr. LoCascio on the scene determined that there were several possible stab wounds of the left arm of the body, which had not been deteriorated by the fire. There also appeared to be several stab wounds in the torso. There was also a large wound of the inside of the right thigh just above the knee. From further examination of the body, it was noted by the coroner that the right arm and a portion of the right side of the body extending from the right hip to the right shoulder was completely burned away exposing various vital organs. The body was removed from the apartment and taken to the Coroner’s office. The other residents in the building were all questioned. None heard anything between the time they retired and the time the police arrived, except one who heard Juan Valdez walking around his apartment before the police arrived. From Elmener Peterson, Mary’s housekeeper, police learned that the burglar alarm was in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:77:3261cf989491", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3007, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "extending from the right hip to the right shoulder was completely burned away exposing various vital organs.

From Elmener Peterson, Mary’s housekeeper, police learned that the burglar alarm was in the “off” position, that Dr. Sherman was “expecting visitors from out of town,” and that she had laid out a polka dot dress, which they found lying on a chair in the bedroom. As to the issue of whether the intruder had forced the door open, the report says, The cause of death was also given to Patn. Knight by Capt. Stevens as follows: 1. Stab wound of the chest, penetrating the heart, hemopericardium and left hemithorax [sic] 2. Multiple stab wounds of the abdomen, with incid wound of the liver. 3. Multiple stab wounds of the left upper extremity and the right leg. 4. Laceration of Labia Minora. 5. Extreme burns of right side of body with complete destruction of right upper extremity and right side of thorax and abdomen. Now we look at the Homicide Report, a baffling document written in two parts. The first half, covering the crime scene, was completed on October 29, 1964, approximately ten weeks after the police stopped their investigation. The second half was dated several days later, on November 3, 1964. The report should have been signed by both investigators, Detective Frank Hayward and Detective Robert Townsend, Jr., and their supervisor, Lt. James Kruebbe. But there is only one signature, that of Detective Robert Townsend, Jr. The extreme delay in preparing this report and this unusual violation of a basic procedure show that, for some reason, this was not an ordinary report. My guess is that it was not signed by his co-investigator and supervisor for a reason. Perhaps they refused to sign it in protest. Perhaps they filed it without signing it so they could say they never saw it. Perhaps Townsend filed it himself, just to put something in the file. Who knows? I tried to contact Townsend to find out, but he did not return the calls. This report begins with recounting the same events as the Precinct Report, except told from the perspective of the homicide team. As they arrived, they found the firemen cleaning up debris. They instructed them to stop and to leave all debris where they had placed it, so that the homicide team could inspect it and see what was being removed from the crime scene.

(This is an important detail.) Then they described what they saw: The undersigned entered Apt. J. from the patio, the only entrance to said apartment, into the living room area. Said apartment was composed of a living room, kitchen, bathroom, study, and a bedroom…. Located in the bedroom, was the body of a white female, apparently dead, later learned to be one Dr. Mary Stults Sherman, WF, 51 yrs., formerly residing 3101 St. Charles Ave., Apt. J., who lived alone…. The body was in a supine position, the head in the direction of the river, the feet in the direction of the lake, and both legs were outstretched and parallel to each other… The left arm was outstretched and parallel to the left side of the body. The right side of the body from the waist to where the right shoulder would be, including the whole right arm, was apparently disintegrated from the fire, yielding the inside organs of the body. There was what appeared to be a stab wound in the left arm and also in the inner side of the right leg near the knee. The body was nude; however, there was clothing which had apparently been placed on top of the body, mostly covering the body from just above the pubic area to the neck. Some of the mentioned clothes had been burned completely, while others were still intact, but scorched. Sam Moran, the investigator from the Coroner’s office who later erroneously told the press that the front door had been forced open and that the burglar had unsuccessfully tried to open the jewelry box, arrived, looked around, and then left with Mary’s jewelry box, purse, check book and other personal items, including thirteen keys on a key ring found in the kitchen. At the morgue, the autopsy was performed by Dr. Samuels, a pathologist, who told police (1) the victim died prior to the fire, (2) the victim had not been raped, and (3) the victim was dead before the laceration to the labia minora was inflicted. When the Coroner’s officials examined the clothing piled on Dr. Sherman’s body, they noted, “Most of the clothes were still neatly folded when placed on top of the body.” The criminologist observed that these clothes were composed of a synthetic material which would ignite into a flame at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. At lower temperatures they would have only smoldered.

Seven percent of the Homicide Report discussed John, a “Peeping Tom” who had ogled a twenty-six-year-old woman in Dr. Sherman’s apartment complex six months earlier. He had since moved across town. His activities on the evening of July 20 were accounted for and supported by credible witnesses. The report clearly stated where he was employed, at a local vending machine company. The objective of this section seems to be to imply that sex crimes did occur in Mary’s neighborhood. Twenty percent of the report discussed Jane, a young woman from New Jersey with short red hair and toreador pants, who walked past Sherman’s building around midnight, apparently on her way to a lesbian rendezvous in the French Quarter. The girl stopped in to see the night watchman across the street from Mary’s apartment so she could make a phone call. She had nothing to do with the case, but the report clearly said where she was employed, at a theater on Canal Street. The objective of this section seems to be to point out that lesbians did live in (or at least walk through) Mary’s neigh- had not seen her in nine months. She used to stop by and discuss the theater and literature with him. Due to his fondness for her, Max became depressed after one of her visits and wrote her a letter asking her not to return. Max described her as a “lesbian who lived in grand fashion.” When the police asked Max how he knew she was a lesbian, he said he “had known a lesbian once in Venice,” but “he did not concern himself with such matters.” Speaking in a “very dramatic” voice to Detective Hayward, Max called her death a “delegated suicide.” He said, “She seemed to be torn within herself; that there was something bothering her; that was destroying her,” and if the investigators “would wait, it would be disclosed because this would be the ‘grand finale’ Mary Sherman would want.” One has to wonder how much of Max’s description was based upon his own depression rather than on Mary’s. We know that Max was self-employed as an author. The objective of this section seems to be to show that at least one of the 150 people interviewed called her a lesbian, though his grounds for doing so are admittedly weak. So let’s add them up: 7% + 20% + 10% = 37%. .

Carolyn Talley Identified Body Tulane MedicalSchool Juan Valdez Called police InternationalTrade Mart Another person was included in the report because he supposedly helped explain Mary’s movements in the hours before her death. Here comes David Gentry, 4919 Magazine St., who sold Mary an ashtray following her dental appointment the afternoon before her murder. (The dentist’s name, however, was not mentioned.) One has to wonder if the police were aware that Mr. Gentry lived next door to, and was acquainted with, Lee Harvey Oswald, when Oswald lived at The only professional associate of Dr. Sherman that is mentioned in the report is Dr. Carolyn Talley, and that was unavoidable because she identified the body for the police, based on shape and hair color. For some reason Talley called Sherman’s apartment at 5:00 a.m. the morning of the murder. No explanation of this phone call was given in the police report. My guess is that Talley, a pediatrician, was going to drive to the Crippled Children’s Hospital across the lake with Dr. Sherman later that morning, and that she called at ${ 5 { : 0 0 } \\bf { A . M } }$ . to give her a wake-up call so they could get an early start and avoid getting stuck in the morning traffic and the July heat. Keith’s article pointed out that the sex-murder rumor was well in place before 9:15 a.m. on July 21, when the autopsy began. Keith also considered the word “mutilation” to be “too strong” for the one centimeter cut on the victim’s labia. Forensically speaking, genital mutilation would suggest the killer was a man, not a woman. Quoting from his article, “Instances in which women have mutilated the genitalia of other women are so rare as to practically be unheard of.” From my perspective, the most important point in Keith’s article was calling attention to the fact that the police reports omitted the victim’s place of employment. Why would the police not want to tell us the victim ran a cancer laboratory for Dr. Alton Ochsner? All of which was kind of silly, since that information was on the front page of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:81:ee6bafcc4f7b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3011, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "in which women have mutilated the genitalia of other women are so rare as to practically be unheard of.” From my perspective, the most important point in Keith’s article was calling attention to the fact that the police reports omitted the victim’s place of employment. Why would the police not want to tell us the victim ran a cancer laboratory for Dr. Alton Ochsner? All of which was kind of silly, since that information was on the front page of both newspapers. This omission can only have been intentional. Keith also observed that Warren Commission investigators started taking their testimony in New Orleans on the morning of July 21, 1964, several hours after Mary Sherman’s murder. Some consider this coincidental timing suspicious, and have speculated that her death may have somehow been related to the Kennedy assassination or to her association with David Ferrie. A few JFK assassination researchers have mentioned Mary Sherman in their writings. John Davis, author of Mafia Kingfish, called Mary Sherman “David Ferrie’s closest female friend,”11 and raised the possibility that her death might have been related to Ferrie’s death. But Davis had the date of her death wrong, and thought that she had died shortly after Ferrie in 1967. For a more obvious error, we look at the work of Gerald Posner, who wrote a book called Case Closed, which argued that Oswald was the lone assassin of JFK. Posner ended his book with a chapter called “The Non-Mysterious Mystery Deaths,” to supposedly dismiss a host of ill-conceived theories. There he said, Credentials mean little to me. I have seen terrible people carry impressive diplomas and fancy titles, and I have seen great people with neither. The few clues I had about Mary’s personal life told me little. The suicide of her husband and the painting of suffering on her wall told of her emotional hurt. But how did she manifest this? In malice, or charity, or both? Was she a childless, sadomasochistic lesbian witch who tried to become a goddess by developing her own life form? Or was she a deep, sensitive, honest caring physician who struggled to find a cure for cancer? Or was she a nonjudgmental scientist who had simply been manipulated into doing things which finally brought about her own demise? I did not know. But I wanted to find out. Sherman’s building. It was Alvin Alcorn, “colored, male, age 51.” He had known Dr. Sherman for twelve years and was one of the last people to see her alive. At 4 : 00 P.M . he saw her standing on her patio talking to her housekeeper of twelve years, Elmener Peterson, also “colored,” as they insisted on reporting. As Alcorn left, he noticed that Dr. Sherman’s car was in the parking lot as usual, and confirmed such to police once they needed to know. Alvin Alcorn?

As Alcorn left, he noticed that Dr. Sherman’s car was in the parking lot as usual, and confirmed such to police once they needed to know. Alvin Alcorn? Alcorn played so many parties for fraternities and faculty at Tulane that many considered him “the house band.” By the spring of 1987, when we met accidently at an outdoor function for the New Orleans Museum of Art, he was semi-retired and only played sporadically. His band had just finished performing, but I had missed them. I was waiting outside for my family, and he was walking about in the same area. After a while we started talking. He was warm, sensitive, perceptive, and completely devoid of any sense of “jive.” I knew if this was the same Alvin Alcorn, and if he was still alive, that he could give me a clean read on Mary Sherman, at least the parts he knew about. I grabbed my old New Orleans phone book, found his number, and called him. Yes, he was alive, now in his eighties, but still quite alert. I confirmed that he was “Alvin Alcorn the musician,” and reminded him that we had met several years before. When he heard I was calling from Detroit, he insisted on reminiscing about his younger days, touring with the big bands and playing at the Graystone Ball Room in downtown Detroit. Then I changed subjects, and asked him if he had ever been to the Patio Apartments on St. Charles Avenue. Soon I was in New Orleans and found his house, a small wooden shotgun design on the edge of town. Inside the low iron gate, six cats slept lazily on an old sofa on the porch. One moved away quietly when I entered. I knocked and knocked, but there was no answer. I had walked through fifteen blocks of low-income housing to find the house and was not anxious to walk back empty handed. After five minutes I resigned myself and started to leave. As I closed the gate, a faint “Hello” came from the screen door. Alvin was standing at the front door. Bent with age and holding a cane, he softly said, “I was in the back. Come in.” His fragile steps shuffled into the front room. Each step was an effort. He balanced himself with a cane as his slippers slid across the wooden floor three inches at a time. He gestured to the sofa, and I took a seat. He negotiated into position in front of his easy chair and lowered himself into a spot where he was sure to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:83:eca0362822d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3013, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "Bent with age and holding a cane, he softly said, “I was in the back.

The house, heated like many in New Orleans by open gas flame, was about eighty degrees. The air was stale. He was obviously quite comfortable, but I was about to melt. I figured I’d better start talking while I could. We chatted about his music career. He told his favorite stories in a gentle voice spiced with laughter. Then I asked him if he remembered Mary Sherman. “She was a fine woman, a damn fine woman,” he said without hesitation, challenging anyone to disagree. “Good hearted.” That’s what he meant to say the first time. “She was good to people. Good to me and good to Elmener.” His head shook up and down slowly as he considered his words. Yes, they were the right ones. Then he grew still and gave me a quizzical look, asking me without any words, why, after nearly thirty years, was I asking about Dr. Sherman. “I don’t know,” he said simply, knowing that he had asked himself the same question and wished he had a better answer. “But I hope you catch the son-of- ^(a) -bitch.” There was no hiding the hatred in his voice. He would have gladly beaten the killer with his cane. He told me all I needed to know about Mary Sherman in a few sentences. 9 Who was the Juan Valdez that reported the fire in Mary Sherman’s apartment? Researcher Joan Mellen in her book Farewell to Justice said that this same Juan Valdez worked for Clay Shaw at the International Trade Mart. Further, Mellen reports that she was told that Lee Harvey Oswald was well-acquainted with a Cuban named Juan Valdez. Locating a Cuban who knew both Clay Shaw and Lee Oswald, and who lived next to Mary Sherman, might be very important. So New Orleans journalist Don Lee Keith tried to find Juan Valdez to talk to him. Keith told me that he had searched all over the country for Mary Sherman’s neighbor. After interviewing 34 people without success, Keith finally gave up, and questioned whether “Juan Valdez” was really his name. But the spelling of Juan Valdez’s name has always been in question and may explain why he had been so difficult to locate. While the newspapers referred to him as “Juan Valdez,” the NOPD Homicide Report used another common variation of Valdez and spelled his name as “Juan Valdes” with an “s”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:84:85dfb1944d8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3014, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "searched all over the country for Mary Sherman’s neighbor.

While the newspapers referred to him as “Juan Valdez,” the NOPD Homicide Report used another common variation of Valdez and spelled his name as “Juan Valdes” with an “s” instead of a ^(′′)Z^(′′), and said that he was a 34- year-old male who lived in Apt. E. But maybe both spellings were wrong. Maybe the correct spelling was yet another variation of the common Spanish surname: “Valadez” with an “A” in the middle. We don’t know that answer, but we do note that in 2001 the bulletin of The World Trade Center of New Orleans said that “on October 11, Mr. Juan Valadez, an international security consultant and retired U.S. intelligence officer… made a presentation… for international travelers and businesses.” Later the vigilant Romney Stubbs sent me a newspaper article from New Orleans about this same Juan Valadez, now of New Orleans, which listed the 30 years he worked for the CIA among his many credentials. Did this Juan Valadez work at the International Trade Mart in New Orleans in 1963 and live in the apartment complex with Mary Sherman? If “yes,” it means that the man who called the police to report the fire in Mary Sherman’s apartment was a CIA agent. This is such an important issue that it deserves a better determination than I can provide here. No, I have not contacted the retired CIA officer to ask him about any contact he may have had with Lee Harvey Oswald or Mary Sherman. But I wish HSCA or ARRB had. Due to the importance of this question, it would be best to get the answer under oath. Doing so would minimize speculation about the similar sounding names and the possible role of the CIA. By the Fall of 1979, I found myself in the Graduate School of Tulane University, enrolled in its Latin was Political Science. Our story picks up in a seminar called the “Urbanization of Latin America,” taught by William Bertrand, Ph.D., from the faculty of Tulane University’s School of Public Health. William “Billy” Bertrand was a great professor by any measure, probably the best I encountered in my years of college and graduate school. He possessed a brilliant analytical mind, a deep commitment, a positive sociable style, and a gift for presenting the most complex subjects in simple language. Professionally, he was an epidemic fighter, thoroughly schooled in the most advanced techniques of statistics, medicine, and sociology in order to battle deadly epidemics around the globe.

This ex-Marine personally traveled from continent to continent witnessing the ravages of disease, be they in Africa or Ecuador. A typical summer assignment for Bertrand would be six weeks in remote regions of Zaire trying to sort out the path of transmission of some mindboggling illness. He occasionally suffered terrible infections from these Third World trips, all of which he seemed to take in stride. In my opinion, there’s not a medical school or university in the world that would not benefit from having a professional of his caliber and character on their staff. Bertrand came from the simple, commonfolk background of south Louisiana. His name “Bertrand” is a Cajun name, like Boudreaux or Bordelon. (He was not related to the infamous Clay Bertrand from the Warren Commission volumes.) Like his black hair, black eyes, and rounded features, it was proof that he was really from the core of French Acadian settlers of southern Louisiana. Bertrand used to say that he could walk from New Orleans to Houston, staying at a different relative’s house every night, and that he unplugged his telephone for two weeks before Mardi Gras to keep his myriad of country cousins from calling him for a place to stay. These anecdotes were typical of his warm, personable style. He was very popular with the students. The urbanization seminar was held in Tulane’s main library, directly across the street from the law school. The seminar room itself was on a second or third floor in a windowless room toward the center of the building. It was a graduate-level course, with about eight graduate students and one or two undergraduates. About half of the students in this particular seminar were from Latin America. There were lots of affluent and well-connected Latins at Tulane. I personally knew students from Cuba (exiles), Costa Rica, Columbia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Belize, and Panama. I remember one of the Latins in Bertrand’s seminar particularly clearly. I will call him Freckles, because his face was covered with them. He seemed younger than I, say early twenties at the time, medium height, slender build, quiet, and with a hard edge about him. He was always vague about his national origin, but he was very clear about his politics: He was an avid anti-Communist. Freckles was the only person in class who routinely let his personal political views get in the way of his academic work. Bertrand stopped him on more than one occasion, saying, “That sounds like a personal political", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:86:d23ffaed2cc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3016, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "seemed younger than I, say early twenties at the time, medium height, slender build, quiet, and with a hard edge about him.

Freckles was the only person in class who routinely let his personal political views get in the way of his academic work. Bertrand stopped him on more than one occasion, saying, “That sounds like a personal political opinion.” Admittedly, it’s hard to discuss the urbanization of Latin America or the dynamics of development in the Third World without discussing politics, but efforts were generally made in academic circles to stay as objective as possible. One day Bertrand was leading the seminar’s discussion on educational challenges in the Third World. He made the point that one of the problems that both socialistic and capitalistic governments faced when trying to educate their population was that education (investment in people) was ultimately “capital intensive,” meaning that the investment (school buildings, books, teachers, etc.) must be paid before the benefit of the education (skilled labor, social services, etc.) can be reaped. The point that socialists needed capital in order to achieve their objectives sparked a lot of discussion. It defied the black-and-white rhetoric which characterized much of Latin American political debate. As the discussion progressed, Cuba was mentioned repeatedly, since it was the only functioning socialist government in Latin America. And Cuba was a touchy subject. To many Latins, Castro was an anti-gringo politician, and in their eyes that made him a Latin hero, which they liked. But to others, he was a thief, a murderer, and a criminal. The latter group were generally Cubans, since many of them had seen their family fortunes ruined and, in some cases, their families killed at the hands of Castro’s revolutionaries. • Its location gave it valuable economic interests and contacts. New Orleans is both the mouth of the Mississippi River (the largest commercial waterway in the United States) and the northern port of the Caribbean. Until recently, it was the commercial gateway to Latin America. Lumber, sugar, coffee, and bananas flowed into the U.S. through New Orleans, while machinery, money, and medical services flowed back. • Tulane was respected academically. For over 100 years Tulane Medical School has specialized in fighting the diseases which plague the tropics. This ripe history is studded with major scientific accomplishments. For example, it was Tulane that helped to prove malaria was spread by mosquitoes, at a time when that defied mainstream scientific thinking. This discovery had an enormous positive impact on public health in Latin America. Consequently, Tulane was widely recognized as a top academic tire Western Hemisphere, and when combined with Cuba’s confiscation of American assets after the revolution, it triggered the most tenacious economic boycott in American history. This embargo crippled the Cuban economy.

This embargo crippled the Cuban economy. Add to that years of U.S.-sponsored covert warfare waged against Cuba (from blowing up Cuban oil refineries to infecting Cuban livestock with viruses), and it is amazing Castro’s government survived at all. In any event, the discussion in the seminar turned to “It’s really too bad about Castro.” Not only had his relationship with the Soviet Union allied him with a totalitarian Communist state and presented him as a military threat to the United States, but it also tainted his socialism. It was difficult to judge whether socialism was right or wrong for Latin America on the basis of Soviet missiles. It would be much simpler if Castro was not around — or so the discussion went. Then the inevitable discussion of how to assassinate Castro started. No one even suggested that the U.S. had not been trying, despite the fact that assassinating a foreign head of state was explicitly illegal. After all, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee had already disclosed numerous CIA attempts to assassinate Castro. The conversation covered the predictable escalating path from shoot him, to bomb him, to poison him, to the more exotic methods like blowing up his cigar. It ended with the classic exasperation, “They ought to be able to come up with something to get rid of him!” At this point, Freckles, who was sitting directly to Bertrand’s right, turned to him and said in a confidential tone, “El Padrino is working on a virus.” Bertrand’s surprise was both immediate and obvious. He was half-appalled and half-confused. Freckles had used this Spanish word for godfather in a manner that assumed Bertrand knew whom he was talking about, even if the rest of us didn’t. But Bertrand did not recognize the name and paused to unravel the comment. Then he said, in an incredulous voice, “Who?” Bertrand was stunned and went straight into deep thought to calculate the comment. Ochsner was a very powerful man in Tulane circles. A single unthoughtful comment about Tulane’s wealthiest and most powerful medical figure could institution among educated Latins. It was politically correct for the Latin American elite to send their children to Tulane to be educated. Tulane had exquisite “anti-Communist” credentials.

Samuel Zemurray, president of the incredibly powerful United Fruit Company during the 1950s, was a New Orleans native, and became Chairman of Tulane University’s Board of Directors. As Chairman, Zemurray stacked the Tulane Board with United Fruit officers. After he died, Zemurray’s ornate mansion on St. Charles Avenue became the residence of the president of Tulane University. United Fruit was actually a Boston-based company which had controlled the Central American fruit business with an iron hand for nearly a century, and was at the center of the Cold War conflict in Central America. To illustrate its influence, consider Guatemala. When the democratically elected government of Guatemala purchased 250,000 acres of undeveloped land from United Fruit in 1954, the American government responded with a CIA-organized coup d’etat which ousted President Arbenz.1 Allen Dulles (who later became CIA Director), his brother John Foster Dulles (the U.S. Secretary of State) and Sam Zemurray were all major stockholders in United Fruit.2 • Tulane was well promoted in the region, especially by Dr. Alton Ochsner, who was Chief of Surgery of Tulane Medical School. Ochsner traveled Latin America from Mexico to Argentina giving lectures. The implied message: If you are too sick for your local doctors, come to New Orleans, and we’ll take care of you. ruin a career. And what if this student’s comment was accurate? We could see the mood on Bertrand’s face change, as the idea of unleashing a designer virus on the Caribbean took hold in the mind of someone who had witnessed horrible epidemics firsthand. We all waited for him to speak. Then in a voice more serious than any I had ever heard him use, he said to Freckles, “If I were you, I’d be very careful who I said that to.” Fitzgerald’s offices were on historic St. Charles Avenue between the New Orleans Central Business District and the Garden District. From my sixth-floor window I could see the statue of Robert E. Lee standing on his lonely column, high above Lee Circle. The statue faced north, it was said, because Robert E. Lee would never turn his back on the South. Below, the antique green streetcars clamored down the grass median of St. Charles Avenue, clanking and hissing their way through the perpetual humidity and circling beneath his feet.

A few blocks down St. Charles Avenue I could see the leafy green trees of Lafayette Square, a lush urban park flanked by large Greek Revival buildings. On the northeast corner of Lafayette Square stood the new Hale Boggs Federal Building, towering over an urban streetmall bordered by Camp and Lafayette Streets. This had been the site of the old Newman Building. On the sidewalk in front of the Boggs Building was a bronze plaque removed from the walls of the Newman Building. The plaque commemorated the military and financial support given by the people of New Orleans to the In 1963, the Newman building held the offices of “private detective” Guy Banister, former head of the FBI’s Chicago office4 and later Deputy Chief of the New Orleans Police Department. Banister was a staunch segregationist and founded the ultra-right-wing Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean. He claimed to have the largest file sys- In the blocks surrounding Lafayette Square were the local offices of the FBI, the CIA, and the Secret Service. Across the square from Banister sat Chairman Hebert of the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, whose job it was to prepare the U.S. military’s budget for Congress’ approval and to hide the CIA’s budget from both Soviet and American scrutiny.7 One block away was the Reily Coffee Company where Lee Harvey Oswald worked. The address stamped on the famous “Hands Off Cuba” flyers that Oswald handed out that hot August day in 1963 was 544 Camp Street: the Newman Building. Banister’s wife found similar flyers in her husband’s office after his death. Garrison concluded that Oswald was involved with both Banister and Ferrie during the summer of 1963, and that Banister was Oswald’s “handler” who arranged events,8 such as the trip to the mental hospital, to make Oswald later appear to be a convincing political assassin.9 In the early 1980s Fitzgerald was the largest advertising agency in Louisiana, with impressive credentials. Among its long list of well-respected clients was the Reily Coffee Company. Fitzgerald was conservative and “old school” by all definitions of the term. Like many ad agencies, Fitzgerald was occasionally asked by clients or influential citizens to work on pet projects, and they tried to oblige when they could. One day, in the summer of 1982, one of my bosses called me to his office shortly before lunch. As I entered, he asked if I knew so-and-so. The name was not familiar to me. He laughed a little and muttered: “You’re one of the lucky ones.” I joined him in a polite laugh, as he made light of his comment.

He laughed a little and muttered: “You’re one of the lucky ones.” I joined him in a polite laugh, as he made light of his comment. Then he began his solicitation in earnest, explaining that he had received an inquiry from “a friend of the agency” that we had to respond to. He wanted me to check it out. He said that it was “right up my alley,” and wanted me to go see whether the agency should get involved. He handed me a small yellow slip of paper torn from an office pad with an address, but no name, written on it in pencil. He instructed me to be there at 1:45 that afternoon. “They” would explain what they wanted. He then sent me on my way, reminding me to be “on time” for the meeting. These were very “busy people.” All I could tell by his tone was that he considered this to be an important courtesy call, but that he was not seriously interested in the project. Given that the advertising business depends upon clear and precise instructions, the ones he gave me that day were remarkably vague. I grabbed a quick bite to eat and caught the next streetcar to Canal Street, wondering all the time where I was going. Canal Street was bleached white hot by the midday sun. A sweaty crowd pushed down the sidewalk into the front door of the street car. Loiterers monopolized the scarce shade. I unfolded my yellow piece of paper to get my bearings. Comparing the address to the nearest storefront, I realized my destination was across the street (on the edge of the French Quarter) and in the next block. Quickly calculating the approximate location, I headed for the ornate Maison Blanche building. Entering the brass and marble lobby of the Maison Blanche building, I savored the cool blast of air-conditioning and immediately inspected the tenant roster to figure out the identity of my mysterious destination. After a minute I realized there was no such suite. I was in the wrong building. So I went back on the street and carefully compared the numbers from my yellow paper with the numbers above the doorways. My destination was next door. The entrance led to a small, dark, narrow, unadorned lobby. It was dark and dingy by comparison to the bright, shiny lobby of the Maison Blanche building. I felt like I was going in a side entrance. This was a building I had never been in before.

I felt like I was going in a side entrance. This was a building I had never been in before. I took the elevator to the top floor and started my search for the suite. As I walked the empty halls, I sensed the strange orientation of the horseshoe-shaped building. The elevators were obviously an after-thought, attached to the end of one of the horseshoe legs, rather than in the center. It was an old building, with chest-high marble walls and frosted glass doors. Many of the suites were vacant. I saw no one in the hall. Turn after turn, I looked for the number. Finally, at the farthest end of the third hall from the elevator, I found a plain windowless door. There was no identification other than the suite number. I knocked. Suddenly a door opened from the side of the reception area and an older man came in swiftly. He was in his sixties, with silver hair, a striped cotton suit, and a bowtie. His sudden entrance startled the younger man, who scrambled to conjure an important air in his voice to introduce him. The older man waved him off and introduced himself: “Hello, I’m Bill Fergerson. Thanks for coming.” His eyes sparkled with practiced warmth. Out the corner of my eye I saw the quick jerk of the young man’s head and the surprised expression on his face when the old man announced his name. The odds were even that he had given me a false name. My immediate read on the situation was that this older man was well known in town and, for some reason, wanted to keep his real name out of the conversation. This was consistent with the secretive nature of the invitation, the virtually unmarked office, and the fact that the younger man had not given me his name either. It was obvious that they wanted to talk to me about something sensitive. At this point I understood the pecking order pretty clearly. Whoever this younger guy was, he had been around for a long time but only in a marginal role. He obviously did not have the complete confidence of the senior members and did not really understand their operation as well as he thought. Then they had a brief conversation about what should happen next. There were some people they wanted me to meet, and they had some things they wanted to show me. They decided to show me “the operation” first and then meet the people. I remember the younger man agreeing, “Yes, the effect would be better.” What effect?

I was standing in a seedy, unmarked office that seriously needed a decorator with two men who did not want me to know their names. Was I supposed to be impressed by something? Or even astonished? I waited to see what they had up their sleeves. As the older man left the room, he said he would be back in a minute. Curious about both my host, my location, and the reason for my visit, I turned to the younger man and said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name.” He said it was not important. I smiled at him and said, “Then why don’t you give me your first name? If you’re going to be showing me around, I don’t want to have to say, ‘Hey, you!’” We went back into the hall and through a door to our right. There we found a modest recording studio with an antiquated control room. The vintage microphone reminded me of something Frank Sinatra would have used. The multichannel mixing board was the same model as the one I had used at Tulane’s radio station. And there was this cheap office desk that had a huge American eagle sculpture attached to the front of it. The desk was almost comical. The eagle’s wings were as wide as the desk. Whoever sat at the desk would look like they were riding on the eagle’s back. What an image for a freedom writer! I was getting the picture. Next we went to a room full of file cabinets and storage shelves. The shelves were stacked with audio and video tapes. My host described them as interviews with Cuban exiles and American political leaders. These tapes were clearly labeled and well organized. Then he started to explain what they wanted. They were trying to revive the station and were hoping our agency might help them promote it. At this point the older man came into the room. He interrupted without hesitating and asked the younger man if he had locked the door to the hall. He said he thought so, but the older man insisted he double check it. I was left alone with the older man for a minute and took the time to observe him more closely. He was about five-feet eight-inches and moved about constantly.

He was obviously very respectable, but not overly concerned about his appearance. The hair on the back of his head was messed up like it had been blown in the wind, and he had not bothered to comb it. The back of his cotton suit was badly rumpled, like he had been sitting in a chair. My guess was that he was either retired or “so important” that it did not matter. Despite his rumpled appearance, he was confident, businesslike, and obviously considered himself in control of the others. So I asked him, “What goes on here?” He said laconically, “We’re trying to get the word out about Communism.” I waited for more. It never came. He paced silently. The younger man came back in the room. My curiosity was growing. I noted him in more detail. He was tall and slender, with a boyish charm about his appearance. He looked rather like a forty-year-old graduate student, with his sandy blond hair combed to the side and hanging a little in his face. He had a prep-school style from the late 1950s or early 1960s. Something about the way he wore his short-sleeved white shirt and baggy khaki pants made me think that he may have been in the military at some point. Then he started to tell me about the file cabinets. He called them “mysterious.” There were six file cabinets in a row, all black, each unit chest high. He apologized for the condition of the files, saying that they were very old and were very disorganized, but he was confident that they had “important information” in them. He started to tell me who the files had belonged to when the older man exploded, cutting him off in mid-sentence in a fit of exasperation. It was starting to get strange. The older man waved him over to the corner of the room. There they argued in tense, hushed tones about whether it was “all right to tell me” who the files belonged to. It was an awkward moment to say the least. I tried to ignore them and acted disinterested. I was uncomfortable with their whispering and did not care to be made part of the family secrets of what was obviously a right-wing propaganda mill. The older man did not want to tell me. The younger man did. The younger man suddenly broke off their discussion and said, “If he is going to work with us, he’s going to find out anyway.” (Actually, the name", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:94:fec44ee357bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3024, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 95, "text": "awkward moment to say the least.

The younger man suddenly broke off their discussion and said, “If he is going to work with us, he’s going to find out anyway.” (Actually, the name was familiar to me, but my memory was vague about the details. I did remember that Garrison considered him a main figure in the anti-Castro operations in New Orleans. I had seen Banister’s name in Garrison’s interview in Playboy, and remembered Nicky Chetta discussing Banister in that memorable session at Jesuit back in 1969. But I was not going to get into all that with these people. They were obviously on the far fringe of the political right, and they were close enough to Banister to have his files! All my instincts told me to steer clear of these people.) The younger man struggled to regain his momentum and explained that the files contained “a lot of very important information,” but there had been a “mysterious indexing system” which had been lost. He baited me with, “Nobody could decipher them,” and offered to let me look to see if I could figure them out. I opened some drawers and inspected the file headings. I had never seen a filing system organized like this before. All the headings were typed numbers like “25- 14.” But without their index, they were completely unintelligible. Someone obviously wanted them that way. (Clerical staff could file and retrieve all day long without ever knowing what was in any given file.) He added, “You’d have to be an Egyptologist to figure it out.” Then I looked at the contents of some of the files. What I saw were newspaper articles published in the late 1950s and early 1960s in New Orleans, Tampa, Miami, and Atlanta. Whoever put this collection together was very systematic, had subscriptions to lots of newspapers, and had adequate manpower to carefully prepare the material for orderly storage and retrieval. Then a wave of fear crashed over me. I realized that I was looking at the remains of an intelligence operation, part of the Cold War against Cuba. And I had two people staring at me, diagnosing every expression, analyzing every word, and evaluating every reaction. I knew I’d better be careful about what I said and did. I stood frozen, staring into the files. My mind raced. I pretended to read some of the articles as I tried to sort out my situation. All I could think about was Jim Garrison. I knew he believed to his core that he had discovered the conspirators in the assassination of President Kennedy.

All I could think about was Jim Garrison. I knew he believed to his core that he had discovered the conspirators in the assassination of President Kennedy. And that he figured Banister was the pivotal man in that group. Who were these people? And how did they get Banister’s files? Garrison had been through the wringer: humiliated and hounded by a belligerent press, embarrassed with a onehour acquittal of his accused conspirator, and harassed by the federal attorneys for years afterwards. Could he possibly be interested in the whole subject of anti-Castro groups in New Orleans thirteen years after the Shaw trial? It was easy to imagine that Garrison might want to forget about the whole tragic event that ended his promising political career. Should I contact Garrison about these files? Then I realized that I’d better start thinking about my situation, not Garrison’s. If I was standing in the viper’s nest, I’d better watch my step. I emerged from my thoughts to say, “Well, it looks like you have got the complete history of Latin American Communism here, at least as reported by the American press.” They were pleased with my comments and began appealing to my interest in Latin American Political Science. The younger man said that these files would be a “great research asset if someone could take the time to go through them and make sense out of them.” I said that I wished I had known about this back when I was in graduate school just a few years before. It would have made a great independent study project. And I was sincere in this lament. I could see the virtually irreplaceable library being offered to me. I would have loved to have studied it. But my life had changed since graduate school. I had moved on to other things, like building my advertising career and raising a family. My time was already over-committed back at Fitzgerald, with none to spare for any non-lucrative academic projects, regardless of how interesting they were. Of course I kept these thoughts to myself. After all, I was on a courtesy call on behalf of Fitzgerald We walked back through the reception area to another office. There I was to meet the “financial backers.” I remember my surprise when I entered the room. The high ceilings were emphasized by long drapes.

The objective of the decor was to look “governmental” and “authoritative.” This was someone’s seat of power. Suddenly, the scene struck me as tragic. It was like grown men playing dress-up. (“Let’s play Oval Office. I’ll be the President. You can be Secretary of State.”) Two men were waiting there, both of whom were of the older man’s generation and dressed in a similar manner. He introduced me to them. Both were doctors. The doctors immediately recognized my name, and said they had known my father as a teacher of orthopedics at Tulane Medical School during the 1950s and 1960s. So I asked them if they taught at Tulane, too. Yes, they had, but it had been twenty years. I inquired about their specialty. Both were radiologists. Trying to continue the conversation in a friendly manner, I said, “So you must have known …,” but I got no further. It was impossible for me not to notice the sudden confusion on the face of the doctor I was talking to. His eyes began darting back and forth between me and the older man, now standing slightly behind me and to my right. Curious about this untimely distraction, I turned my head to the right and saw the older man draw his finger across his throat, signaling the doctor to shut up immediately. More secrets? I had obviously stumbled upon some very sensitive territory, something having to do with doctors these radiologists might have known in the Department of Orthopedics at Tulane Medical School twenty years before. Or to put it bluntly, both of these men knew the mysteriously murdered Dr. Mary Sherman personally. And they were experts in the medical uses of radiation, with access to x-ray machines and radioactive materials. And they were in possession of files belonging to Guy Banister, David Ferrie’s employer and a suspect in the assassination of the President of the United States. And no one, except my boss, knew where I was! I pondered my situation and told myself, “Keep smiling, act relaxed, and don’t mention Mary Sherman.” In 1992, I began working in earnest on this material.

To that end, I read On the Trail of the Assassins, the Jim Garrison book upon which director Oliver Stone based his movie JFK. There I stumbled across a section which had little or nothing to do with Ferrie, but which changed my understanding of what I had seen in New Orleans forever. In this section, Garrison related how he had tried to find Guy Banister’s files in 1966, several years after Banister’s death in September 1964. His investigators sought out Banister’s wife, who told them that upon her husband’s death, his files had been promptly removed from his office, before she got there. She was told they were removed by federal agents.11 For some unknown reason, these federal agents neglected to take the file-indexing system when they removed the file cabinets. Without it, no one could use the files effectively. As luck would have it, the Louisiana State Police also came to her husband’s office shortly after his death and independently confiscated the abandoned file-indexing system. Garrison immediately sent his investigator Lou Ivon to State Police Headquarters in Baton Rouge to search for Banister’s index cards. When Ivon arrived, he discovered that for two years the State Police had been writing messages on the blank side of Banister’s index cards and attaching them to intra-office correspondence. All that remained were a handful of index cards, none of which dealt with any so-called “private investigations.” From these cards Garrison and Ivon reconstructed this partial list of Banister’s files: Note how the subjects listed in the left column could be found in the file numbers shown in the right column. These were identical in form to the numeric filing system I had seen at the radio station ten years before, when they asked me to reconstruct a “mysterious” indexing system which had been lost, and then they argued over whether to tell me that the files belonged to Guy Banister. I was sure they were the same files. Now, I had to do something about it. I started making phone calls and writing letters. First, I tried to contact Garrison, but his publisher told me that he was already in a coma. I told her that I had seen Banister’s files, and that I would be willing to try and locate them, if possible. The problem was that I did not know who had shown them to me, but I had seen them in a small radio station in New Orleans. She passed my story to Jim DiEugenio, the author of Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba, and the Garrison Case, and sent me a copy of his book,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:98:c1ca93212658", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3028, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 99, "text": "was already in a coma.

She passed my story to Jim DiEugenio, the author of Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba, and the Garrison Case, and sent me a copy of his book, which detailed the background of the Garrison investigation. the CIA. Much of the CIA’s Cold War leadership was recruited from Donovan’s New York law firm.) The book went on to explain that Ochsner was President and Founder of an organization called INCA (the Information Council of the Americas) which produced and distributed anti-Communist radio messages to Latin America. This had potential. It had “radio, anti-Communist, Latin America, and doctors” all in one. After several letters and phone calls, DiEugenio brought Gus Russo into the loop. Gus had been a consultant to Oliver Stone’s JFK, and was working on a documentary about Lee Harvey Oswald for the PBS television show Frontline. I gave Gus the same information, and told him what I knew about New Orleans. He was very interested in who had Banister’s files, and we talked a lot. During this string of phone calls, I found an old New Orleans phone book packed away in my Michigan basement. First, I looked up the Maison Blanche Department Store: 901 Canal. Then the Maison Blanche building: 921 Canal. Then INCA. Their address was listed simply as “Audubon Building.” So I looked up the Audubon Building: 931 Canal. I told Gus what I had found. He was headed for New Orleans to do some advance work for the Frontline piece on Oswald, and arranged for me to meet him there to see if we could locate Banister’s files. It was January 1993. We met him in the elevator of his office building and rode to the top floor. The entrance to INCA was a grandiose façade at the end of the hall, reminiscent of large law offices with their thick walnut doors. Upon closer inspection, it became obvious that this was not thick walnut. The façade was made of thin plywood panels nailed to a wooden frame erected in front of the old door. Screw-mounted brass letters from the local hardware store spelled out INCA. But we did not enter through this august entrance. Butler took us to a side door on the north side of the hall. There we entered a small functional office. A Frank Sinatra-era microphone sat on his desk like a paper weight. Audio and video tapes were neatly organized on the shelves. We sat down and exchanged business cards. He looked at Gus Russo’s Frontline card, then at mine. This brought Butler to life.

A Frank Sinatra-era microphone sat on his desk like a paper weight. Audio and video tapes were neatly organized on the shelves. We sat down and exchanged business cards. He looked at Gus Russo’s Frontline card, then at mine. This brought Butler to life. He started banging on the desk with his fist, calling Oswald one of the “world’s great revolutionaries,” the “first New Leftist,” the “first hippie,” the “spearhead of world revolution” who set in motion a chain of events that led to the collapse of the Iron Curtain. He even called Oswald an “avatar,” a Hindu word for a deity who becomes a human to accomplish some divine purpose. In the middle of his Oswald theories, he took time to criticize the Warren Commission critics for grasping at straws, and ridiculed all the reports connecting Oswald to Banister as meaningless speculation. Gus and I listened. Then Butler proudly told us how, immediately after the assassination, he carried a reel-to-reel tape player over to Congressman Hale Boggs’s office and played the tape of his radio debate with Oswald, so that Boggs could hear Oswald say, “I am a Marxist.” As Butler told it, upon hearing the recording, Boggs called Lyndon Johnson to tell him he had just heard evidence that Oswald was a Communist. If this story is true, it means that President Johnson knew Boggs’ position on Oswald before appointing him to the Warren Commission. Is this prejudicial? Or manipulative? Think how hard it would be for a Congressman to change his position on a subject of this magnitude after he had staked it out with the President of the United States.12 As Butler talked, I studied him closely. His tweed jacket and cardigan sweater. His ivy-league haircut parted to the side, hanging slightly in his face. Was this the same man who showed me Banister’s files ten years before? He looked about fifty years old now. Ten years before he would have been forty. This was likely the same man, but I could not be absolutely sure. Gus and I kept at him in the hall to keep him talking, hoping that something else would happen. Finally, in a surprise gesture, he offered to show us inside INCA. First, he took us to a room across the hall to find a record album that INCA had produced on the radio debate with Lee Harvey Oswald. It was called Oswald: Self-portrait in Red. Butler gave On the front of the album was a drawing of Oswald depicting him as an angry young revolutionary.

On the back of the album the headline at the top read, “I am a Marxist,” with a signature line from Lee Harvey Oswald, dated August 21, 1963. Below were three photographs: Hale Boggs, Dr. Alton Ochsner and Ed Butler. Beneath the photo of Ochsner it said, he was “perhaps the only listener who knew of Oswald’s defection before the debate” [my emphasis]. Butler gave us a quick walking tour. The place was a mess. Every conceivable space was stacked with dust-covered boxes. It had obviously not been anything but a storage area for years, but it did make me wonder who had been paying the rent for all those years. The desk with the eagle on the front was there. The high ceilings were there. The American flag was there. The expensive wooden desk was not. And the rooms seemed smaller than I remembered. Then we saw a bank of black file cabinets. Butler continued his narration about his study of revolutions around the world, gesturing toward the file cabinets as he talked. Gus was about to climb out of his shoes. Butler opened a file cabinet. The files had obviously been worked over. The hanging files were gone. All that was left were manila file folders with hand-written names on their tabs. Butler commented that they had gotten some volunteers to update the files. He flashed some articles in front of us. Some had the aged, yellow look of thirty-year-old newspaper clippings. Others were more recently photocopied on clean white paper. Were these the remains of Banister’s files? And if so, what did this mean? Gus and I walked back to his hotel just a few blocks away. There he started pressing me: Was that the same man? Were those the same files? I realized that my answer might be used to implicate someone in a conspiracy to assassinate the President. The scale of the accusation confounded me. I wanted to make sure my answer was right. I told Gus Russo that I had to check out one more bit of information before I said anything definitive. The next morning I stopped by to see Ron Thompson, President of Fitzgerald Advertising, Inc., the man who had sent me on the courtesy call ten years before. I told him I was in town working on a Frontline documentary about Oswald and that we had just interviewed a man named Ed Butler.

I asked him directly if Ed Butler was the man he had sent me to see ten years before. Ron said, “Yes,” adding that he had been a childhood friend of Butler’s brother.13 The brother had called and asked him, as a favor, to take a look at the operation. “They were doing some Voice of America-type work,” Ron added. “I don’t think they were involved in anything illegal.” Since I never told Ron Thompson anything about the files, either in 1982 or in 1993, my assumption is that no one at Fitzgerald was ever aware that Butler had them. Later that morning Gus and I went to see Boatner Reily, President of the Reily Coffee Company. Russo wanted to talk to him about Oswald, and I tagged along because I was still looking for the older man I had met at INCA. Reily received us promptly despite the surprise visit. We talked to the tall, slender, athletic Reily for about fifteen minutes. He was charming and sophisticated, which is not surprising, considering he was Chairman of the Board of Tulane University for twelve years. He was definitely not the older man I saw at INCA. He did, however, acknowledge that his uncle had contributed financially to Ochsner’s political activities, and he asked us how he might get his company’s employment records of Oswald back from the FBI. 1 The purchase of the United Fruit land has always been presented in the U.S. media as socialists nationalizing foreign owned assets. To the contrary, the Guatemalan government paid United Fruit exactly what the company had declared the value of the land to be for tax purposes. This was a case of eminent domain, not nationalization. United Fruit felt “cheated” because they had deliberately under-valued the undeveloped land to avoid paying taxes on it. 2 The 1954 coup d’etat in Guatemala was engineered by CIA officer Howard Hunt, who later master-minded the Watergate burglary. It has always amused me to read that John McCloy (Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, architect of the Japanese internment program, target selector for the World War II bombing of German cities, and member of the Warren Commission) said, “The Warren Commission must show the American people that we are not a banana republic.” The Dulles brothers’ stock position in United Fruit is discussed by Hinckle and Turner, Deadly Secrets, p. 40. 3 It has been reported that the Ochsner Medical Center treated wounded Contra soldiers for free (Carpenter, “Social Origins,” p. 163) as part of a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:102:f56cf058b32c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3032, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "the Japanese internment program, target selector for the World War II bombing of German cities, and member of the Warren Commission) said, “The Warren Commission must show the American people that we are not a banana republic.” The Dulles brothers’ stock position in United Fruit is discussed by Hinckle and Turner, Deadly Secrets, p. 40. 3 It has been reported that the Ochsner Medical Center treated wounded Contra soldiers for free (Carpenter, “Social Origins,” p. 163) as part of a commitment to fight Communism in Latin America, but that should not be confused with Freckles’ comment, which referred to a deliberate attempt to develop a biological weapon to assassinate a foreign head of state. 4 DiEugenio, Destiny Betrayed, p. 38. Numerous other references in JFK assassination literature point to the FBI’s Chicago office. For example, in Deadly Secrets Hinckle and Turner discussed Robert Maheu (p. 31-32) and William Harvey (p. 136-137), both of whom worked there before joining the CIA. Maheu was the CIA’s contact with the Mafia, and later joined Howard Hughes’ organization. Harvey headed the CIA’s assassination squad. Guy Banister headed that same Chicago FBI office. 12 Hale Boggs was House Majority Whip, the third most powerful member of that chamber, and helped pass LBJ’s Great Society budget. One of two U.S. Representatives appointed to the six-man Warren Commission, he was one of the only members of the Commission to raise substantive questions during their sessions. When the theory was proposed that the bullet which entered Kennedy’s back exited through his throat and then hit Connally, Boggs asked about the earlier medical reports which said that bullet path only went a few inches into Kennedy’s back. Years later, Boggs is said to have expressed his doubts about the Commission’s conclusions. He became Majority Leader in 1971. In October of 1972, as he campaigned for a colleague, his plane and the entire entourage disappeared over the Gulf of Alaska; no trace of it was ever found. People tend to respect both medical reputationsand financial success. Dr. Alton Ochsner had plenty of the American Cancer Society, President of the American College of Surgeons, President of the International Society of Surgeons, the Chairman of the Section on Surgery for the American Medical Association, and President of the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, one of the largest medical centers in America, with annual revenues approaching $300, 000, 000 per year. As a recognition of his contributions, he received the Distinguished Service Award of the American Medical Association in 1967, and he also received honorary awards from Ireland, England, Greece, Spain, Nicaragua, Columbia, Honduras, Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela, and Japan.1 As all could see, he was a highly respected man of medicine, clearly above suspicion as it is commonly known.

But there was another side of Alton Ochsner which the public did not see as clearly. He used his position and contacts to advance his right-wing political philosophy, and in the process developed a long complex relationship with powerful political figures and agencies of the U.S. government. Ochsner was born in Kimball, South Dakota, in 1896,2 towards the end of the era of sod houses and Indian massacres. The only son with five older sisters, Alton grew up the product of his German ancestry, and became what might be called an over-achiever. He attended the University of South Dakota and did his medical training at Washington University in St. Louis. His advanced medical training and many of the pivotal moves in his career were arranged by his uncle A.J. Ochsner, a famous surgeon who was chief of surgery at two hospitals in Chicago. A.J. Ochsner’s influence cast a long shadow. He was founder and later president of the American College of Surgeons, as well as head of surgery at the University of Illinois Medical School. His international contacts were considerable. A.J. saw to it that Alton trained under the leading surgeons of the day. A.J. Ochsner’s best friend was William J. Mayo, founder of the famous Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and when it was time for Alton Ochsner to start his own clinic, the Mayo Clinic was used as a model.3 In 1921, Alton Ochsner headed to Chicago to train at his uncle’s elbow. He fainted at his first sight of surgery, and at his second, and at his third. His uncle told him to get a grip if he wanted to be a surgeon. He did. A.J. worked Alton hard and taught him his own set of medical standards, like “Don’t operate on anybody who is not going to get well.” Anxious to begin surgery of his own, Alton practiced by performing surgical procedures on dogs in an outbuilding on the grounds of his uncle’s hospital.4 Then in 1922, again thanks to his uncle’s influence, Alton Ochsner headed to Europe for a two-year residency in Switzerland and Germany. The first big medical success of his career was bringing blood transfusions to Europe. Or should we say “back to Europe.” Early attempts at blood transfusions had failed miserably. It was not until an Austrian physician named Karl Landsteiner developed techniques for blood typing that blood transfusions became safe. Landsteiner’s original work had been ignored in Europe, so he came to the U.S. in 1912, and introduced the technique at A.J. Ochsner’s hospital in Chicago.5 Alton", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:104:343d95d4968d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3034, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "in Switzerland and Germany.

Ochsner’s hospital in Chicago.5 Alton Ochsner learned to type blood while working in his uncle’s laboratory. His uncle provided him with blood transfusion equipment to take with him to Europe. There, Swiss doctors refused to perform blood transfusions because of the terrible results of earlier attempts. They were skeptical of young Ochsner’s claim that the techniques which he had been taught in Chicago were safe. They first let him attempt a transfusion on what they considered to be an expendable patient, a criminal who had been shot by the police. If he died, it was no great loss to society. He survived. Several days later the president of a Swiss bank entered the hospital suffering from heavy blood loss due to a ruptured ulcer. The Swiss doctors were unable to help the banker and feared the embarrassment of such a prominent person dying in their hospital. They asked Ochsner to do what he could. When the banker pulled through, Ochsner was proclaimed the blood transfusion expert of Europe. He lit up the European scene with his first medical article, telling of the magic of blood transfusions. It was written in German. He was an American medical celebrity in Europe at the age of twenty-seven.6 A.J. was pleased. Chicago. Soon they departed on a kind of victory tour, visiting first European and then American medical clinics for several months. In Europe he got his first exposure to politics and witnessed epidemic inflation first hand. When he arrived, the exchange rate in Germany was four marks to the dollar; when he left, the rate was four million marks to the dollar. In 1924, at the age of twenty-eight, he returned to the United States. Educated, trained, traveled, and connected, he was prepared to take full advantage of the dawning of the golden age of medicine.7 Before long, he landed a full-time teaching position at the nearby University of Wisconsin. His stay was brief. The hand of his uncle’s influence can be seen again, when, in 1927, at the age of thirty-one and after just one year of teaching at the University of Wisconsin, Alton Ochsner was appointed Head of Surgery at Tulane Medical School, replacing Dr. Robert Matas, an internationally-known surgeon who had headed Tulane’s surgery department for years. During Ochsner’s get-acquainted visit, Matas invited him to witness a spectacular display of the older physician’s own surgical skill.

During Ochsner’s get-acquainted visit, Matas invited him to witness a spectacular display of the older physician’s own surgical skill. Even if Ochsner did not accept the position, at least he could return home with a great story about Matas. In Ochsner’s presence, Matas removed a 92-pound tumor from a 182-pound patient. The tumor was so large that it had to be impaled with ice tongs and lifted with a block-and-tackle pulley system bolted to the ceiling of the operating room. The remaining 90 pounds of patient died the next day from lack of blood. The technology of blood transfusions had not yet made it to New Orleans.8 The appointment of a young outsider over the heads of several well-qualified, older doctors, who were waiting in the wings to get the position, raised eyebrows and set in motion a camp of anti-Ochsner sentiment in the medical community which followed Alton throughout his career. But Ochsner’s success in New Orleans was so complete that this has been dismissed as jealousy. ment of an unqualified upstart. Actually Dr. Vidrine, whom Long appointed as Superintendent of Charity Hospital, was both a graduate of Tulane Medical School and a Rhodes Scholar. Both men were young. Vidrine was twenty-eight, and Ochsner was thirty-one. And both had their own agendas for improving the hospital and advancing their careers. Vidrine had the support of the governor and was winning. Ochsner was ready to bail out of New Orleans, and wrote a letter describing his bitterness to a friend. The letter, which Ochsner claimed he never mailed, was lost in the halls of Charity Hospital and wound up in the hands of Huey Long himself. Long, who was battling with Tulane for other reasons, used it as an excuse to throw Tulane Medical School, and Ochsner personally, out of the Charity Hospital. The incident gave Ochsner public notoriety and credibility with the elements of Louisiana which opposed Huey Long’s populist agenda, which was just about everybody with money. This facilitated Ochsner’s successful penetration of the elite social circles of New Orleans. During the 1930s and 1940s, Ochsner’s skill as a laboratory researcher grew. Clever and solution-oriented, he prided himself in developing practical medical innovations. As researchers go, Ochsner was a pragmatist, “the type of researcher who wasted no time in the laboratory.”9 He was fascinated by “the idea of serendipity,” which is defined as “a gift for discovering valuable or agreeable things by accident,”10 and it influenced his research.

As a result of his research activities, he joined the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, and became an officer in its southern chapter. His biographers flirted with the idea that Ochsner might have even received a Nobel Prize, if he had been able to devote more time to his research efforts, but there is no evidence that the Nobel committee ever considered him for such. However, if Ochsner should have received a prize for any of his medical work, his crusade against cigarette smoking would be my candidate. In 1936 he made a serendipitous observation, and became one of the first people to conclude that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer. Noting that lung cancer was virtually non-existent in non-smokers, and that incidences of lung cancer increased with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, he constructed a case that he took to the American Cancer Society. Here we see one of Ochsner’s strengths at work: The clarity and certainty with which he saw medicine was comforting to everyone around him. And he was always willing to take action if he thought he could accomplish something positive. In Ochsner’s words: “Of course, everybody thought Ochsner went on to become President of the American Cancer Society in 1949 and sat on their Board of Directors with fellow elected-officer William “Wild Bill” Donovan, the celebrated founder and head of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (covert warfare and intelligence during World War II, and predecessor to the CIA).11 As a medical school professor, Ochsner was notorious for his demagogic tactics, the best known of which was “the bullpen.” Here, in an amphitheater full of hundreds of medical students, Ochsner conducted an intimidating hybrid of quiz-show and psychodrama, screaming questions at medical students and berating them over their answers. He justified these tactics by saying medicine was stressful. Diagnosis was a matter of common sense,12 and medical students had to be taught to think under pressure. Many students were humiliated by the experience. One even fainted. When his own son was in the bullpen, Ochsner grabbed him by both lapels, shook him in front of his classmates, and yelled, “You’re not going to treat it any different than I would treat it.”13 Ochsner carried his philosophy of harsh discipline back into his home. To quote one of his sons: “My father used to beat the hell out of me.” Once he even broke a leather belt during a beating.

To quote one of his sons: “My father used to beat the hell out of me.” Once he even broke a leather belt during a beating. To quote his official biographers: “In a more tolerant time it might have been considered abuse.” But Ochsner was proud to be considered “the fastest belt in New Orleans.” 14 During an interview late in his life, Ochsner blamed all of the permissiveness of modern society (all of the drugs, political unrest and promiscuity of the 1960s and 1970s, even abortion) on the ill-conceived advice of Dr. Benjamin Spock, who suggested that physical punishment and negative reinforcement were not effective means of parenting. In Ochsner’s words: “…everything has to be disciplined. Even a dog has to be disciplined. A cat has to be disciplined…. You show me an undisciplined person, and I’ll show you an insecure person and an unhappy person…. We now have a whole generation of insecure, unhappy persons because they don’t know what discipline is, and it’s a direct result of the advice of Dr. Spock.” 15 In the area of medical ethics, he was more forgiving, and conditionally embraced the concept of euthanasia: “I see no reason for keeping a person alive who otherwise has no chance of recovery.”16 Further: “I think there’s nothing worse than to see a person who is a vegetable, who has no chance of ever being better…. If I were in that position, I would want someone to put me out…. And, of course, the horrible thing about such situations is the tremendous cost of prolonging such cases.”17 The backbone of Ochsner’s medical reputation was his technical mastery in the operating room. He claimed 20,000 operations to his credit during his fifty-year career. Yet he was not perfect. At one point, he openly acknowledged that he had accidently killed an unidentified patient by clamping off the artery to his lungs.18 The most legendary of his surgical feats was the successful separation of Siamese twins.19 The most dramatic of his operating room innovations was the use of a blowtorch on a patient during a radical mastectomy.20 School and organized a multidisciplinary clinic. Other New Orleans doctors feared the encroachment of a bigbusiness approach to medicine, protested the establishment of the multi-disciplinary clinic which would compete with independent physicians, and appealed to the AMA to stop it.

Later it moved to a d commissioned military base in Jefferso The Latin American angle was a natural for a medical clinic in New Orleans. And as we noted earlier, New Orleans was America’s commercial pipeline to Latin America, and Tulane’s reputation was golden in the region. For a group of Tulane doctors to form a medical clinic to serve the needs of the Latin elite was great news for those who could step on a plane in their capital city and be in New Orleans quicker than most Americans. To promote his clinic, Ochsner made over a hundred trips to Latin America during his career, and became friends with its rulers. One event that helped jump-start his acceptance in these elite Latin circles was a phone call to Ochsner from Cordell Hull, the U.S. Secretary of State during World War II. Hull called Ochsner and asked him to take care of Tomas Gabriel Duque, the former President (and dictator) of Panama, who had helped U.S. intelligence organize a coup d’etat against pro-Nazi elements during World War II.23 Connections within these circles grew. Before it was over, Ochsner was the President of the Cordell Hull Foundation.24 It is hard to find information on the Cordell Hull Foundation, but those who spoke to me about it said it was politically very active, sponsoring Latin American students in American universities, and giving scholarships to children of State Department employees. Tulane Medical School to investigate an exchange program between Tulane and the Nicaraguan government, a largerthan-life painting of Alton Ochsner was hung in the medical school for the occasion.26 And Ochsner and Somoza shared mutual anti-Communist objectives. Somoza’s personal physician, Dr. Henri DeBayle, sat on the Board of Directors of Guy Banister’s infamous Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean.27 Another patient was Juan Peron, the President (and dictator) of Argentina. Ochsner flew to Buenos Aires to treat Peron for a problem in one of his legs. Peron complimented Ochsner, saying that surgeons were “men of action.”28 Peron was on the mark. Ochsner prided himself in his action orientation, saying: “Once you know what needs to be done, there is no point waiting.” Following the lead of these dictators came the oligarchies of Latin American countries which had not developed their own health care systems. By the 1980s over 10,000 patients per year were coming from Latin America to the Ochsner Clinic for treatment.

Alton Ochsner and gave him a Cadillac as a “thank you” present, but he also donated $750, 000 to the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation as seed money for Ochsner’s new hospital. Meanwhile, Murchison purchased 30,000 acres of Louisiana swamp land and prepared it for a real estate development now known as New Orleans East, which covers about one-third of the land in the city of New Orleans.29 I have always heard that Murchison bought it from Lady Bird Johnson. When LBJ announced the construction of Interstate 10 through the middle of this newly drained tract of land, plus the construction of NASA’s largest facility on the same site, property values rose as fast as any in American history. Murchison made a fortune. Dave Treen’s successful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives and Lt. Governor Jimmy Fitzmorris’ unsuccessful bid for Governor. Ochsner was always very close to Congressman F. Edward Hebert, with whom he shared an ultra-right, hard-line, anti-Communist sentiment. On the other hand, Ochsner had an offand-on friendship with liberal Congressman Hale Boggs, whose photo appeared alongside One of Ochsner’s disputes with Boggs was the claim that in 1957 Boggs had assisted Ochsner in getting the multi-million dollar Hill-Burton grant from the U.S. government to build his hospital. Ochsner claimed Boggs’ influence was negligible.30 Considering that Boggs was one of the most powerful people in the U.S. House of Representatives at the time, Ochsner must have had some pretty serious connections to think that Boggs’ influence was negligible. Despite all his posturing as a conservative, Ochsner was called “the most aggressive seeker and recipient of so-called federal handouts in the Second District” (Boggs’ district) by a Louisiana State Representative.31 It is interesting to note the comments of Admiral Stansfield Turner, who testified to Congress as the Director of the CIA about the extent of the CIA’s domestic activities. One of the Congressional questions was whether the CIA conducted its own medical research here inside the United States, and if so, how were they funding it? Turner said that the CIA had funded 159 medical facilities around the country for the purpose of conducting covert medical research. The funding was done in conjunction with Congress’ Hill-Burton Fund. The CIA supplied seed money through blind third parties, and then the facility received matching funds as a Hill-Burton grant. When the facility was completed, the agency had access to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:110:ef68cc3ad6a3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3040, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 111, "text": "CIA conducted its own medical research here inside the United States, and if so, how were they funding it?

When the facility was completed, the agency had access to a portion of the hospital’s bed space for its purposes.32 It has been suggested to me that the Murchison donation might have been the seed money for the project, and that Congressman Hebert’s influence on the CIA budget may have been the real force that provided the Hill-Burton funding. It is probable that Ochsner’s hospital was one of the 159 covert research centers which the CIA has admitted to setting up. The FBI maintained a file on Dr. Alton Ochsner which we now have access to through the Freedom of Information Act. It shows his long relationship with the U.S. military, the FBI and other U.S. government agencies.33 These records show that in 1941 Ochsner received an “excepted appointment” from the Civil Service Commission, and in 1946 he received a citation from the U.S. War Department recognizing the medical research he did for the government.34 In 1955 he became a consultant to the U.S. Army, and in 1957 he became a consultant to the U.S. Air Force. Later, in 1957, the FBI cleared Ochsner for a “Sensitive Position” for the U.S. government, and J. Edgar Hoover personally approved him as an official contact for the Special Agent in Charge of the New Orleans FBI office, for whom Ochsner had already been performing discreet surgery at discounted rates. In October of 1959, after two years of working in a “Sensitive Position,” presumably with the FBI, the FBI conducted yet another “Sensitive Position” investigation on Ochsner and forwarded their findings to an unnamed U.S. government agency. Several days later, on October 21, 1959, the FBI formally discontinued Ochsner’s relationship with the FBI, freeing him up to accept an assignment from the other undisclosed agency. So what was happening in 1957 and 1959? What was this other agency? Why would they have needed the services of a doctor? And what did they need from this doctor that they could not get from the legions of other doctors already working for the U.S. government in one capacity or another? These are important questions. By the late 1950s Alton Ochsner was at the pinnacle of his prestige. His clinic had grown enormously and was at its third location.

He had been King of Carnival and had won numerous civic awards.35 In 1956 he stepped down as Tulane’s Chief of Surgery, and in 1961 Tulane’s Board of Directors terminated his teaching position, citing a conflict of interest with his clinic as the reason. If nothing else, it helped distance Tulane from Ochsner’s increasingly covert activities. He was sixty-five years old at the time. Having achieved considerable financial success during his career, the Tulane termination meant that Ochsner was now free to devote himself to his personal passion: politics. Basically, Ochsner was an arch-conservative with an antebellum, anti-welfare mentality. A quick glimpse of his political philosophy can be seen in the following quote from a letter he wrote in the early ′60s to U.S. Senator Allen Ellender: “I sincerely hope that the Civil Rights Bill can also be defeated, because if it were passed, it would certainly mean virtual dictatorship by the President and the Attorney General, a thing I cades. Trade was New Orleans’ biggest business, and seventy-five percent of it was with Latin America.37 The entire New Orleans business community was threatened by this revolutionary trend. The reactionary sentiment in New Orleans centered around civic organizations which promoted trade with Latin America, like International House and the International Trade Mart. Ochsner himself was President of International House,38 and he joined International Trade Mart’s Clay Shaw on the Board of Directors of the Foreign Policy Association of New Orleans, which brought CIA Deputy Director Charles Cabell to New Orleans to discuss the Communist threat, a small favor for Congressman Hebert’s district. Ochsner saw the situation clearly. With revolutionaries in the capitals of Latin America, the displaced elite would no longer be able to jump on jets and fly to New Orleans for medical treatment. The medical empire he built was threatened. Ochsner did something about it. He became a fanatical anti-Communist. In 1961, Ochsner institutionalized his anti-Communist crusade by founding an organization called INCA, the Information Council of the Americas. INCA’s objective was to prevent Communist revolutions in Latin America by teaching the sordid truth about Communism to the Latin American masses. In brief, it was a right-wing propaganda mill, loosely modeled on Radio Free Europe. Ochsner served both as INCA’s President and Chairman. A typical INCA production interviewed Cuban exiles about the horrors of losing their sugar plantations or their mattress factories to Castro’s forces.

A typical INCA production interviewed Cuban exiles about the horrors of losing their sugar plantations or their mattress factories to Castro’s forces. From these interviews, INCA produced and distributed tape recordings called “Truth Tapes” to 120 radio stations throughout Latin America. INCA’s most ambitious project was a film about Castro called Hitler in Havana. The New York Times reviewed the film, calling it “the crudest form of propaganda” and a “tasteless affront to minimum journalistic standards.”39 In a perceptive article about INCA, archivist Arthur Carpenter described anti-Communism as an ideology of convenience, which offered the ruling elite “a respectable way to discredit challenges to its power.”40 But Ochsner’s conviction was deeper than that. Once I had the opportunity to ask someone who knew him personally about his political views, and got this reply: “He was like a fundamentalist preacher in the sense that the fight against Communism was the only subject that he would talk about, or even allow you to talk about, in his presence.” Financing for INCA is said to have come from Ochsner personally and from other doctors and business people in the New Orleans area. Ochsner and INCA Executive Director Ed Butler enlisted as many New Orleans business and political leaders as possible in their cause. Sears heirs Edgar and Edith Stern, owners of WDSU radio and television, were members of INCA.41 Eustis Reily of the Reily Coffee Company personally donated thousands of dollars to INCA.42 Of all the names on the INCA letterhead, the most interesting one is INCA’s “Chief of Security,” Robert R. Rainold, who was described as the “Past President of the National Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI.” One must wonder if Mr. Rainold was aware that the former head of the FBI’s Chicago office lived in New Orleans or that the Reily Coffee Company was managed by an ex-FBI man. In the spring of 1963, Ochsner was quoted in a newspaper as saying, “As a surgeon, I know that in an emergency, sometimes you are forced to do things quickly or the patient will die … We must spread the warning of the creeping sickness of Communism faster to Latin Americans, and to our own people, or Central and South America will be exposed to the Later that summer INCA members descended upon Lee Harvey Oswald, filming his pro-Castro leafleting for television and ambushing him during a live radio broadcast with a newspaper clipping about his “defection” to the Soviet Union.

The records of the Mexican consulate office in New Orleans show that when Oswald obtained his visa for his trip to Mexico, his name followed William Gaudet, who is known to have worked for the CIA and who edited an anti-Communist newsletter which Ochsner financed.44 There is no doubt that INCA produced anti-Communist propaganda for Latin America, but one has to wonder what other activities it was involved in? Mary Sherman’s murder happened the following summer, in July 1964. There is no mention of her in Ochsner’s biography, nor of the grief or shock Ochsner must have personally felt over her tragic death. On July 22, 1964, however, the day after Mary Sherman’s murder, Ochsner wrote a letter to his largest financial contributor saying “our Government, our schools, our press, and our churches have become infiltrated with Communism.”45 It appears the Communists must have forgotten to infiltrate “our hospitals.” Ochsner’s own biographers cautioned that once Ochsner got out of his field of medical expertise, he exhibited an amazing naiveté, and even said things that could be termed as “ridiculous.”46 The problem seemed to be that he saw the rest of the world with the same clarity that he saw medicine. For example, he cited the lack of anti-war demonstrations on college campuses during the 1970-71 school year to be the result of INCA’s influence.47 In fact, this was linked to the cynical and movement-deflating initiation of a lottery system for draft eligibility, which would quickly reduce the number of college males facing potential induction by over seventyfive percent. But none of Ochsner’s monomania hindered his ability to rub elbows in increasingly powerful and wealthy circles. During one visit to Central America as a guest of the Guatemalan government, he became friends with National Airline’s Chairman Dudley Swim of Carmel, California. Swim offered Ochsner a seat on National’s Board of Directors.48 There he became friends with National’s largest stockholder, washing-machine baron Bud Maytag. Ochsner also sat on the Board of Directors of National Banks of Florida, courtesy of Edward W. Ball who managed the Alfred duPont Fund.49 It was in these circles that Ochsner met William Frawley, an arch-conservative California industrialist, who headed Schick Electric and Technicolor. Frawley became INCA’s largest financial contributor, and put Ochsner on his Board of Directors. Among Frawley’s political friends was Richard Nixon, whom Frawley had helped in his early political career. In the early 1960s, ex-Vice President Richard Nixon called on Ochsner in New Orleans, supposedly to discuss his future political plans.

In the early 1960s, ex-Vice President Richard Nixon called on Ochsner in New Orleans, supposedly to discuss his future political plans. Nixon joined Ochsner and newspaper editor George Healy for a private luncheon at the exclusive Boston Club across the street from Ochsner’s INCA.50 While Nixon and Ochsner shared many political sentiments, they also shared some important medical experiences. The ill-fated polio vaccine which NIH released during Nixon’s Vice Presidency (1953-61) killed one of Ochsner’s grandsons and temporarily crippled his granddaughter. The publicity about the bad vaccine outraged the public and caused a political debacle, toppling the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and routing the leadership of NIH. Entering the office of President in 1969, Nixon promptly declared “War on Cancer,” quadrupled the budget of the National Cancer Institute,51 converted the Army’s biological warfare center to a cancer research laboratory, and financed NIH’s “Viral Cancer Program.”52 Were these events somehow connected? Had Nixon discussed any of his plans for his War on Cancer with the former president of the American Cancer Society? Ochsner’s second wife, whom he met at a party at Frawley’s house, was even closer to Nixon than Ochsner was. Her first husband, an attorney from Los Angeles, was one of the people who helped launch Nixon’s political career.53 When problems with her passport threatened to interfere with Mrs. Ochsner’s honeymoon to Greece, she called the White House and asked to speak to “Dick” Nixon. Her problems with the State Department were promptly solved.54 This is the level of political support that Alton Ochsner enjoyed when District Attorney Jim Garrison began his investigation into the murder of JFK. And when Garrison started looking into the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald, he discovered that INCA and Ochsner were close to those events. Garrison’s original intention was to arrest “the whole gang down at INCA” and squeeze them until they talked. His staff, however, felt that strategy was too risky and might backfire.55 Garrison compromised and arrested only Clay Shaw, in the hope that Shaw’s association with Oswald would be more tangible and could be proved more easily in a court of law. One has to wonder if Garrison was aware that Ochsner had been working in a “Sensitive Position” for the U.S. government. In May 1967, as Garrison turned up the heat in his JFK investigation in New Orleans, Ochsner feared his own arrest.56 In response, INCA’s corporate records were air expressed to California, where Ed Butler put them “under lock and key.”57 Butler was in California working for one of Frawley’s companies.58 Frawley had contributed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:115:9d832322cb59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3045, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "easily in a court of law.

Needless to say, Ochsner did not take Garrison’s investigation lying down. He fought back in his own inimitable manner. First, he was very vocal about his opinion that Garrison’s probe was unpatriotic because it eroded public confidence and threatened the stability of the American government. (How could arresting the President’s assassins threaten the stability of the American government?) Secondly, Ochsner promoted the idea that Garrison was crazy. He even managed to get a copy of Garrison’s military medical records. These showed that Garrison, a frontline pilot, who flew behind enemy lines during the World War II invasion of Europe, had suffered from battle fatigue, was grounded temporarily due to mental exhaustion, and had received psychological counseling. As tenuous as it was, this could be used to assert that Garrison had some form of psychological problem at some point in his life. It was all part of the “he-must-be-crazy” tactic. Ochsner sent the file to a friend who was the publisher of the Nashville Banner. 59 But that was mild compared to what came next. Garrison was being assisted by New York attorney Mark Lane, who had written Rush to Judgement, the first book to question the conclusions of the Warren Commission. To discredit Garrison, Ochsner attacked Lane, branding him an unscrupulous Communist and “a professional propagandist of the lunatic left,” who was trying to create distrust and cause the U.S. to “crumble from within.”60 Further, Ochsner instructed Congressman F. Edward Hebert (Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee) to tell Congressman Edwin E. Willis (Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities) to dig up “whatever information you can” on Mark Lane. Hebert sent Ochsner a report on Lane extracted from the confidential government files, which cited various “Communist fronts” with which Lane had been associated.61 Ochsner also secured a questionable second report on Lane from an unknown source. The unsigned cover memo said its information was from “the files of the New York City Police, the FBI, and other security agencies,” and claimed that Lane was “a sadist and masochist, charged on numerous occasions with sodomy.” Armed with these materials and a photo of a man (supposed to be Lane) engaged in a sadomasochistic act with a prostitute, Ochsner personally campaigned against Lane and the District Attorney.62", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:116:ee9f8e4ecdd5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3046, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "secured a questionable second report on Lane from an unknown source.

Therefore, I assume that the photo does or did exist, but I have always assumed that it was a fake. None of these “dirty tricks” should in any way be considered a true reflection of Mark Lane’s character. 63 Comments personally heard by the author in New Orleans from the 1960s to the 1990s. n the Playboy interview we reviewed earlier, Jim Garrison referred to a “medical treatise” written by David IFerrie on the subject of inducing cancer virally.1 Finding this document was a high priority for me, since it would go a long way towards verifying Garrison’s claim about Ferrie’s cancer research and establishing Ferrie’s capability to induce cancer. The other side of the issue: What did the American medical establishment really know about cancer at the time? And how did the theories and techniques in “David Ferrie’s medical treatise” relate to that leading edge of cancer research in America? For over a year I asked many people if they knew anything about the treatise and got nowhere. I had begun to question whether it even existed. Then I got a phone call from Jim DiEugenio, the author of Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba, and the Garrison Case, and chairman of a group of published JFK assassination authorities called Citizens for Truth about the Kennedy Assassination (CTKA), saying that one of the researchers pouring through the recently released JFK assassination materials in Washington, D.C. had found it.

Hence, Cowdry’s “final common path” seems at work. Thus the term “carcinogen” has reservations. It is to be noted that methylcholanthrene failed to give a 100% result. Of course it could be argued that there may have been a conflict since two other items were used in the carcinogenesis. 1) The following is the process for manufacturing (magnesium tracinate): 2) Obtain Bacillus Subtilis, Tracy I and grow over high protein agar. 3) Catch up the culture in solution and heat at 56 degrees C for an hour. 4) Filter with a number 11 Berkfold filter for a cell-free filtrate. 5) Combine 100cc of the filtrate with 100cc of Magnesium Sulphate. 6) Place in electrophoresis for recovery. 7) Wash out the magnesium hydroxide. 8) Catch up the crystals in normal saline. 1500 mg to 50cc saline.

The most obvious one is that the author had daily access to x-ray machines and other professional laboratory supplies and equipment. Consider these sentences collected from disparate parts of the treatise: David Ferrie would not have had access to an unreleased antibiotic developed by a top medical researcher.2 It is clear that this document was written by a professional cancer researcher working in a well-equipped medical laboratory at the highest levels of American medicine. Minimally, someone on Mary Sherman’s level. Perhaps someone even higher in the national research network. Garrison made the assumption that finding a typewritten document in Ferrie’s apartment alongside his caged mice meant that Ferrie had written it. It appears that he was wrong in that assumption. But proving Garrison wrong on this detail gives us little relief. What made Ferrie dangerous was the combination of his capabilities and his motives, not his originality. It would have been far better for the world if Ferrie had written this document based on his original theories and his home-brewed experiments. Knowing that he had access to When was the document written? It was not written before 1955, since it quotes articles published that year. Any review of a fast-changing field like medicine would normally concentrate on the most recent articles published on the subject. Since the last date on the bibliography is 1955, it is reasonable to conclude that this document was written shortly thereafter, in late-1955, 1956, or 1957. The timeframe ends in 1957, because that year two researchers from the National Institute of Health announced a major discovery about viral cancer. Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy discovered a virus which caused multiple cancer tumors in a variety of small mammals. It was the first time one virus caused cancer in several different species. They named their virus “polyoma.” This was a watershed event in cancer research, and it shifted the focus of cancer research toward viruses. It is highly unlikely that a treatise on viral cancer would have been written following the announcement of Stewart and Eddy’s research without referring to it in the bibliography. Therefore, this treatise appears to have been written in 1956. For whom was this treatise written? It was an internal document for a large organization which was heavily involved in cancer research. And it was not published. It is typewritten, but not typeset. The pages are not numbered.

Despite the fact that it is written in clear and concise language by a highly educated person, there are about a dozen minor errata in the few pages we have. Any reader would have noticed this one: “Control” is a curious omission for a document written by an experimental laboratory researcher. It is hard to imagine that this error was not noticed in the author’s own proofreading, since the seven spaces for the word “control” were left blank. Is the omission of the word “control” deliberate? Is it an indication that the researcher had some objection to the concept of control groups? This will become significant in our attempt to identify the author. This sounds like a recommendation written by a subordinate for the explicit purpose of extending an invitation to Dr. Gregory to demonstrate his antibiotic. It is unlikely that Dr. Gregory would have traveled across the country on the invitation of David Ferrie, but he would probably have been eager to accept an invitation from a reputable medical school, a drug company, or one of the government’s research laboratories. Was this document written by a frontline researcher at one of the U.S. government’s laboratories which had the specific mission of battling cancer? A facility of the National Institutes of Health or National Cancer Institute? It is there we find the mission, the equipment, the techniques, the personnel, and the budget to conduct an industry-wide review of progressive theories like virally-caused cancer, a subject that in 1956 was still on the fringe of medical knowledge. The appropriate question: How would David Ferrie have gotten his hands on an internal document from such an organization? From Mary Sherman perhaps? But how would Mary Sherman have come by the document? Just what connections did Mary Sherman (and those around her) have with the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health? And what could have motivated these contacts to send her a copy of such a document? To answer these questions, we must peek behind the curtain of respect and gaze upon the mishaps of politicallycontrolled science, especially the enormous upheavals that rocked the National Institutes of Health in the 1950s. We begin by digging through the wreckage of the disastrous introduction of the polio vaccine in order to understand what followed. Today, many Americans do not remember what a terrible curse “the polio epidemic” was upon the land.

Today, many Americans do not remember what a terrible curse “the polio epidemic” was upon the land. At its crest in the early 1950s over 33,000 Americans fell crippled or died slow, terrible deaths from polio each year. Most were children. The word “polio” struck fear into the hearts of parents across America. It was a casually transmitted virus that first infected the lining of the intestines, then the blood stream, and finally the nervous system, where it destroyed the victim’s brain stem. The difference between crippled and dead was determined by the extent of the damage to the brain stem. Cavernous hospital wards full of hideous looking machines called “iron lungs” awaited patients who became too weak to breathe for themselves. President Franklin Roosevelt himself was crippled by polio before he entered the White House. The search for a polio vaccine became a national scientific effort supported by the most powerful political forces in the land. The problem was this: Polio was caused by a virus, not a bacteria, and viruses do not respond to antibiotics. So, despite the spectacular success of antibiotics introduced to the American clinical scene in 1942, the medical community was powerless to stop this virus from crippling and killing. A New York City lawyer close to President Roosevelt organized The March of Dimes, and collected millions of dollars of coins from grade school children across the country to finance the research effort.3 The progress was encouraging. By the early 1950s, American scien - tist Jonas Salk came forward with a brave new idea to eliminate all three strains of polio at once: Grow the polio viruses in the lab, kill them, then inject healthy children with the dead viruses. The dead viruses would not be able to reproduce, so they would not harm the children, but their immune systems would detect the presence of the invading viruses and would rally to defend the body, producing a hefty supply of antibodies in the process. At the eleventh hour a bacteriologist at NIH was told to safety-test the new polio vaccine. Her name was Bernice Eddy, M.D., PhD.5 When she injected the polio vaccine into her monkeys, they fell paralyzed in their cages. Eddy realized that the virus in the vaccine was not dead as promised, but still alive and ready to breed. It was time to sound the alarm.

Should the mass inoculation A handful of prominent doctors across the country stepped into the fray to throw the weight of their reputations on the side of the vaccine. One of these doctors was Mary Sherman’s boss, Dr. Alton Ochsner. To demonstrate his conviction that the vaccine was really ready, he inoculated his own grandchildren with it. The mass inoculation proceeded on schedule. Within days, children fell sick from polio, some were crippled, some died. Estimates vary dramatically. Ochsner’s grandson died. His granddaughter contracted polio but survived. An enormous lawsuit erupted. Heads rolled everywhere.6 The Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare (Oveta Hobby) stepped down. The Director of the National Institutes of Health (Dr. William Sebrell) resigned. It was the biggest fiasco in medical history. A second, safer vaccine developed by Albert Sabin was deployed. It used a weakened live virus instead of a dead virus. It worked. Polio was history. The future was safe … or so it seemed. In the aftermath of the debacle, Bernice Eddy was taken off polio research and transferred to the influenza section by the thankless NIH management. She shared her frustrations with a small group of women scientists who ate brown-bag lunches on the steps of one of the laboratories. There Eddy met a tenacious scientist named Sarah Stewart, M.D., PhD., who was waging her own battle against the official paradigms of bureaucratic medicine. Bernice Eddy and Sarah Stewart became close friends.7 Sarah Stewart’s name remains virtually unknown today, despite her huge contribution to modern medicine. Not only did she prove that some cancers were caused by viruses, but subsequent research on the virus she discovered led to the discovery of DNA recombination, which is one of the most powerful tools in medical research today. Raised in the fertile Rio Grande Valley on the Mexican border, Stewart’s educational odyssey ranged from the New Mexico Agricultural College in 1927 to a Ph.D. in bacteriology from the University of Chicago in 1939. Next, Stewart went to work for the National Institutes of Health as a bacteriologist for five years. Believing that having a Ph.D. instead of an M.D. was holding back her career advancement, she entered Georgetown Medical School and earned her M.D. in 1947. Then she joined the National Cancer Institute, and stayed there until reassigned to the U.S. Public Health Service in 1960. From the beginning, Sarah Stewart promoted the idea that cancer was caused by viruses.

From the beginning, Sarah Stewart promoted the idea that cancer was caused by viruses. Due to this, she was not well accepted by the NIH or NCI staffs, who described her as “an eccentric lady” determined to prove her theory was right: “No one believed her …”8 Finally, she was given access to an NCI laboratory in Bethesda, where she could try to prove her theories. In 1953, she almost succeeded, but her work was not accepted by the ruling crowd at NIH. They found her methods sloppy, and objected to the fact that she did not culture her viruses. As her work progressed, she realized that she stood on the edge of an extremely important discovery and became very protective of her techniques.11 In staff presentations, she would bewilder NIH pathologists by showing them slides of things they had never seen before. Then when they asked how she produced her results, she would giggle and say, “It’s a secret.” To quote her supervisor Alan abson: “She drove everybody crazy.” One of her procedurl anomalies was that she never did control groups, saying, “They only confuse you.”12 In 1957 Stewart and Eddy discovered the polyoma virus, which produced several types of cancer in a variety of small mammals. Polyoma proved that some cancers were indeed caused by viruses. Her discovery officially threw open the doors of cancer virology. As Rabson phrased it: “Suddenly the whole place just exploded after Sarah found polyoma.” It was the beginning of a new era of hope. But it raised some dark questions about earlier deeds. Before long Yale’s laboratory discovered that the polyoma virus that had produced the can in Stewart’s mice and hamsters turned out to act like Simian Virus #40 (SV-40), a monkey virus that caused cancer.13 In June 1959 Bernice Eddy, who was still officially assigned to the flu vaccine project, began thinking about the polio vaccine again. This time she was worried about something much deeper than polio. The vaccine’s manufacturers had grown their polio viruses on the kidneys of monkeys. And when they removed the polio virus from the monkeys’ kidneys, they also removed an unknown number of other monkey viruses. In October 1960, one month before the Kennedy/Nixon presidential debate, Eddy gave a talk to the New York Cancer Society and, without warning NIH in advance, announced that she had examined monkey kidney cells in which the polio virus was grown, and had found they were infected with cancer-causing viruses.14 Her implication was clear: There were cancer-causing monkey viruses in the polio vaccine!

This was tantamount to forecasting an epidemic of cancer in America. When the word got back to her NIH bosses, they exploded. No suggestion of cancer-causing monkey viruses in the polio vaccine was welcomed at NIH. When the cussing stopped, they crushed Bernice Eddy professionally. They took away her lab, destroyed her animals, put her under a gag order, prevented her from attending professional meetings, and delayed publication of her scientific papers. In the words of Edward Shorter, author of The Health Century: “Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community.” Later it became the subject of a Congressional inquiry.15 In the words of Dr. Lawrence Kilham, a fellow NIH researcher who wrote a letter of protest to the U.S. Surgeon General’s office: “The presence of a cancer virus in the polio virus vaccine is the matter demanding full investigation.”16 And further: “Dr Eddy’s case, to many of us, represents a somewhat Prussian-like attempt to hinder an outstanding scientist.”17 Eddy, however, was not the only one who investigated the issue. A viral specialist named Laurella McClelland, working for vaccine developer Maurice Hilleman in Philadelphia, found similar problems in the polio vaccine. The essence of the problem was that SV-40 did not cause cancer in its natural host, an Asian monkey. But what would it do in another primate that had never been exposed to it? One whose immune system had not been sensitized to SV-40? Like Stewart and Eddy, Hilleman knew that the population of laboratory animals was hopelessly cross-infected with all sorts of viruses. Monkeys from different continents were frequently caged together. It would be impossible to guarantee that any monkey in the American laboratory population had not been exposed to SV-40 at some point in the past. Hilleman needed clean monkeys caught in the wild. To avoid any last minute contamination, he completely by-passed the commercial animal importing network. He arranged to have a group of Green Monkeys caught in Africa and sent to Philadelphia via Madrid, an airport which normally did not handle any animal traffic. His own drivers picked up the clean monkeys at the Philadelphia airport and brought them straight to his lab. When injected with SV-40, these clean African green monkeys developed cancer. Hilleman announced these findings at a medical conference in Copenhagen. But it was not news to the NIH staffers in the audience.

The insiders already knew there was a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine,18 but they had not announced it. It was the public that did not know. Should the public have been told? It is difficult for us who have seen the enormous press coverage of AIDS to understand the indolent response of the 1960s press on this subject. Was it really their job to prevent public panic? Did they cower in the face of scientific authority? Were they lazy? Or stupid? Or arrogant? Or were they told not to run the story by political forces? It is hard to say. But there is evidence that the word leaked out anyway. In the spring of 1961, one of Eddy’s co-workers published a medical article which said there was live SV-40 in the polio vaccine. Eddy herself confirmed that the SV-40 monkey virus was causing cancer in hamsters as well as monkeys, proving that it was capable of crossing the species barrier. But she was not allowed to release the information until a year later. NIH notified the U.S. Surgeon General that “future polio vaccines would be free of SV − 40_(⋅)^(′′′) On July 26, 1961, the New York Times reported two vaccine manufacturers were withdrawing their polio vaccines “until they can eliminate a monkey virus.” The article ran on page 33, with no mention of cancer. Seven months later, a second article in the New York Times mentioned the possibility of cancer in the polio vaccine. That article ran on page 27.20 There the story died, and the specter of an approaching epidemic of cancer silently rose on the horizon. On the heels of the polio fiasco, the medical hierarchy feared the judgment of the masses. Their ability to destroy a painstakingly constructed scientific career overnight had been clearly proved. Another spate of bad news might shatter the public’s confidence in vaccines altogether. Where would the world be then? Where would the public health establishment be then? As SV-40 discoverer Maurice Hilleman put it, the government kept the contamination of the polio vaccine secret to “avoid public hysteria.”21 We are reminded of the scene in Frankenstein when a crowd of superstitious villagers gathered at the castle gate, angrily waving their pitchforks and torches in the air, demanding to know what evil was going on inside the doctor’s laboratory. To quote the words of polio vaccine developer Albert Sabin: “I think to release certain information prematurely is not a public service.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:126:b6c532136980", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3056, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "Maurice Hilleman put it, the government kept the contamination of the polio vaccine secret to “avoid public hysteria.”21 We are reminded of the scene in Frankenstein when a crowd of superstitious villagers gathered at the castle gate, angrily waving their pitchforks and torches in the air, demanding to know what evil was going on inside the doctor’s laboratory. To quote the words of polio vaccine developer Albert Sabin: “I think to release certain information prematurely is not a public service. There’s too much scaring the public unnecessarily. Oh, your children were injected with a cancer virus and all that. That’s not very good!”22 “Unnecessarily”? Wasn’t there still time to try and do something about it? Shouldn’t someone at least try? Sabin might as well have said, “I prefer my tombstone read, ‘The Vanquisher of Polio,’ and not, ‘The Father of the Great Cancer Epidemic.’” His attempt to hide behind the apron of “public service” is no more than an attempt to avoid both responsibility and the unpleasant experience of facing the angry public. I am sure we would all prefer not to be held accountable for our blunders. The more important question: Was Eddy’s prediction of a cancer epidemic accurate? Did the epidemic ever happen? If it did, wouldn’t it show up in the cancer statistics? Wouldn’t the great wizards of medicine tell us if there was really an epidemic? Wouldn’t the press jump all over it? Given the times, I decided to check the numbers myself. A real epidemic should be easy to spot due to its size. So I dug out the cancer statistics published by the National Cancer Institute in 1989 and started reading related literature. Two things became clear: 2. We were in the midst of an ongoing cancer epidemic. Despite the improvements in cancer treatment which had decreased the age-adjusted, per capita death rate slightly, the hard fact remained: Americans were getting cancer faster than ever! Reporting on a 1994 article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the front page of USA Today stated, “Baby boomers are much more likely to get cancer than their grandparents were at the same age.”23 And further, “Men born between 1948 and 1957 have three times as much cancer not related to smoking as men born in the late 1800s.” Why? Per USA Today: “The study’s researchers insist the increase cannot be fully explained by smoking, better diagnosis, or an aging population.” In the words of U.S. Public Health Service official Devra Lee Davis: “There’s something else going on.”24 I am not a biostatistician, but John Bailar III was when he worked for the National Cancer Institute. When he told these sad facts to Congress in 1991, NCI’s response was “absolute rage.”25 His subsequent tenure there was brief. That “something else going on” may also help explain why the summary cancer data we have available to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:127:2afa63e3a683", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3057, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "better diagnosis, or an aging population.” In the words of U.S. Public Health Service official Devra Lee Davis: “There’s something else going on.”24 I am not a biostatistician, but John Bailar III was when he worked for the National Cancer Institute. When he told these sad facts to Congress in 1991, NCI’s response was “absolute rage.”25 His subsequent tenure there was brief. That “something else going on” may also help explain why the summary cancer data we have available to us ends in 1988 (Document B, p. 353). Despite the $22, 000, 000, 000 spent on research during the twenty-year-old War on Cancer, little progress had been made in prevention and some areas had gotten dramatically worse. The bottom line for the cancer establishment was that the NCI’s initial lofty goal of a 50% reduction in the cancer rate by the end of the century had to be abandoned.26 The “war” may have stimulated additional billions of dollars of funding in its day, but well before the end of the century, it became indefensible. The reality is that 1988 saw a 20% total increase in cancers versus 1973! But as is true with most averages, the 20% increase does not tell the whole story. The vast majority of cancers remained relatively stable versus 1973. The 20% increase is the result of five cancers which increased dramatically: lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma, and melanoma of the skin. The rest of the cancers did not increase significantly during the same period. Remember the dreaded polio epidemic of the 1950s with its 33,000 cases of polio each year. Compare that to these numbers from 1994: 182,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed; 200,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed; 500,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed. The increase in any one of these diseases in the years since 1985 was greater than the entire polio epidemic at its peak! Since 1985? Yes, 1955 + 30 years is 1985. A ten-year-old who received the polio vaccine in 1955 turned 40 in 1985! The graph entitled “The Cancer Epidemic” shows the situation clearly. It depicts the percentage increase in the incidence rate compared to the base year 1973. (The NCI age-adjusted the numbers to keep the aging baby-boomer age wave from inflating the picture.) The first thing to notice is what didn’t happen. Look at the line entitled “All other sites combined.” 1988 shows a 0% increase over 1973. This includes leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, and cancers of the brain, colon, bladder, rectum, larynx, pancreas, kidney, stomach, ovary, testes, cervix, uterus, thyroid, esophagus, and liver. For some reason, bone cancers are not mentioned. Next is the lung cancer line. Lung cancer statistics were terrible for both men and women. Both sexes showed a long, steady increase in both incidence rates and mortality rates over the 16 years from 1973 to 1988. This upward trend had been consistent", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:128:9a4332dac34e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3058, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "increase over 1973.

Both sexes showed a long, steady increase in both incidence rates and mortality rates over the 16 years from 1973 to 1988. This upward trend had been consistent ever since it began in the 1920s, when lung cancer was a virtually non-existent disease. The general consensus had been that the dramatic, but consistent, rise in lung cancer is a result of cigarette smoking, so we will isolate it from our search for Eddy’s epidemic of viral cancer. But it is sobering to think that the 500,000 annual cases of this one disease consumed approximately $50, 000, 000, 000 worth of our medical insurance premiums each year. That’s twice as much money as was spent on the War on Cancer over those 20 years! If you’re like most of us and have problem thinking in billions, then try this: In the U.S. alone, we were spending $137, 000, 000 every day on the treatment of one disease. Publicly, professionals expressed bewilderment over the breast cancer statistics. The explanations they did offer were feeble. The most commonly heard: “early detection.” Early detection certainly helps treatment and the death rate, but it does not significantly affect the incidence rate. All early detection does to the incidence rate is borrow a fraction of cases from the next year or two. That lowers next year’s incidence rate unless it too borrows from the following years with early detection. In other words, it has no long-term effect on the incidence numbers. The ten year period shown in the above graph reveals an over 30 per cent increase in the rate of breast cancer. What this works out to is breast cancer in American women grew from 130,000 cases per year to over 180,000 cases per year. Is the sudden appearance of 50,000 additional cases of breast cancer per year an epidemic? Polio was considered a major epidemic with only 33,000 total cases per year! Why was breast cancer not considered an epidemic at 180,000 cases per year? These breast cancer numbers alone eclipse the polio numbers of the 1950s. Then add the 200,000 cases of prostate cancer … then add lymphoma … then add skin cancer…. We should ask ourselves the obvious question: Why have we not heard more about this enormous epidemic of soft tissue cancers? Could it be because the billions of dollars which the U.S. government gave to NCI and NIH failed to produce a solution in time?

Despite the fact that the viral nature of several cancers had been proven by government scientists nearly forty years earlier, the 1994 edition of the American Cancer Society’s publication Cancer Facts & Figures did not even mention “virus” among the possible causes of the most alarming increase in cancer ever recorded. Why? Today, however, there is abundant evidence of a variety of simian viruses found in the human blood supply. Of particular concern is the DNA from SV-40 repeatedly extracted from several types of tumors, including brain, bone, and previously-rare chest cancers.29 In the words of former FDA virologist John Martin, M.D., Ph.D., “SV-40 infection is now widespread within the human population almost certainly as a result of the polio vaccine.”30 Did dozens of monkey viruses get into the human blood supply from the polio vaccine? Did they con- taminate both the Salk and Sabin vac-cines? Were these the same vaccines given to millions of children in both the United from the U.S. Government’s own Journal of the National Cancer Institute: “In the 1950s, SV-40 was one of several dozen viruses that contaminated the original Salk and Sabin polio vaccines administered to millions of school children in th United States and Europe.”31 The vaccine contamina with SV-40 was injected into trusting children until Forty-one years later, an in-depth investigation by journalists Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher finally documented this same public health disaster in the detail which it deserves, including interviews with many of the scientists involved. The 2004 title speaks for itself, The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed. Enough said. Bernice Eddy obviously thought the possibility of an upcoming epidemic of viral cancer was real. Why else would she have risked her career and her pension by announcing her findings to the medical community without NIH’s knowledge? Did she fear that political interests at NIH would bury her warning, like they did when she sent them photos of the monkeys paralyzed by Salk’s vaccine? Or was she just concerned that the glacially slow gears of bureaucratic science would not move fast enough to produce a solution in time? It may already have been too late. The viral damage to the genetic structure of the cell may take place very early in the infection. In 1959 Eddy explained it this way: In 1995, it was explained this way: If the growth-controlling ras gene is somehow damaged, it may become stuck in the “on” position.33 Either way,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:130:806769550d21", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3060, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "was she just concerned that the glacially slow gears of bureaucratic science would not move fast enough to produce a solution in time?

The issue was speed. If a vaccine were to be developed in time to prevent an epidemic of cancer in America, the research would need to be done quickly, quietly, and privately. And it would have to be directed by a competent professional. Someone with courage. Someone with resources. Someone with a reason. Someone willing to take a risk. Perhaps then, a vaccine might arrive in time to prevent a horrible and unprecedented wave of cancer among the American people. If they succeeded, they would be national heroes, praised by the press, welcomed by a grateful public, rewarded financially and socially for demonstrating that our beloved can-do spirit of privateering really is an innate American asset, capable of triumphing even in the mysterious realms of science. And if it did not, at least no participants would have publicly stuck their necks out. Ferrie and the angry Cuban exiles may have been willing to develop a biological weapon to kill Castro, but I personally had not thought that Dr. Mary Sherman (or the other doctors) would have knowingly been party to the secret development of a biological weapon. I did, however, think that she might have been willing to be part of ^(a) covert effort to prevent an epidemic of cancer! Especially, if competent cancer researchers whom she personally knew and trusted thought it was possible, and if she believed that bureaucratic politics or procedures were hampering the process at the national level. The key words are “knew and trusted.” Just what were the connections between Mary Sherman (and the people around her) and the key viral researchers at NIH & NCI between 1959 and 1964? And are these connections strong enough to explain how an internal treatise on viral cancer research from NCI or NIH might have found its way to David Ferrie’s apartment? And were they strong enough to support the idea that Mary Sherman (and others) may have been asked by people at NCI or NIH to be part of a covert effort to develop a vaccine to prevent a cancer epidemic caused by monkey viruses in the polio vaccine? The most important connection between NIH and New Orleans is directly between Mary Sherman and Sarah Stewart.

The most important connection between NIH and New Orleans is directly between Mary Sherman and Sarah Stewart. Both women entered the medical school of the University of Chicago as freshman graduate students in 1936. Mary, 23, had just completed her Master’s at Northwestern and was working toward her M.D. Sarah, 30, had come most recently from Colorado and was pursuing a Ph.D. in Bacteriology. When Sarah received her Ph.D. in 1939, she moved to the Washington area for a job at the National Institutes of Health. Mary received her M.D. in 1941 and stayed in the Chicago area practicing orthopedic surgery until 1952, when she relocated to New Orleans. Mary Sherman also knew Ruth Kirschstein at NIH. Kirschstein, who was thirteen years younger than Sherman, was an instructor at Tulane Medical School in 1954 and 1955. During these years Mary was an Associate Professor in Tulane’s Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and that department’s specialist in pathology. Sherman and Kirschstein had common interests in both pathology and cancer and taught in the same medical school. It is reasonable to assume they knew each other well. In 1957, immediately following the polio shake-up, Kirschstein went to the National Institutes of Health, where she stayed for the rest of her career. At NIH Kirschstein began working as a pathologist in the Biologics division where Bernice Eddy worked. Her specialties were listed in the medical directories as virology, polio, and oncology.36 But since Kirschstein was barely out of medical school when Sherman, Stewart and Eddy were already nationally recognized authorities, I do not consider their direct contact to have been very extensive. However, there are a few things about Kirschstein that should be kept in mind. First, once at NIH, Kirschstein dated and later married Alan Rabson, who was Sarah Stewart’s supervisor.37 Therefore, she was in a position to know things about both Stewart and Eddy’s research that she might not have known otherwise. And secondly, Kirschstein credits much of her professional success to the personal support and professional guidance of Tulane Medical School’s Chief of Surgery, Dr. Alton Ochsner,38 who is known to have enjoyed using his considerable contacts to help Tulane medical graduates find good professional positions.39 Before their careers were over, Ruth Kirschstein and Alan Rabson basically ran both NIH and NCI. The 2001 NIH telephone directory (which a friend brought me) listed Ruth Kirschstein as the Acting Director for all of NIH and the Chairperson for the Committee of the Directors from all of the various institutes of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:132:55cc4e98d851", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3062, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "Medical School’s Chief of Surgery, Dr. Alton Ochsner,38 who is known to have enjoyed using his considerable contacts to help Tulane medical graduates find good professional positions.39 Before their careers were over, Ruth Kirschstein and Alan Rabson basically ran both NIH and NCI. The 2001 NIH telephone directory (which a friend brought me) listed Ruth Kirschstein as the Acting Director for all of NIH and the Chairperson for the Committee of the Directors from all of the various institutes of NIH. Meanwhile, her husband Dr. Alan Rabson, was Deputy Director of NCI. Do you find it interesting that a person who was so close to Sarah Stewart and knowledgeable of her research into cancer-causing virus, and who gratefully acknowledged Alton Ochsner for pivotal moves in her career, wound up in the position to control all research funding from NIH decades after Mary Sherman’s death? Or that her husband, Alan Rabson, who was Sarah Stewart’s supervisor wound up as the number-two person at NCI at the same time? Did Kirschstein keep Ochsner informed about the research activities at NIH and NCI? It would be hard to criticize her for keeping her mentor informed about the progress of cancer research at the national labs, especially since he was the former president of the American Cancer Society and held many important positions in the world of medicine. Additionally, as an expert in polio who lived in New Orleans in 1955, Kirschstein would also have been keenly aware of the problems that Dr. Ochsner faced after injecting his grandchildren with Salk’s polio vaccine. When Eddy and Hilleman broke the news about the cancer-causing monkey virus in the polio vaccine, it would not have been unreasonable for Kirschstein to notify Ochsner about the danger his granddaughter faced. And there were other connections between NIH and New Orleans. Of particular interest was Jose Rivera, M.D., Ph.D., who sat on the NIH Board of Directors in the 1960s. We will note that Dr. Rivera was really Col. Jose A. Rivera, one of the U.S. Army’s top experts in biological warfare, and that in the summer of 1963 he was in New Orleans handing out research grants from NIH (its Institute for Neurological Diseases and Blindness) to Tulane Medical School, LSU Medical School, and the Ochsner Clinic. It is not my objective to pin Ferrie’s possession of the treatise on any one particular person; I am trying to show that there were numerous connections between NCI and New Orleans, any one of which might explain how Mary Sherman and/or David Ferrie wound up with an internal document from NIH or NCI. So how does one develop a vaccine? There are two basic strategies. You can kill it or weaken it. The larger the virus is, the easier it is to kill.

Large viruses can be poisoned with chemicals like formaldehyde. For example, the common flu vaccine is a virus grown on the yokes of chicken eggs and then poisoned with formaldehyde. But poisons are not very effective on smaller viruses like SV-40. Killing these smaller viruses was better done with radiation.40 We are now at the heart of the matter. Did Mary Sherman have access to high energy radiation equipment? We should note what equipment was being put into medical facilities at the time. In 1959 Time ran a cover article titled, “The New War on Cancer via Virus Research & Chemotherapy.” In it, we read, “Almost daily, ways are found to give bigger radiation doses more safely to hard-to-reach parts of the body.” The list of techniques included radioisotopes (cobalt-60, iridium-192, and yttrium-90), higher-powered x -ray machines and linear particle accelerators. 41 Was there a linear particle accelerator at one of the facilities where Mary Sherman worked? And if so, did she have access to it? The real problem here is that the smallest viruses like SIV (and now HIV) are so small that they are even hard to kill with ionizing radiation.42 So what happens if you hit one, but don’t kill it? What happens if you merely wound it with a stream of sub-atomic particles ripping through its strands of genetic information, mangling its molecules and scrambling its sequence? If you do, and if it is still capable of breeding, you now have a mutant. A new virus. One that behaves differently from the one you just mangled. Was Mary Sherman using a linear particle accelerator to kill or weaken monkey viruses as part of a desperate attempt to develop an anti-cancer vaccine? Was she testing the results of those experiments in live animals in Ferrie’s underground medical laboratory? Perhaps this is how good science goes bad. 29 “SV-40 like Sequences in Human Bone Tumors,” by M.

This article reported that “none of the agencies (of the National Institutes of Health) yet have new initiatives in the pipeline to bolster their current work on SV40 …” 35 The U.S. government did launch a massive research program in 1962 concerning cancer-causing monkey viruses. The project injected over 2,000 monkeys with cancer-causing and immunosuppressing viruses. See Richard Hatch, “Cancer Warfare,” Covert Action, Winter 1991-92, p. 17. Was the Ferrie-Sherman lab racing the government labs, hoping to develop an anti-cancer vaccine in time to stop Eddy’s epidemic? As I thought about these questions, I realized the single point that I was most uncomfortable about was the fire. Compared to the 40-foot flames of the Rault Center fire, Mary Sherman’s fire was noticeably unimpressive. Other than the smoky mattress, a pile of half-burned clothes and some incidental furniture, the fire in Mary’s apartment did not really burn anything. Yes, there was a lot of smoke and soot, but no one even reported seeing a flame. There was no structural damage to the wood-framed building. The curtains in the bedroom where her body was found did not catch fire. Even the clothes which had been piled on top of her body as fuel for the fire had not burned completely. Just to be clear, let me state what I think this is saying. If the temperature in the bedroom had reached 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees C) the clothes piled on top of Mary would have ignited and burned. Yet they did not. Therefore, the temperature in the room did not reach 500 degrees. The police, however, attributed the massive destruction to her body, including the disintegration of her right arm and the right side of her torso, to this less-than-500-degree fire. While he still had not given me the temperature number, I was impressed with how fast he got to the essence of the matter. I had not said anything about the nature of the death. It could have been a car wreck as far as he knew. But I was determined to get a cremation temperature from him before discussing any circumstantial evidence which might somehow color his answer. So I politely asked him to tell me the temperature of a cremation oven. He said, “Well, the cremation machines are automatic nowadays so you don’t have to set them, but an average cremation takes about two hours at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:135:2749567efe72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3065, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 136, "text": "anything about the nature of the death.

So I politely asked him to tell me the temperature of a cremation oven. He said, “Well, the cremation machines are automatic nowadays so you don’t have to set them, but an average cremation takes about two hours at about 1,600 degrees. But when you are finished, there are still bones! Depending on body size and fat content, some take longer. I have seen them as high as 2,000 degrees and for as long as three hours. But when you are finished, you still have bones, or at least pieces of bones like joints, skull fragments, and knuckles.” I now had my cremation number, but I was busy thinking about his answers. In the lull, he offered to give me some background on cremations and explained some popular misconceptions. The common belief, he said, is that you put a body in the cremation machine and get back ashes. No, that’s not the way it works. Yes, it’s true that there are some ashes produced by burning the skin and soft tissue, but that’s a relatively small portion of what remains. Most of what is left after cremation is a box of dry bone parts. The next step is to grind up those remains so that they are unrecognizable. The final product is bone dust, a powdery substance that resembles ashes. Hence, the term and the misconception. What cremation technically does is rapidly dehydrate the bone material so that it splinters. Then it can be ground into a powder more easily. But bones do not burn. To emphasize his point he explained that even the skull cap, which is in the direct path of the flame during cremation, frequently survives. “Well, it’s hard to say. Before I got in this business, I saw a lot of burns. Some were military pilots who crashed their jets and got drenched in jet fuel. I would have to go get the bodies out of the wreckage. Jet fuel burns at thousands of degrees, but there were still bones left. I also saw people who had been covered with napalm and the like. But there were still bones left. I can’t imagine how hot or how long it would take to completely burn a bone to the point of disintegration, but it’s way up there.” I was getting his point. If Mary’s entire apartment building had been burning out of control and had caved in on top of her body, it could not have produced the type of damage described in the police report. The smoky mattress and the smoldering pile of clothes with their less-than-500 degree temperature were certainly not capable of destroying", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:136:b6a1c76ca214", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3066, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 137, "text": "or how long it would take to completely burn a bone to the point of disintegration, but it’s way up there.” I was getting his point. If Mary’s entire apartment building had been burning out of control and had caved in on top of her body, it could not have produced the type of damage described in the police report. The smoky mattress and the smoldering pile of clothes with their less-than-500 degree temperature were certainly not capable of destroying the bones in Mary’s right arm and rib cage. Then the critical point hit me: The crime scene did not match the crime. It was impossible to explain the damage to Mary’s right arm and the right side of her body with the evidence found in her apartment. Or to put it even more bluntly, the damage to Mary’s right arm and thorax did not occur in her apartment. It had to have happened somewhere else. Her body was then quietly brought back to her apartment and deposited so it could be found there. A second fire was set to create an explanation, however tenuous, for the burns suffered earlier. It’s no wonder nobody heard anything. Something else had happened to Mary earlier that evening. It would require something much more violent than a common house fire to disintegrate her entire right arm and right rib cage. It would take something that could generate thousands, if not millions, of degrees of heat even if for only a fraction of a second, vaporizing and destroying everything in its path. Something more on the scale of lightning or a fireball from an extremely high-voltage electrical source which would destroy any tissue in its path, but leave the rest of the body which it did not hit relatively intact. Perhaps it was even an extremely powerful beam of high-energy electro-magnetic radiation just like the one that disintegrated electrical engineer Jack Nygard when he accidentally got stuck in the path of his 5,000,000 volt linear particle accelerator near Seattle, Washington. What about the proximity of charring burns to easily flammable hair? What could cause such localized damage? Did the nature of the burns on Dr. Sherman’s body suggest high-powered electrical equipment? Or perhaps a powerful beam of radiation? I realized I finally had to get a copy of the autopsy report itself. I called an attorney in New Orleans and had him secure a copy for me. The autopsy was performed on the morning of 7/21/64 by Pathologist Monroe S. Samuels, M.D., who signed the report and in the presence of Assistant Coroner Lloyd F. LoCascio, M.D. who did not.

Chetta was actually the Coroner at the time, but his name does not appear anywhere in the newspaper articles, in the police reports, or in the autopsy report. Nor do his signature or initials appear on any related document from the Coroner’s office. The only place the late Coroner’s name appears in the entire file is on a pre-printed section of the Inquest which the Assistant Coroner completed and signed. “Charring” is carbonization resulting from a high-temperature burn, as in burning a steak. The “temporal region of the head” is between the eye and the ear, in the area commonly called the temple. There were intense high-heat burns on the scalp, immediately adjacent to the unburned hair. This is evidence of an intensely focused heat source, such as a bolt of high-voltage electricity or a beam of radiation. “The right upper extremity” is of course the right arm. The “humerus” is the bone extending from the shoulder to the elbow. “Proximal” indicates the end of the bone closest to the center of the body. This confirms that her right arm was missing, and all that remained was a short piece of charred bone extending out from the shoulder. This is the critical evidence which demonstrates that these burns were not the result of the fire in the apartment. Again, such destruction could only come from an extremely high-temperature event such as a bolt of high-voltage electricity or a beam of radiation. A heart is composed of four chambers, two small upper chambers called “atriums,” and two large lower chambers called “ventricles.” The “interventricular septum” is the wall that divides the heart in half and separates the two large lower chambers. A stab wound “on the anterior aspect of the right ventricle immediately adjacent to the interventricular septum” means that she was stabbed dead center in the middle of her heart. The heart is mostly muscle, and the thickest muscle in the heart is the dense wall of the powerful ventricles. The “probe” determined that this precise slit-like wound, inflicted in the exact middle of the heart, completely penetrated its thickest muscle. This would appear to be the basis for the rumor that whoever killed Mary Sherman knew what he or she was doing, and may have had medical training. Examination of the external genitalia shows a through and through tear through the left labia majora measuring approximately 1 cm [0.4 inch] in length. There is a smaller similar tear in the right labium which does not extend through and through the structure.

There is a smaller similar tear in the right labium which does not extend through and through the structure. Further examination of the external genitalia shows it to be essentially normal. There are no areas of hemorrhage around the lacerations of the labium. The general pattern of stab wounds extends diagonally from the left shoulder across the abdomen and groin to the right thigh. These wounds appear to have been hastily inflicted immediately prior to setting the fire in her apartment. This last-minute jab to the genitals does not contribute to the idea of a sexual motive in her death. In fact, given the cuts in the clothing piled on top of the body, it indicates the body was covered at the time the second stabbing occurred; it is possible that whoever did the second stabbing was not even aware that her genitals had been stabbed. Considering this evidence, claiming “mutilation of the sexual organs,” as stated in the press reports, is truly a gross exaggeration. There were two sets of burns and two sets of stab wounds. The first set of burns was from an extremely hot and very focused heat source, and occurred somewhere other than her apartment. The total destruction of her arm is evidence of a very powerful device capable of producing thousands of degrees of heat. The partial charring of her scalp (without burning the rest of her hair) is evidence that this device focused its energy very precisely. Very few pieces of equipment would be capable of producing such a combination of burns. A linear particle accelerator is one. The instant Mary Sherman received those initial burns her right arm was missing, her rib cage was destroyed, and she would be, from that point forward, a crippled vegetable. But her heart was still beating. She was still alive. The question at that point: Save her? Or kill her? The first stab wound (to her heart) killed her. All of the other stab wounds (all across her chest, abdomen, groin, and leg) occurred later, after her death, probably back at her apartment. On Monday night Mary was going to be working on the secret project. This work had to be done at night, away from the normal daytime traffic.

She told her housekeeper, who was curious about why she was washing her hair in the afternoon, that she was expecting visitors from out of town. She asked her housekeeper to lay out her polka-dot dress for her trip to the children’s hospital across the lake in the morning. The children were always happy to see her, even though they were the ones who suffered. She wanted to look happy when she saw them. It was one of the private joys of a childless widow. After her housekeeper left, she slipped into some functional clothes and headed for the secret lab. Maybe tonight she would finally be able to neutralize the infinitesimal culprit that killed both children and adults so slowly and so painfully. Maybe this would be the step that made the dream of a cancer vaccine possible. This new machine had great potential. And it had been put in her hands. Her week of training in Boston would pay off now. Finally she stood on the leading edge of science. She went to the lab with high hopes. That night something terrible happened in the lab. Something went wrong. There was a brilliant flash of light. Without warning an electrical arc of unbelievable magnitude leapt from the machine. A fireball of overcharged particles ran up Mary’s arm and lunged through her body. The massive electrical current and intense heat literally blew her arm off. A flashbulb of violence. Her body was destroyed almost beyond recognition in a fraction of a second. She never knew what hit her. Maimed and unconscious, she was still alive, since the path of the electricity had not crossed her heart. Beyond their horror, the others in the lab with her now had an enormous crisis on their hands. One of America’s most prominent doctors lay on the floor at their feet, maimed and mutilated by a machine most Americans did not even know existed. Maybe they could have saved her, it is hard to say. Maybe they tried. But would she have wanted that? A blind surgeon missing an arm and part of her body? And what would it do to their covert medical operation? Their secret experiments?

The plan had to be implemented immediately. There was no time to waste. Mary Sherman was terminated quickly and unceremoniously by stabbing her directly in the heart. They knew she could not recover from this. Then her body had to be returned to her apartment under the cover of darkness and in total stealth. No one could ever know. One or two team members put on white gloves to prevent fingerprints from being left on any object. Mary’s body was put into a body bag and placed in the trunk of her car. Around 3 : 00 A.M . they drove her car back to her apartment. Using the keys from her purse, they unlocked the gate and the door to her apartment, and turned off the burglar alarm. Once inside they quietly set her keys on the kitchen counter and dropped her purse on the sofa. Then they went back downstairs, got the body, and gently carried it up the concrete-and-steel stairs into her apartment. When they placed Mary’s body on her bed, they did not realize that the body was backwards, with the feet pointing toward the headboard. Once the body bag was removed, it did not seem to matter. A stack of neatly folded clothes was pulled from a dresser drawer and piled on top of her charred torso. Then came the hard part. They stabbed her corpse with a knife in a helter-skelter manner to create the impression of a psychopathic slashing. This left cuts in the folded clothes they had placed on her torso. What happened in the lab that night? Secret medical experiments “under the cover of darkness” were underway. These experiments used a linear particle accelerator to mutate monkey viruses. Her euthanasic termination and the subsequent sham murder-scene were intended to preserve the secrecy of the operation, which is also the reason that the investigation into her death was sent on a wild goose chase, looking for a psychopathic lesbian butcher who never existed.

On the other, my list of unanswered questions stretched to the horizon. It was as if all my years of work were little more than clearing the brush before the real work could begin. The ultimate problem was that I had no way of knowing if additional effort would produce additional answers. Or whether a major discovery lay just around the corner. For better or worse, I decided to publish, just to get the story out, even if there was more work to be done. Perhaps it would trigger an investigation. Perhaps someone would come forward with more information. Perhaps our Orwellian monster would stir on its own. Anyway, I needed a break and felt I had done as much as I could for the moment, and in 1995 I published the first edition of Mary, Ferrie ℰ the Monkey Virus. Ironically, it wasn’t until I stopped writing and started publishing that I began to think about the set of unanswered questions from a broader perspective. My initial goal had been very general — to gather all the information into one place and look for an obvious pattern. What I found was a series of events that were both individually and collectively suspicious, but the overall pattern had not yet produced a coherent explanation. For example, could coincidence adequately explain how the soon-to-be-accused assassin of the President of the United States crossed paths with the former President of the American Cancer Society, who was working on an assignment for the U.S. Government which was so “sensitive” that it required clearance from the Director of the FBI? Could social acquaintance explain why the Chairman of the Pathology Committee of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons had been associated with a contraband pilot who flew covert operations for the CIA? Could corruption adequately explain the extreme manner in which the New Orleans Police Department shut down the investigation into Mary Sherman’s murder and sanitized the reports? All three seemed highly unlikely to me. I began to suspect that the individual pieces had been distorted to confuse the larger pattern. For example, if one saw Sherman’s murder as sexual, it would be hard to see her death as a part of events which were medical, or as part of a larger pattern that was political.

For example, if one saw Sherman’s murder as sexual, it would be hard to see her death as a part of events which were medical, or as part of a larger pattern that was political. Further, the pattern of distortions begged the obvious question: What were they trying to hide? Why did people want us to think that Sherman’s death was sexual? Why did they want us to think that viruses could not cause cancer? Was this in any way related to the reason that they wanted us to think that Oswald was a Communist? In short: What was the larger pattern to the events around Mary Sherman’s death? I began to see our scattered fragments like the tiles of a mosaic which would only reveal their larger pattern when arranged in exactly the right order. Perhaps there was a pivotal question, a central piece of information around which all other answers would orbit. A single question whose answer would define the pattern. The more I thought about it, the more one question came into focus. Eventually, it glared at me like a full moon on a cloudless night. If Mary Sherman was killed by a linear particle accelerator, then the central question was clear: Where was the linear particle accelerator located? And then a series of related questions: Upon whose property did Mary Sherman die? Whose reputation was her masquerade-murder intended to protect? Upon whose authority was the investigation into her murder shut down? I thought about these questions every time I looked at the book, and I wondered if I would ever find the answers. Of course, linear particle accelerators themselves were not secret. As early as July 27, 1959, the cover article in Time magazine bragged about the one at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Texas. However, linear particle accelerators were highly regulated. Under normal circumstances, the sale of a single accelerator would have generated a paper trail a mile long, particularly in the files of the Atomic Energy Commission. But was this a normal circumstance? My instincts said, “No.” Six months passed with little change. Then the phone rang. It was a cold winter night in January 1996. The voice was warm and familiar. It was a medical doctor who had quietly fed me information over the past several years. His kissand-tell stories about radioactive medicine and medical politics had encouraged me at a time when little else did. I will call him Dr. X, for reasons that will become obvious shortly.

The voice was warm and familiar. It was a medical doctor who had quietly fed me information over the past several years. His kissand-tell stories about radioactive medicine and medical politics had encouraged me at a time when little else did. I will call him Dr. X, for reasons that will become obvious shortly. We had spoken often, but not in recent months. During those earlier phone calls, he frequently talked about his long career and detailed many of the people and places he knew along the way. Of particular interest to me was his experience with linear particle accelerators. As a young surgeon in the early 1960s, Dr. X had worked at a well-known cancer clinic on the East Coast. Operating on cancer patients was his business. Day after day he removed tumors and repaired organs with varying degrees of success. The daily grind was an excruciating battle between life and death. As times changed, new technology brought new hope. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy offered alternatives to radical surgery, and brought new promises to both doctors and cancer patients. Radioactive substances, such as cobalt-60, were injected into patients in hope of destroying their tumors. It was a desperate hope. The side effects were often terrible. None of the medical staff liked the idea of injecting patients with radioactive substances strong enough to destroy living tissue. Nor did they like the idea of standing by watching countless patients die. They all hoped that things would get better. Considering these circumstances, it was not surprising that Dr. X and his colleagues welcomed the introduction of the linear particle accelerator as a new, improved means of destroying cancer tumors. The accelerator’s main advantage was that the direction of the radioactive beam could be controlled, aimed precisely at the tumor, rather than emitting radiation in all directions and into the surrounding tissue as cobalt had done. Fewer healthy cells would be destroyed, and less radiation would penetrate the bloodstream. It was an improvement at least, and it offered new hope. The hospital spent millions of dollars on this new technology and renovated a building to house the huge machine, which Dr. X came to use on a regular basis. In this setting Dr. X came to know the people who designed and built his linear particle accelerator. One was Mr. Y, the manufacturer’s Director of Sales, who had sold the machine and who serviced the account. Mr. Y spent so much time at Dr. X’s hospital that he rented an apartment nearby. Dr. X and Mr. Y became friends, as well as professional colleagues. At one point Dr. X sublet a room in Mr. Y’s apartment, so for a time they were roommates. Mr. Y was a colorful character, a Peter, Paul and Maryvintage nonconformist with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard.

Mr. Y was a colorful character, a Peter, Paul and Maryvintage nonconformist with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard. During the time Dr. X knew him, Mr. Y dated a beautiful French woman who danced with the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. According to Dr. X, Mr. Y’s success was based both upon his brilliant mind and his father’s close association with Harvard University’s Board of Directors.2 Dr. X gave me all the relevant details, which I have stored safely. This had been dangerous ground for me, and I had no intention of being manipulated into any accusations about Dr. Ochsner or Ochsner Clinic. Recall that my physics teacher at Jesuit had told our class in 1968 that the linear particle accelerator in New Orleans was not at Ochsner Clinic.3 So I treated all these comments with caution. Meanwhile, I had listened carefully for details which I might be able to confirm from another source. The problem was that there weren’t many. Dr. X, however, kept encouraging me to look for evidence myself, evidence like a paper trail on the accelerator. At first he talked about licenses and permits. Since I considered this to be a covert operation, looking for an overt paper trail sounded like a giant waste of time. Then Dr. X had reminded me that it would be difficult to hide a huge machine which required a three-story building and 5,000,000 volts of electricity. Perhaps there were records left in the files of the electric company. While this may have seemed like a reasonable route for a team of professional investigators, it sounded like a wild-goose chase down an obscured paper trail for an independent researcher like myself. And no one would leave a linear particle accelerator lying around. But he had persisted. There must have been some kind of evidence left, even if the accelerator itself had been removed. Perhaps there was physical evidence, like special wiring needed for the massive amounts of electricity. I told him I needed more information about the site itself. Perhaps then, I could figure out where the machine had been located. The problem had been that Dr. X had not talked to Mr. Y in years. The last he had heard, Mr. Y had burned out on the stress and secrecy of exporting nuclear machinery and had got out of the business altogether. Dr. X hadn’t even been sure that he could find Mr. Y anymore.

Dr. X hadn’t even been sure that he could find Mr. Y anymore. Dr. X said that he had stopped on the East Coast to attend a medical meeting on his return from Europe. On the spur of the moment, he decided to try and locate Mr. Y. After several phone calls from his hotel room, he located his old roommate and invited him out for a drink. They met at a local restaurant and reminisced about old times. Eventually Dr. X got his friend to talk about the accelerators he had built. Finally Mr. Y talked about New Orleans.  The design of the accelerator was unusual. Normally an accelerator intended for medical use had clinical access features, like ramps for wheel chairs or beds for patients to lie down on. Here there were none. In fact, the intended use was in some form of laboratory experiments which required that the radioactive beam be split into equal portions for identical doses of radiation.  The overall design resembled an octopus. The accelerator’s particle gun was located on the top floor of the building. The beam pointed down, toward the ground, and struck a pyramid-shaped metal structure on the bottom floor. The pyramid divided the main beam into several smaller beams of equal intensity, and deflected them into series of containment chambers which encircled the pyramid. The targets were placed in the containment chambers, which were specially designed to hold heat and radiation. The metal pyramid was made out of platinum.  Mr. Y went to New Orleans frequently during the construction of the machine, but once it was completed, he did not go back to the site for a long time. Suddenly there was a problem. He was sent to New Orleans to survey the situation. When he got there, something was obviously wrong. The accelerator building was guarded by soldiers with machine guns. It was a very perplexing situation, and I had to be very careful. On one hand, I did not even want to consider the possible implications of what could be phony information, because it might taint my view of the real information that I had fought so hard to get. On the other hand, I had seen and heard a lot of strange stuff over the past three years. And much of it pointed in this direction. It was not unusual for unsupported information to lead to supported information. So I did not reject what Dr. X said either. But the bottom line was that I could not use it if I could not confirm it.

I decided to gate-keep the information, and not let it “inside” until I could verify it. I needed an action plan to sort all this out. I created my first “information test.” I decided to get Dr. X to repeat what he told me a second time. If he wouldn’t repeat it, there was no point in my worrying about it. I called Dr. X back the next day and asked him to repeat everything he had said to me the previous night. He agreed. I was listening for inconsistencies. There weren’t any. I recorded the phone call and made detailed notes. Before this second phone call, I wasn’t sure if I had anything real or not. Now I was sure that I either had good information or disinformation. The difference might be subtle, but important. I figured the odds were 2-in-3 that I was being manipulated for some reason. My stress level doubled. Suddenly, I was back on the trail, and the stakes were higher than ever. During my research, I had come to rely on a cadre of friends and researchers who sent me information. If I was being set up, I would be expected to rely on these same resources, any one of whom might be working with Dr. X. I needed to use a clean source, someone that nobody could anticipate. Not only did I need to figure out how to confirm the information, I would also need to figure out whom to trust with the assignment. I needed to locate it. I started to make a list of every medical-related facility in the New Orleans area. If Mr. Y’s information was accurate, it meant the cover was so deep that every facility in the area, even the unlikely locations like Hotel Dieu and the Children’s Hospital, should be included on the potential location list. I tried to remember as much as I could about each facility. What I had heard and seen. What they looked like. Where they were located. As I compared my location list with Mr. Y’s story, the focus became obvious: the machine guns. There were very few places where soldiers with machine guns could wander about without making the patients extremely nervous. To do so would attract attention and thereby compromise secrecy. I quickly eliminated high-traffic facilities, like Charity Hospital and Ochsner Clinic, from my list.

I quickly eliminated high-traffic facilities, like Charity Hospital and Ochsner Clinic, from my list. Other facilities, like the Children’s Hospital,4 were better candidates because they were low-traffic sites with sprawling campuses. I focused for a moment on the Children’s Hospital. The very fact that most people would consider it an unlikely location made it an interesting possibility. The Children’s Hospital was located in the University Section, between Magazine Street and the Mississippi River near Audubon Park. I had driven by it frequently during my years at Tulane. Its shady campus was covered with old oak trees whose heavy limbs hung near the ground. I had only been inside the hospital once. My mother and I had gone there to attend a memorial service for my father, who had died the previous summer. He had been president of the small hospital, and they were dedicating a therapy room in his honor. After the tour, we went outside and joined a crowd of about 100 people who had gathered near the hospital’s main entrance for the dedication ceremonies. I escorted my mother. We stood in the sun and listened. Speeches from local dignitaries went on for nearly an hour. I became hot and bored, and my mind wandered. I started looking around and noticed a group of old buildings across the street. They were surrounded by an unusually high brick wall. I studied the scene carefully. Several buildings were visible. All had pitched roofs and had been built of brick in the federal style of architecture common to the years before World War I. Fungus grew on the portions of the wall shaded by the ancient oak trees. I realized at the time that I had never seen anyone go in or out of this facility. In fact, it appeared to be abandoned, all of which made it seem rather mysterious. The windows of the building closest to the wall looked to be boarded up from the inside. The general appearance was very governmental, and very spooky. I wondered what it was. Finally, I asked my mother. She said that it was the back entrance of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, and that I should be quiet and listen to the speeches.

Trucks full of whatever could drive in through the wooden gates on one side of the campus, and cars could enter from the other. Once the gates were closed, no one on the outside would have any idea what was happening inside. Whoa! Covert operations! … Machine guns! I snapped out of my reverie of recollections. The U.S. Public Health Service Hospital was operated by the U.S. military. Here was a place that could have had soldiers with machine guns. And who would go into a quarantine station unless they had to! What a great place to set up a secret laboratory!  Ochsner’s FBI file showed that at one point he had received covert payments from the U.S. Government at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital.  In 1960 Dr. Sarah Stewart left her powerful post at the National Institutes of Health to join the U.S. Public Health Service, the same year that Dr. Bernice Eddy announced that she had found a cancer-causing virus in the monkey kidney cells upon which the polio vaccine had been grown. There were two brothers in New Orleans whom I knew only by reputation. Both had lived in uptown New Orleans for years, and were interested in the Garrison case. I called one (Romney Stubbs) and asked him if he would help me with some research. He agreed. I did not tell him about Dr. X, Mr. Y, or any of the information I had obtained from them. I only asked him to see if he could find any information which might indicate whether or not there had ever been a linear particle accelerator on the grounds of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. In the late 1980s, the federal government had sold (or leased) the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital to the State of Louisiana for $1 . The State renovated the buildings, and converted the campus into a long-term care facility for teenagers. He knew an employee and went to see her. He asked her if she knew anybody who might know about “the old days.” She gave Romney the name of a building manager who had since retired. This man had been directly involved with renovating the buildings in the late 1980s. We will call him Mr. Z. Romney tracked down Mr. Z and interviewed him.

No, he had not seen a linear particle accelerator, but he did see some very unusual things when he first came on board. He explained the situation. The campus had about ten buildings, one massive building which was the hospital itself, and nine or ten smaller buildings, some of which were residential in design. Mr. Z’s first task was to plan for the renovation, so he had to thoroughly inspect all the buildings and inventory the situation. Mr. Z noted that all of the buildings, except one, were in comparable condition, with old desks and file cabinets full of papers scattered throughout the buildings. It was what one might expect to find in old government buildings whose funding had been gradually phased out. The only exception was a three-story building toward the back of the campus.5 It was completely empty. There was not a single desk, file cabinet, or piece of paper in the entire building. It had been swept clean. Everything had been carried off, except two pieces of medical equipment: a large microscope and a tissue slicer used for making microscope slides. It had obviously been some type of laboratory. Mr. Z had been trained as an engineer, and had worked with electrical systems in large buildings his entire career. He knew what to expect. He remembered the building with the microscope because the electrical wiring was very strange. In fact, he had never seen such heavy wiring in a building before. It had obviously been for extremely high-voltage electrical equipment, more powerful than any he had ever encountered. The equipment had been removed, but the wiring was still there. Mr. Z also noted that some of the rooms had very unusual features. One room had metal walls which were grounded by heavy cables. He described the other room as a circular shaped “operating room” on the ground floor. It was surrounded by a group of small airtight rooms which were completely lined with one-inch thick asbestos sheets on the doors, walls and ceiling. The accelerator itself and the platinum pyramid had been removed (and the building had been cleaned) when the lab was shut down. All that remained were the hard-to-remove items, like the high-voltage wiring, the metal walls and asbestos lined rooms. Romney sent a hand-drawn map of the campus and photographs of the key buildings. The accelerator had been located in the Infectious Disease Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital.

The dimensions of my investigation had suddenly changed. This was not a rag-tag operation run out of David Ferrie’s apartment; it was a full-blown U.S. Government laboratory financed with millions of dollars from the public treasury. A state secret supported by the most powerful political forces in the land. A medical Manhattan Project set up in hopes of protecting the public from an epidemic of cancer which the government itself was largely responsible for. A 5,000,000 volt linear particle accelerator had been quietly placed on the grounds of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital so that cancer-causing monkey viruses could be roasted with radiation in secret. Suddenly a myriad of questions surrounding Mary Sherman’s mysterious murder came into focus. Is this where her near-fatal burns occurred? Would the massive amounts of energy needed to operate the linear particle accelerator explain how her right arm and rib cage were burned off? Had her arm been burned off by the radiation beam itself? Or had she simply been electrocuted by operating the five mega-volt machine? Had her clothing been cut off because she received medical treatment for those third degree burns she suffered? Was she stabbed in the heart by one of the medical staff that had been treating her for those burns, to terminate her surreptitiously? Was she standing on U.S. Government property at the time of the incident? Was she relocated to her apartment to preserve the secrecy of a covert medical laboratory and prevent embarrassment to the U.S. Government?6 Imagine the political consequences of revealing all of this to the press. Talk about explosive! Talk about a situation that needed to be covered up! Now I understood why the police investigation into her murder had been shut down so abruptly. It was power in its purest form. The Feds told the NOPD to shut down the investigation, or else. Now we had the answer to our pivotal question, and the incidental pieces started to fall into place. For example, I had always wondered why the damage to Mary Sherman’s body was primarily in her right arm. Why hadn’t the electricity traveled down her leg (to the ground) and exploded out her foot as was common in high-voltage electrocutions. The grounded steel walls provided the answer. The bolt of electricity would have likely come from something Mary grabbed with her right hand. Could it have traveled up her right arm and exploded out the back of her right shoulder into the grounded steel wall behind her?

Since steel is more conductive than human tissue, the surge of electricity could go into the steel wall and then into the grounding cable, rather than down her leg into the wooden floor. I started to see the room as a giant spark plug – full of juice and ready to explode. Her arm would be the weakest part of the grounding path, “burning out” the way that the soft metal in a fuse burns out when too much electricity goes through it. I discussed the situation with a radiology technician. She pointed out that if you had an electrical problem with a machine, the standard safety procedure was to grab the circuit breaker by the handle and pull it down. This would shut off all the electricity to the machine. Whoever was running the accelerator would be trained to grab that handle at the first sign of trouble. If someone had wanted to sabotage the operation, or simply murder a key participant, a good method may have been to tamper with the machine’s wiring and run the main power supply back to the circuit breaker, so that whoever grabbed the handle would be maimed or killed. Was this just an accident? Was the accident really “accidental.” Was this murder? Was this sabotage? Finally, we had the location and our mosaic’s elusive image had started to appear. With it came explanations capable of sustaining our sprawling story. The trail followed the polio vaccine. It all started back in the 1950s, at the height of the polio vaccine inoculations. The moment Stewart and Eddy discovered cancer-causing viruses, top government scientists privately feared there might be a problem involving the contamination of the vaccine. By then they had already inoculated millions of children. They immediately branded the problem as National Security to keep it secret, and it is logical that they would have asked Dr. Alton Ochsner to look into it. Not only was he the former President of the American Cancer Society and a stockholder in one of the laboratories that produced the polio vaccine, but he had already lost one grandchild to that very vaccine. He understood the problem better than anyone. It was 1957, the date of Ochsner’s first “Sensitive Position” for the U.S. Government. Soon the research identified an Asian monkey as the natural host of the cancer-causing polyoma virus, and gave the virus a less hysterical name: SV-40.

Soon the research identified an Asian monkey as the natural host of the cancer-causing polyoma virus, and gave the virus a less hysterical name: SV-40. Then they found the same virus in the monkey kidney cells upon which the polio vaccine was being grown. By 1959 the government knew it had a problem. Vice President Nixon knew he had a problem. Nixon had been given the task of rebuilding NIH in 1955, after the disastrous introduction of Salk’s polio vaccine had killed dozens of children, and given others polio. He had signed off on Sabin’s new polio vaccine. In fact, in terms of domestic casualties, he was holding the bag for the biggest problem in the nation. It threatened to destroy the careers and reputations of everyone involved. The legal liabilities were astronomical. The political consequences were incalculable. It would have been the most politically sensitive secret in America. They had to do something about it, and whatever they did had to be kept supersecret. Disclosure was unacceptable. It is likely that before long Dr. Ochsner was offered a new assignment: to develop a vaccine to prevent an epidemic of soft tissue cancers. It was a noble cause, but an extremely dangerous project. They would be using radiation to mutate monkey viruses. What if something went wrong? What if they accidentally created a terrible new disease? Ochsner agreed on the condition that the work would be done on U.S. Government property. There could be no question about the fact that he was working on a national security assignment at the request of the highest officers of the U.S. Government. If anything went wrong, he had to be clear of personal responsibility, and there could not be any rub-off liability for either Ochsner Clinic or Tulane University. It was October 1959, the date of his second [] National Institutes of Health electron accelerator installed in the radiation wing of the US Public Health Service’s Clinical Center during the late 1950s. It produced high-voltage electron energy 25 times more powerful than that from any other commercially available electron generator at the time. The 30- ton apparatus was used in research on the biological effects of high-energy radiation. This high-voltage section on the top level of the three-story installation would be fully-enclosed in a pressurized tank of insulating gas during normal operation. By 1960 the team was assembled.

She was the most famous cancer researcher at the National Institutes of Health, and believed that an anti-cancer vaccine was possible. For her, it would have been a once-in-a-lifetime chance to have all the power and all the resources she needed to develop an anti-cancer vaccine. Stewart left NIH and transferred to the U.S. Public Health Service at this time. She could have secured the USPHS Hospital in New Orleans as a laboratory, with Nixon instructing the CIA to take millions of dollars from their laundered bank accounts to pay for the linear particle accelerator. By 1962 the machine had been installed, and the secret lab was fully operational. It would have been then that Ochsner and Stewart brought Sherman into the project. They both knew her well, trusted her, and respected her knowledge of the effects of radiation on cancers. All this made me realize that there had been two underground medical labs in New Orleans in the early 1960s. I will call them the Big Lab and the Little Lab. The Big Lab was the U.S. Government’s lab at the Public Health Service Hospital. It had the linear particle accelerator. It was where Mary Sherman apparently died. It started up around 1960 and continued until Mary Sherman’s death in 1964. The Little Lab was on Louisiana Avenue Parkway near David Ferrie’s apartment. In the Big Lab, Mary Sherman was a high-level player who directed the medical research. Due to the security around the project, anyone involved with the lab had to have a high security clearance. Obviously they needed to find someone with a similar clearance to do the day-to-day work, like take care of the mice and prepare tissue samples for microscopic examination. David Ferrie had the right security credentials because he flew missions for the CIA, and he needed a job because he had recently lost his position with Eastern Airlines. Ferrie became a low-level player brought in to do routine lab work and oversee the mice. Ironically, our most persistent question had suddenly answered itself!7 My guess once was that Mary Sherman’s only contact with David Ferrie was through their covert working relationship in the Big Lab. Sherman’s professional colleagues had no way of knowing she knew Ferrie, and Sherman had no reason to tell people she did. But Ferrie’s situation was different.

As Ferrie’s life collapsed into alcohol and drug addiction, he continually “shot off his mouth” about his covert activities to impress his young friends. He used the fact that he had once worked with a famous cancer researcher (like Mary Sherman) to bolster his image, and to prove his legitimacy as a cancer researcher. This is when Ferrie listed himself as Dr. David Ferrie in the phone book. Did Mary Sherman ever go to the Little Lab on Louisiana Avenue Parkway? For a long time my answer was “No.” While I considered the odds to be extremely high that David Ferrie knew Mary Sherman through his custodial role at the Big Lab at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, I thought that Sherman had died before Ferrie brought any mice back to the Little Lab on Louisiana Avenue Parkway. Even if Ferrie planned to use the viruses as a biological weapon, I thought that Mary Sherman should not be associated with those motives, since she was already dead. In Mary, Ferrie ℰ the Monkey Virus, I challenged any researcher to come forward with real evidence to support the claim that Mary Sherman was David Ferrie’s closest female friend. “According to the Dallas Police, Oswald had a vaccination card issued to him by the U.S. Public Health Service on 6/8/63, when he lived at 4907 Magazine Street in New Orleans. It was issued to Lee Harvey Oswald, and signed “Dr. A.J. Hidell.” The FBI reports are in Volume 19. I’ll send you the citations.”10 Here one should also consider the testimony of Dr. Adele Edisen, a Ph.D. neurologist, to the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s. She stated that she had been given Lee Harvey Oswald’s name and his New Orleans phone number in mid-April 1963, approximately three weeks before Oswald moved to New Orleans.11 To me, her twenty-onepage narrative strongly suggests that the location of Oswald’s apartment was not accidental, and that it had been selected in advance for some reason. Was this reason its close proximity to the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital? Had Lee Harvey Oswald been sent to New Orleans to spy on the secret experiments at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital? Now the timing of Sherman’s murder comes into focus. With Oswald in the picture, the fact that Mary Sherman’s murder happened underneath the noses of the Warren Commission’s investigators takes on a whole new light.

Had someone sabotaged the linear particle accelerator in order to create a high-profile incident that would blow the cover off the secret laboratory and call attention to its connection to Lee Harvey Oswald? And what would have happened to the “lone nut” theory if the public began to suspect that Lee Harvey Oswald had been spying on a top-secret U. S. In my opinion, if this event was intentional sabotage of this laboratory, whoever planned it was well aware of Oswald’s proximity to the lab, Ochsner’s involvement with Oswald, the FBI investigation of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, and to whom the trail of accountability would lead, once the public discovered that the government was secretly mutating monkey viruses because they had released a polio vaccine contaminated with such cancer-causing viruses. Mary Sherman may have been the incidental victim in a war between political Titans. Luck was not on her side. If Dr. Ochsner had grabbed the circuit breaker, things would have been different, at least for Mary Sherman. If such a plan to expose the secret medical experiments at the Infectious Disease Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital in New Orleans had worked, American history may have turned out differently. count once-secret, but now familiar, events like the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Japanese cities during World War II. The featured names are usually Einstein, Fermi, and Oppenheimer. The featured locations are usually Chicago and New Mexico. I did not question this perspective until I found a photograph of a scientist dismantling a particle accelerator for use in the Manhattan Project. I had not thought about centers of nuclear research that existed before the project. The caption explained that the accelerator (and the scientists) were about to be shipped to New Mexico for the super-secret Manhattan Project. The accelerator that they were dismantling was at Harvard. The point was so simple and so obvious. It was Boston, not Chicago or New Mexico, that was the actual intellectual headwaters of nuclear research in the United States. Of course, Boston would have been where the first commercial linear particle accelerators were built. At least Mr. Y was from the right place. 6 Jim DiEugenio and Lisa Pease sent me the FBI file on Mary Sherman. The New Orleans Police Department had requested the FBI’s help. Asst.

Agents were ordered not to participate in any manner other than routinely researching published sources. No FBI interrogation was allowed. An FBI agent in New Haven was threatened with a reprimand when he interviewed a doctor about Mary Sherman. Had Mary Sherman’s body not been moved from the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, the case would have automatically been in the FBI’s jurisdiction. Did the FBI take this position to preserve the secrecy of this covert government operation? 11 Dr. Edisen said she was given Oswald’s phone number by Jose A. Rivera, M.D., Ph.D., a Director of NIH’s Institute for Neurological Diseases and Blindness. Subsequent research proved Dr. Rivera to be Colonel Jose A. Rivera of the U.S. Army’s biowarfare unit and that he had lived in uptown New Orleans during 1960-61, a fact which he later concealed from the U.S. Civil Service Commission. Rivera may have been involved in the secret experiments at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. Oswald’s 4907 Magazine St. apartment was a small flat usually rented by Tulane or Loyola students. The phone number given to Edisen belonged to the building’s landlord. Like the other tenants, the Oswalds borrowed their landlord’s phone and never had a phone of their own. Dr. Edisen eventually called the phone number and spoke to Oswald himself. She was surprised to hear Oswald say that he did not know Dr. Rivera, and cautioned him: “Well, he sure knows who you are.” A s we ended the twentieth century, a new plague stalked our planet. The official projections from the World Health Organization predicted that, by the millennium, 30 million people would be infected with this new virus. Other experts put the number over 100 million.1 According to the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS, the actual number was 30.4 million; 18.8 million had by then succumbed to the disease.2 The damage would be worst in the Third World, where population and poverty are the highest and where education and sanitation are the lowest. But this plague knows no borders and, in time, will likely infect every city in the world. In the words of a WHO spokesman, this is “the worst public health disaster ever — beyond anything in our comprehension.”3 Most articles published in the American press about “where AIDS came from” concentrate on the spread of the virus.

The theories published in the United States tend to say that AIDS came from either Haiti or Africa. In Haiti, they prefer to say it came from the U.S. or Africa. And in Africa, they’d rather say it came from the U.S. or Haiti. And many people have heard about the homosexual Canadian flight attendant whose promiscuous activities helped spread the virus in the late 1970s and early 1980s.4 This flight attendant story is an interesting example showing how fast a sexually transmitted disease can travel over great distances and how slow a bureaucracy can be about responding to something that it does not want to see. When I ask Americans where AIDS came from, most of them say Africa. This is primarily due to publicity about the huge number of HIV-1 cases in Zaire in central Africa, about the relationship between the AIDS virus and an African monkey virus, and about the discovery of HIV-2 in Senegal on the western coast of Africa. But remember, Dr. Robert Biggar of the National Institute for Health said, “There is no conclusive evidence that the AIDS virus originated in Africa, since the epidemic seemed to start at approximately the same time as in America and Europe.”5 It is interesting to note that in 1985, after four years of tracking AIDS globally, there were 9,000 cases in the U.S. but only 2,000 cases in Africa, Europe, Australia, Haiti, and Asia combined.6 Most of the efforts to tie the origin of the AIDS epidemic to Africa are based upon efforts to tie Kaposi’s sarcoma to AIDS. While Kaposi’s is one of the cancers which frequently accompanies HIV infections, AIDS and Kaposi’s are separate diseases. Kaposi’s has been recognized as a distinct disease and studied as such since the 1800s.7 HIV is new. As Robert Biggar titled his article: “Kaposi’s sarcoma in Zaire is not associated with HTLV-III [AIDS] infection.”8 It is interesting to note that in 1983, before Zaire exploded with HIV-1, before the relationship with SIV was discovered, and before HIV-2 was found in Senegal, a researcher named Jane Teas from the Harvard School of Public Health published a theory which suggested that AIDS was caused by a mutation of the African Swine Flu virus to which the Cuban pig population had been intentionally exposed, as an act of political sabotage, and which then spread casually from Cuba to the nearby island of Haiti, where it reached epidemic proportions in the tolerated prostitution environment.9 When the monkey virus connection was announced,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:158:bc2528ee02cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3088, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "was found in Senegal, a researcher named Jane Teas from the Harvard School of Public Health published a theory which suggested that AIDS was caused by a mutation of the African Swine Flu virus to which the Cuban pig population had been intentionally exposed, as an act of political sabotage, and which then spread casually from Cuba to the nearby island of Haiti, where it reached epidemic proportions in the tolerated prostitution environment.9 When the monkey virus connection was announced, the pig virus theory evaporated quickly. But because “pig” was wrong does not mean “Cuba-to-Haiti” was wrong. What epidemiological evidence did this researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health have for saying that AIDS spread from Cuba to Haiti? This is an area that needs to be explored further. It is important to note that we have virtually no public health information from Cuba during the 1960s and 1970s. And if we did have it, we probably would not believe it anyway. After all, Communists have always said that AIDS came from an American lab. What is known about AIDS in the Caribbean is that HIV-1 cases were reported very early in Haiti. In one particular case, a French engineer received a blood transfusion after he lost an arm in an automobile accident in 1977. Back in France, he developed AIDS and died. This is pretty conclusive evidence that HIV-1 existed in the Haitian blood supply around the mid-1970s. (AIDS was not reported in the U.S. until 1981.) Further, a highly respected American scientist, Matilda Krim of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, suggested that the sudden and massive outbreak of AIDS among American homosexual males might have been due to infected batches of gamma globulin (an immune system booster commonly given to Third World travelers, and a health fad in the American gay community at the time) which were made from tainted human blood bought in the Caribbean during the 1970s.11 Let’s analyze capability first. If you were going to mutate a monkey virus, the first thing you would need is access to monkey viruses! Where would you get them? Drug stores do not sell monkey viruses. A zoo may have monkeys, but if you asked the zookeeper which one had a given retrovirus, he would not be much help. The obvious answer to “Who would have had access to monkey viruses?” The people who were doing medical research on monkey viruses! Once you had the monkey virus, the next thing you would need is a means of mutating it to produce the particular type of genetic change seen between SIV and HIV-1. One possible means of mutation is ionizing radiation. Radiation’s ability to produce genetic mutations was established as early as 1928 by experiments on fruit flies, and has been confirmed in numerous studies since then. In his book on radiation,Dr. Martin Ecker described the ability of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:159:c6d7805fd420", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3089, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "research on monkey viruses!

In his book on radiation,Dr. Martin Ecker described the ability of ionizing radiation to cause chemical changes at the atomic and molecular level, thereby causing biological genetic mutations. Acknowledging the reckless nature of such efforts, Ecker likened ionizing radiation to “shooting a gun into a computer.” You will change something, but it is difficult to predict what.16 There is, therefore, a serious danger that viruses from such closely related groups as simian primates could show an altered pathogenesis in man, of which malignancy could be a feature. The dangers of such happening are enhanced by man’s exposure in crowded cities to oncogenic agents and increased radiation hazards.17 Today, there are other more precise techniques for genetic manipulation, techniques (like genetic recombination) which have their roots in the discoveries of the late 1950s and early 1960s. So, minimally, any potential creator of this monkey virus mutation would have needed access to both the monkey viruses and a means of altering genetic chemistry, such as a powerful radiation machine. Once the virus was mutated, the next step would be to put the mutated virus into living animals to find out how it behaved. One would need a laboratory full of animals to test the various batches of mutated viruses in order to find out which mutations did what. To isolate the most effective mutations, you would need thousands of animals, like laboratory mice or hamsters, which are frequently used in blood and cancer research. These animals would need to be kept in cages, so you would need hundreds of cages. Caged animals need food and someone to feed them. The cages need to be cleaned. Records need to be kept. Minimally, it would require a technician and perhaps a maintenance person to handle these tasks. In order to design the experiments, to handle the viruses safely, to record data accurately, and to recognize significant results, you would need to have a person with a high level of medical knowledge on the team, particularly knowledge of techniques used in virus research laboratories, i.e. a medical doctor experienced in virus research. Actually, just about every medical school and government research facility could muster the above requirements if directed to do so.

So the question is not only who would do such a thing, but also who would allow researchers to play genetic roulette by irradiating monkey viruses in their facility? It would not be surprising if nobody wanted it done in their facility, due to the enormous risks and possible repercussions. Finally motive. Someone has to have a compelling reason to do a project of this scale, to take the time, to spend the money, to organize the resources, and to do it all in secret. What reason could justify such effort and risks? Would a desperate attempt to find a cure for cancer explain it, if they were using radical techniques which would not have been accepted in a traditional research environment? The Ferrie-Sherman underground medical laboratory may have started with the noble and patriotic mission of preventing an epidemic of cancer in America; but once the work started, once the power to move cancer from animal to animal was established, once the ability to change viruses genetically was demonstrated, once the more virulent viral strains were isolated, once the means of transmission was established, once Mary Sherman died, and once Guy Banister died, then the laboratory, the animals, and the viruses were left in the hands of David Ferrie. He could have easily perverted the lab’s resources into a biological weapon if he wished to do so, picking the most virulent strains and delivering them to a target deep in the heart of the Caribbean. From David Ferrie’s racist perspective, Haiti was a blister in the Caribbean, breeding “niggers,” and shedding them and their primitive paganism into the waters off the coast of America. Its neighbor Cuba was worse, the fortified stronghold of godless Communism poised to spring upon weak neighbors with Russian weapons of war and enslave them in brutal captivity.

On the other hand, I respected the power of the 60M microphone. Whatever they said, whether right or wrong, critical or favorable, would be heard by millions of people and would shape the public’s understanding of events which I cared about. I reluctantly decided to participate enough to keep an eye on the situation. We agreed to meet for an offcamera interview. They sent me background materials to review, and one of their investigators came to see me — a lawyer. Ironically, it was 60M that brought me the witness that I had been missing.1 After I had reviewed the materials which they sent me (which did not include any of the photos of the woman nor the other evidence that I will be showing you shortly), they asked me to comment.

My opening remark: “Well, she needs to be written up. Either in the history books or the medical books. At the moment, I am not sure which one.” Neither were they. 60M’s interest in this woman was fueled by the sensational aspects of her story — that she had met Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans in the summer of 1963, that they had fallen in love and had an affair, despite the fact that both were married at the time. Any TV executive could see the blockbuster potential for a sizzling story built around the vortex of love, sex, politics and the accused assassin of JFK set in America’s most exotic city. They eagerly flew their investigators to New Orleans and interviewed Oswald’s girlfriend for hours. 60M asked Oswald’s girlfriend all the logical questions: “Where are you from? Why were you in New Orleans? Where did you work? Where did you live? How did you meet Lee? What did you do together? Did you ever hear the subject of killing JFK discussed?” And Oswald’s girlfriend kept answering them. Before long 60M realized that their sizzling little romance between a beautiful young woman and a soon-tobe-accused assassin had morphed into an 800-pound gorilla with “serious politics” written all over it. The adulteress sitting in front of them stated that she and Lee Harvey Oswald stood side by side in an underground medical laboratory located in David Ferrie’s apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway in New Orleans, and that she was the laboratory technician who handled the cancer-causing monkey viruses which were being used to develop a biological weapon for the purpose of killing Fidel Castro. To put the icing on the cake, the entire project was secretly directed by the famous Dr. Alton Ochsner (former President of the American Cancer Society) and supervised by a prestigious cancer researcher named Dr. Mary Sherman, who worked for Dr. Ochsner at his hospital. Further, she said, after successfully killing numerous monkeys with their new biological weapon, this group had tested it on a human subject in a mental hospital, killing the human.

This is when they contacted me, because I had already written a book that sounded on-point. A woman had been introduced to me (and my girlfriend Barbara) as “Judyth Vary Baker” at a party near Tulane’s campus in uptown New Orleans in October 1972. The exact location was on Pitt St. near the corner of Dufossat St., behind the Ladder Library on St. Charles Avenue. It is important to point out that our invitation to this party was the result of an argument that I had had several days earlier concerning David Ferrie’s underground medical laboratory, and whether viruses could actually cause cancer in humans. My opponent was the Latin American graduate student, mentioned in Chapter 4, who had previously made comments to Barbara about Dr. Ochsner’s connections to Nazi scientists in South America. At Barbara’s suggestion, we had gone as a group to a cafeteria on Tulane’s campus for coffee. Several other graduate students joined us there. What began as a polite discussion about local lore and Jim Garrison’s investigation into the JFK assassination descended into an argument about the scientific accuracy of my comments about cancer-causing viruses. A particularly volatile point was the fact that I said that this fellow’s hero, Dr. Ochsner, had said that “sex could cause cancer.” Several days later Barbara complained to me that since that conversation in the cafeteria, none of her fellow graduate students had spoken to her: “You have to make up your mind whether you are going to be the recognized expert on the Garrison investigation, or whether you want to be my boyfriend.” I assured her that I was more interested in being with her than in discussing the JFK assassination, and agreed not to discuss it around her friends. Several days after that watershed conversation, Barbara announced that my “performance in the cafeteria” had gotten us invited to a party. Barbara was anxious to attend the party in hopes of regaining her social standing among her graduate school colleagues. She invited me to accompany her to the party, on the condition that I could “control myself.” Therefore, when the hostess of this party told Barbara that she had been a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald when he lived in New Orleans and invited me to discuss the Garrison investigation with her, I asked Barbara if we could leave. Barbara agreed, and we immediately left the party.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:164:55f8f083b4fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3094, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "party in hopes of regaining her social standing among her graduate school colleagues.

Barbara agreed, and we immediately left the party. Two weeks later, this “Judyth Vary Baker” contacted Barbara, and invited us (as a couple) to dinner at her home (without any other guests). I reminded Barbara that this woman had said that she had been a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I said that I did not want to go to any dinner with her. Barbara declined the invitation. When 60M said they were investigating “Judy Vary Baker,” I thought this was the same person. She was not. Was I being set up to discredit the real Judy Vary Baker should she ever emerge from hiding? Or was I given her name so that I would recognize it when she did? I don’t know. For a more detailed account of this incident, see my video interview by Jim Marrs posted on www.DrMarysMonkey.com. When it became clear that the woman introduced to me by 60M was not the same person I had met in 1972, I realized that I now had two separate women claiming to be “Judyth Vary Baker,” who both claimed to have known “Lee Oswald.” Simply stated, one had to be an impostor. With the information available to me at that time, I could not tell 60M which one was the impostor. I hoped that they would be able to tell me. At that point, 60M pulled the plug on the Judyth Vary Baker story. The rank-and-file CBS producers and investigators had worked hard on the story. They were extremely disappointed by the decision of their bosses to terminate it. One insider forwarded me an email written by a senior 60M executive, in which he stated that 60M had spend more time and money investigating Judyth’s story than they had on any story in their 20-year history. To refuse to air the story after making that kind of investment was a difficult decision for them. It makes one wonder: Who really made 60M’s decision to abort? And: Why? Yes, the 1972 incident did cause confusion and distrust among the 60M team. Their only evidence was my word and my memory. But that was their perspective. I, on the other hand, was the one who was there. I knew what I saw. I knew what I heard. And I remembered the names clearly.2 The fact that 60M had a real live person who said that her name was Judyth Vary Baker, and that she had known Lee", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:165:575b743a8693", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3095, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "And: Why?

And I remembered the names clearly.2 The fact that 60M had a real live person who said that her name was Judyth Vary Baker, and that she had known Lee Oswald, made the 1972 “Judyth Vary Baker” incident even more interesting to me. I decided to learn more about this new “Judyth Vary Baker” to try to sort out the facts. I took the day off from work so I would not be distracted by business matters. We met in the lobby of the central library and drove to a local restaurant where we could talk. Judyth picked a restaurant where she knew the owner. When we got there, she introduced me to the owner, who remembered her fondly, and we were shown a table in the back where we could talk. For the next several hours, Judyth displayed binders of documents she had collected and neatly organized over the years, and told me her story, page by page. It was only then that I really began to understand the dimensions of what she was saying. Finally, I looked at her carefully, studying her pensive blue eyes and her coke-bottle-thick glasses, and said, “You are telling me that you personally stood in David Ferrie’s apartment with Lee Oswald at your side, day after day, and worked with cancer-causing monkey viruses so that you could develop a biological weapon to kill Fidel Castro?” I felt that Judyth’s story was an important development. So I called the writer who had said that I had “everything except a witness,” and told him about Judyth. He had written a book about the JFK assassination. He assured me that Judyth was a walking, talking disinformation machine sent by the CIA to cause chaos and confusion among the JFK assassination research community, and that the documents that I had seen were probably forgeries. I begin my discussion of Judyth this way to show how skeptical I was of her. It was clear to me that Judyth’s road to acceptance was going to be a difficult one. Was she crazy? Was she an impostor? Had she made up her story after reading my book? Would people think Judyth and I were some sort of tag team, secretly coordinating our stories? These are fair questions for the person who has heard her story from others, and has not seen her evidence presented properly. If you harbor some of these thoughts, know that I did too.

It is reasonable to be suspicious of claims that challenge our understanding of history. But it is unreasonable to ignore evidence because it might change one’s mind or challenge the positions that one has taken in public. History shows us that new information is rarely welcome. And Judyth has new information. If the answers to all three questions are “yes,” then we need to pay attention to what Judyth has to say, even if it conflicts with both the official and the unofficial stories concerning Oswald and his role (whatever it was) in the assassination of JFK. Even if it disagrees with the self-appointed Oswald experts. And even if it disagrees with some of the things I originally concluded in Mary, Ferrie ℰ the Monkey Virus. Let’s tackle these questions right now — one at a time. A year later, in February 2002, I started working for the Bradenton Herald. My role was to handle its market-research materials, but my position gave me access to the news library and microfilm collection. This microfilm collection had been copied about 10 years earlier, and the copy had been given to the Bradenton Public Library. The public could see the microfilm collection at the public library, but the original microfilm was kept in the news department’s research library on the upper floor of the Herald, which was not open to the public. No one could have anticipated that I would start working there and would have access to the original microfilm collection. If I could find Judyth’s newspaper articles there in the off-limits microfilm collection, I could settle the “forgeries” issue once-and-for-all. I got Judyth to send me a list of publication dates for the articles she had. So the answer to our first question: “Yes, she is definitely the real Judyth Vary Baker from Bradenton, Florida.” Her maiden name was Judyth Anne Vary, and she was frequently referred to as Judy in the press of the day. She is easy to recognize in the photos. Bradenton was proud of her. “Judy” was going to find the cure for cancer.4 She presents copious evidence to support all of this in her book.5 It might help the reader to know that there has never been any dispute over the fact that the person that the press has referred to as Lee Harvey Oswald worked at a coffee company in New Orleans in the summer of 1963. This is reported by the Warren Commission and acknowledged throughout the JFK assassination research community. In fact, I have never heard", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:167:1ec848d5e2ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3097, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 168, "text": "the cure for cancer.4 She presents copious evidence to support all of this in her book.5 It might help the reader to know that there has never been any dispute over the fact that the person that the press has referred to as Lee Harvey Oswald worked at a coffee company in New Orleans in the summer of 1963. This is reported by the Warren Commission and acknowledged throughout the JFK assassination research community. In fact, I have never heard anyone dispute it. Beyond that, I personally heard Boatner Reily, later the president of that same coffee company, state that they (the Wm. B. Reily Coffee Company) had turned over their employment records of Lee Harvey Oswald to the U.S. Government immediately after the assassination. What is less clear to the casual reader is whether Lee Oswald worked for the Standard Coffee Company or for the Wm. B. Reily Coffee Company, since the names differ on various documents. Both companies were owned and operated by William B. Reily and his family. It is odd that a supposed defector sporting an undesirable discharge from the Marines would work for William Reily, one of the most visible members of the ultra-conservative anti-Communist business community in New Orleans. But he did. Lee Oswald worked for Reily. So did Judyth Vary Baker. This document was provided to me directly by Judyth Vary Baker, who scanned it from the original. I accept it as authentic.6 I have blocked out her Social Security number to protect her privacy. I did, however, compare that social security number with a variety of other documents which Judyth provided to me, such as her college transcripts, and I assure the reader that the numbers match. The amount of money shown on the W-2 form is consistent with Judyth’s pay stubs from Reily, of which I also have copies. It should be emphasized that Judyth was referred to Reily by the same employment agency that referred Lee Oswald, and that she started work on the same day. Judyth worked directly for Reily’s Vice President William I. Monaghan, an ex-FBI agent who later testified to the Warren Commission about Oswald. But Monaghan did not mention Judyth to the Warren Commission, nor did he mention that another person was hired on the same day that Oswald was hired. A simple gumshoe investigation of a murder suspect would have started with friends and associates, particularly at the place of employment. A gumshoe investigation of Oswald would have checked out Reily Coffee, found Judyth, and realized that she was close to Oswald. They started on the same day and arrived at Reily together each morning, though they frequently clocked in at different times due to Lee’s other activities in the neighborhood. We even find Judyth’s initials written on Lee’s timecards. Figuring out the connection would not have been difficult.

We even find Judyth’s initials written on Lee’s timecards. Figuring out the connection would not have been difficult. Consider these obvious points: Neither Lee nor Judyth owned a car. Reily Coffee was located on Magazine Street. Both Judyth and Lee lived along the Magazine Street bus route and rode the bus to work. Day after day, Lee would get on the bus at the 4900 block of Magazine. Several blocks later Judyth would get on at the corner of Marengo Street, and sit next to Lee. Bus drivers recognize their regular customers. The bus driver could have easily confirmed that Judyth and Lee sat together every morning, read the newspaper, and talked — and that they got off the bus together near the Reily Who was this young woman who talked to the accused assassin of the President on a daily basis? What did she know about him? What did she know about the assassination? Did she have prior knowledge? These are good questions, and a competent investigator would have asked them. So why were they not asked? Did the Warren Commission send in a gumshoe to investigate Oswald at Reily? No, they asked the ex-FBI agent that hired Oswald about him.8 And that ex-FBI agent did not mention that his own secretary, whom he had also hired, had started on the same day and arrived at his front door with Oswald every morning. How convenient! This raises the question: Did Monaghan intentionally withhold information from the Warren Commission? If he did, was he instructed to do so? And by whom? Was Judyth being shielded in order to protect the bio-weapon project and the people behind it? Several years after the Warren Commission “investigation,” the investigators working for New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison tracked down another young woman, Anna Lewis, a waitress who worked at Thompson’s Restaurant — a favorite gathering spot for the anti-Castro crowd around Lafayette Square in downtown New Orleans. At the time, Anna was married to David Lewis, who had worked for another ex-FBI agent: Guy Banister. Today we have video testimony from Anna Lewis recorded in 2003, and made available on the Internet by Dutch JFK researcher Wim Dankbaar. In this interview, Anna clearly states that she knew Lee Oswald and that Oswald was a regular customer at Thompson’s in 1963. Further, she states that she and her husband socialized with Lee and Judyth together on a number of occasions.

More importantly, Anna Lewis admits that she lied to District Attorney Garrison and his investigators when they asked her about Oswald. Had Anna Lewis told Garrison the truth, Garrison could have easily tracked down Judyth. Garrison was already suspicious of Ochsner and his role in the media depiction of Oswald. If Garrison had had access to Judyth, and if Judyth told Garrison what she now tells us — that she and Lee were working on a biological weapon project under the direction of Dr. Alton Ochsner, Garrison’s investigation (and his whole life) might have turned out very differently. But she didn’t. Anna Lewis lied to Garrison because she was afraid. Meanwhile, Judyth hid silently because she was afraid. The short answer is “yes,” and the evidence to support this is abundant. The photo to the right, taken by the Herald-Tribune (a newspaper in the Bradenton area), shows Judyth in her cancer lab with her mice during high school. The numerous newspaper articles published in the Bradenton Herald tell a similar tale. Judyth was a star science student who wanted to find a cure for cancer. Everyone wanted her to succeed. After creating lung cancer in her mice faster than anyone known to “Last summer we had ayoung lady studying here whose work inthe sex determination of chickens was not only outstanding，but earned her national recognitionsaid Dr.Mirand, director of the program.These young people are brilliant,he said,and we try to give them the opportunity to display that brilliance usefully.” I know a man in Bradenton who remembers Judyth from high school. He was in an independent-study science class with Judyth, and saw her on a regular basis during their senior year in high school. His comments to me are worth noting: “If you’re telling me that Judyth wound up in some secret lab doing some heavy-duty experiments, it wouldn’t surprise me in the least. She was always very intense and took herself very seriously.” This article not only proves that Judyth was trained in cancer research techniques at one of the most prestigious cancer institutes in the country, but it also identifies Dr. Edwin Mirand as running the program. Dr. Mirand was half of the “Grace and Mirand” medical research team that wrote “Human Susceptibility to a Simian Tumor Virus,” an article published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Science in 1963. This article has been referenced in everything I have published on this subject since 1995.

This article has been referenced in everything I have published on this subject since 1995. Since we have proof that Judyth personally knew and studied under these national experts in cancer-causing monkey viruses in 1961, 34 years before I published anything on the subject, this contradicts claims that Judyth read my book and then refashioned herself as a character in it. She did not. All the evidence indicates that she was trained to handle cancer-causing viruses, lived in New Orleans, and knew Lee Oswald decades earlier. This may be intoxicating news for those concerned about Judyth’s credibility and what she can tell us about Lee Oswald, but it is sobering to those of us worried about the fate of the biological weapon. This means that Judyth Vary Baker really did have the technical skills to handle the cancer-causing monkey viruses that might be used to create a biological weapon. Yes, Judyth Vary Baker had the technical qualifications to be the technician that did the bench work in the Ferrie-Sherman medical laboratory. Hearing Judyth admit that as a 19-year-old she assisted Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie, Dr. Mary Sherman, and Dr. Alton Ochsner in their efforts to develop a biological weapon is … literally mind-boggling. Yes, I have my witness. Ochsner promised Judyth early-admission to Tulane Medical School in return for her services in Dr. Mary Sherman’s cancer lab at Ochsner Clinic. Ochsner also provided her with cancer research papers on state-of-the-art discoveries such as cancer-causing viruses. Judyth wound up working under Sherman’s direction in the underground medical laboratory in David Ferrie’s apartment instead of in Dr. Mary’s cancer lab at the Ochsner clinic. Judyth met Lee Oswald at the Post Office in what she thought was a chance encounter. In hindsight, she realized that this had to have been intentional, since Lee was already working with David Ferrie, Dr. Mary Sherman and Dr. Alton Ochsner on the bio-weapon at the time. Lee introduced her to “Dr. David Ferrie” the following day, and helped Judyth find an apartment. Lee was working with ex-FBI agent Guy Banister at the time, as has been reported by many sources. Lee took Judyth to meet Banister in his office to satisfy her concerns that the bio-weapon project was really a secret government operation. Banister confirmed that Lee was working with them on a “get-Castro” project.9 When Judyth went to Dr. Sherman’s apartment for a private dinner, David Ferrie was the only other guest.

Sherman and Ferrie discussed the nature of their project with Judyth. They deemed the idea of using cancer-causing viruses to kill Castro as ethical, since it might prevent World War III. Lee phoned Judyth that same night at Sherman’s apartment. Dr. Mary Sherman was the operational director of “the project.” Ferrie and Oswald were participants. Judyth heard the subject of assassinating JFK discussed at various times by various people, including Ferrie, Sherman and Oswald. Part of the logic that was explained to Judyth was that they had to hurry up and kill Castro with their bioweapon before Ochsner’s friends ran out of patience, and decided to kill Kennedy instead. Judyth wrote a letter to Dr. Ochsner protesting the use of an unwitting human in their bio-weapon test, and delivered it to his secretary.12 Upon seeing the letter, Ochsner exploded in anger, and threatened both Judyth and Lee. Everything fell apart for Judyth as a result. Ochsner reneged on his offer to place Judyth in Tulane Medical School. Lee was ordered to Dallas. Judyth went back to Florida with her husband. For the next few months, Judyth and Lee stayed in contact by telephone, thanks to access to the Mafia’s “secret” Miami-to-Las Vegas sports-betting lines, courtesy of David Ferrie. While the phone company and the U.S. Government might not have been able to listen to their conversations, the Mafia could. However, we are not here to figure out who killed JFK. We are trying to understand who was using radiation to mutate monkey viruses, and why. Judyth’s testimony is an important piece of the puzzle for us to have. Judyth’s account means that a witness who participated in “the project” (as they called it) has confessed that both she and Lee Oswald were operational members of the Ferrie-Sherman underground medical laboratory, and that they knew that they were developing a biological weapon. This is a major point. Think about how difficult it would have been to investigate and prosecute Lee Oswald in a court of law for killing Kennedy without exposing that laboratory, its sponsors, the cancer-causing viruses that had contaminated the polio vaccine, and all of the ethical and medical questions arising from their irradiation of a flotilla of dangerous monkey viruses. Can you imagine the publicity? The political fallout?

Whether Oswald had anything to do with killing Kennedy or not, the exposure of a trial would have created obvious problems for the sponsors of the lab. Like the cover-up which dumped Mary Sherman’s burned and mangled corpse at her apartment, Lee’s murder was deemed a “necessity” to protect the underground medical laboratory and its sponsors. Thus was silenced the man who could have explained what really happened (or perhaps what did not happen) in Dallas on November 22, 1963.13 This may have been part of their plan all along. Today, Judyth’s goal is to exonerate Lee Oswald. She will never stop her crusade to clear his name. I consider the bulk of what she has said to be as accurate as she can be held accountable for. She is explaining what happened in her life to the best of her ability. I have seen people whom I knew to be in the same room at the same time disagree over what had happened there. Disagreement is not the acidtest of truth. Events are always colored by perception. Judyth remembers what she heard and knows what she believes, much of which is what she was led to believe by others. Yes, Judyth loved Lee. Judyth believed Lee. Judyth trusted Lee. She also trusted Dr. Alton Ochsner, Dr. Mary Sherman and David Ferrie. She was really there with Lee Oswald in New Orleans. She was young, impressionable, naive and gullible. Somewhere along the line, both she and Lee were betrayed. But there is a limit to what she knows. Judyth was not in Dallas on November 22, 1963.14 We all need to distinguish between what she personally saw or heard and what she understands or believes to be the case. Both her critics and her supporters need to make these distinctions. So does she. So do I. Judyth clearly states that Mary Sherman knew David Ferrie well. In fact, Judyth had dinner with Sherman and Ferrie at Sherman’s apartment. Judyth is adamant that Mary Sherman was definitely part of the cancer-virus research project that was going on at David Ferrie’s apartment. In fact, part of Judyth’s daily operational cycle was to bring “the extracts” of her cancer-causing virus research from Ferrie’s apartment to Mary Sherman’s apartment. She also clearly states that Dr. Alton Ochsner was ultimately in charge of the Ferrie-Sherman lab.

And that both she and Lee Oswald were part of the effort to use the cancercausing monkey viruses to develop a biological weapon. No, David Ferrie had not run off with the mice after the Big Lab was shut down, as I had suggested. Routinely the mice had been delivered to his apartment several times per week for processing in 1963. This has always been what I called the “worst-case scenario”: the confirmed existence of the secret cooperation between talented scientists, dangerous radioactive equipment, monkey viruses and political extremists in an underground medical laboratory. I wrote to Judyth and said that I needed to know specifically if she had been told that the viruses she was working with at David Ferrie’s apartment had been exposed to radiation at another location to change them genetically? I told her I wanted to make sure that no one could find any ambiguity in her statement, or otherwise be able to misconstrue it, so I was going to put a magnifying glass on it. I needed clarification. I needed her to confirm or deny it based on what she knew? My exact words: “My question is about your time in New Orleans in the summer of 1963.… Do I understand that you are saying that you were told that the extracts that you prepared at David Ferrie’s apartment and delivered to Mary Sherman’s apartment were being subjected to radiation and then recycled into more mice? Do I have this right?” SIV, a single-strand RNA retrovirus, is considerably smaller than SV-40 (a double-strand DNA virus). The technology of the 1950s was not able to filter SIV from the viral extracts. Further, researchers of the day did not consider retroviruses to be dangerous, so they basically ignored them. AIDS has taught us how dangerous retroviruses can be. Did the mutation which changed SIV into HIV-1 occur when SV-40 was exposed to radiation? Was this the moment of conception of AIDS? Could this artificiallyinduced mutation explain why HIV-1 is mutating so rapidly? Why it is behaving so “unnaturally”? If you are a scientist involved in AIDS research, these are the questions I would like you to consider. Was Judyth the technician in David Ferrie’s underground medical laboratory? She admits that she was, despite the obvious legal, ethical and security consequences of doing so. Were they irradiating cancer-causing viruses to develop a biological weapon?

Judyth participated in that operation, and has said that their use of radiation was both deliberate and central to the design of the project. Was the operation in David Ferrie’s apartment connected to an operation at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital? Judyth says it was. • Which monkey viruses did the project’s radiation genetically alter? Was SIV one of them?16 • What happened to their collection of mutated monkey viruses after Judyth left? • Did any of these mutated monkey viruses “escape” into the human population? • Will Judyth’s price for attempting to clear Lee Oswald’s name be the sacrifice of her own? Fortunately we can still ask questions like these. One has to wonder what will happen if we ever stop. 4 Judyth’s knowledge of and personal involvement with the subject of cancer research is remarkable to this day. Upon seeing a 2006 news article about a breakthrough in cancer research involving a mouse whose immune system was extremely good at resisting cancer, Judyth sent me an email which included the following: “We could have cured cancer … decades ago … and here you see that macrophages in mice do it — and yes, just as I have claimed they could…. This can be turned into an efficient and cheap way to combat cancer. Oh, if only I could have convinced somebody to just give me a chance to direct a lab!… And also because they are still just using murine [mouse] macrophages, a first step that I knew would work way back in 1961. Oh, I feel as if my whole life has been wasted! Have to admit I just sat down after reading this and wept tears of anger and frustration for the millions who have suffered and died from cancer, especially children, and I knew the key, but my mouth had been stopped up with clay. I cannot stop weeping.… This is awful, to feel such anger and helplessness. Yet happy that at last they should be able to see what to do…” 7 On their return trips from Reily, Judyth and Lee exhibited more caution. Though they rode the same bus, they did not sit together. They would ride the bus past their apartments, past the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, and get off at Audubon Park, where they could speak and socialize freely. Then they would ride the Magazine bus back in the opposite direction to their respective apartments.

Then they would ride the Magazine bus back in the opposite direction to their respective apartments. In an interesting aside, Judyth mentioned to me that she and Lee even rolled down “Monkey Hill” during one of their visits to Audubon Park. Monkey Hill is a 25-foot pile of dirt which is covered with grass. Rolling down Monkey Hill was a great tradition for kids in New Orleans; I did it many times as a child while playing a game called “King on the Mountain.” New Orleans is so flat that the City built this artificial hill in Audubon Park so that the local children would know what a hill was. The sight of dozens of school-age children rolling down the hill provided the name: Monkey Hill, because we all looked like a bunch of monkeys. 8 Technically Oswald’s employment interview was conducted by a Mr. Prechter, who was head of Personnel. However, as Reily’s Vice President in charge of Finance and Security, it was Monaghan (the ex-FBI agent) that had to made the final decision on whom to hire. Monaghan apparently did not think that hiring “a defector” who had lived in Russia and held an “undesirable discharge” from the Marines would be a security problem for the virulently anti-Communist company. 10 I emphasize that I do not know of any document, testimony or evidence which suggests that William Reily personally (nor his company as an entity) knew about Ochsner’s secret medical project nor that his employees were being used to develop a biological weapon while they were on the company clock. Nothing herein should be interpreted as implying such. What is known is that Reily was fiercely anti-Communist, a member of INCA, and that he provided financial support to some of Ochsner’s political activities, but this can easily be explained by the financial interest of the local business community and the political events of the day. William Reily should be considered as innocent as Oswald, since neither has had a day in court. 11 Lee Oswald’s family had been Mafia-connected since he was a child. Lee attended parties at Marcello’s house, and was remembered from those days by people that Judyth met. Lee also worked as an errand boy, running between Marcello’s clubs and restaurants. Lee personally met with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello on several occasions in 1963. Judyth saw Lee collect fists full of cash from the manager of Marcello’s Town & Country Motel and deliver it to his uncle, who was involved in Marcello’s gambling operations. 13", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:176:1b543906dfee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3106, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 177, "text": "Mafia-connected since he was a child.

Judyth saw Lee collect fists full of cash from the manager of Marcello’s Town & Country Motel and deliver it to his uncle, who was involved in Marcello’s gambling operations. 13 Jack Ruby visited David Ferrie’s apartment one day when Judyth and Lee were there. Ferrie introduced him to Judyth as Sparky Rubenstein. Judyth was surprised that Ferrie briefed Ruby on their bio-weapon project. (Why not? They all worked for Marcello.) Ruby recognized Lee, and said that he used to see him at parties when he was a boy. This means that Jack Ruby knew about Oswald’s connection to the underground medical laboratory when he shot him, and he knew about the cancer cocktail that could be used to silence him as he awaited trial for Oswald’s murder. It is no wonder he wanted to get out of Dallas. And it is no wonder that the Warren Commission did not accept his offer to talk in exchange for safer accommodations. Jack Ruby told Al Maddox (his Dallas Police guard) that he had been injected with cancer cells. Maddox has said that the doctor that gave Ruby injections came from Chicago. Maddox was present at Parkland Hospital when Ruby died of an embolism caused by galloping lung cancer. 14 Publicly, I have always taken the position that Oswald’s guilt or innocence is ultimately irrelevant to whether an underground medical laboratory in New Orleans was using mutated monkey viruses to develop a biological weapon, and whether that project is responsible for epidemics we see today. My neutrality on Oswald is a position that has become increasingly difficult for me to maintain. To my eyes, Lee was the perfect patsy — one that could not be investigated without getting into his connections to the Mafia, to the CIA, to Ochsner, to the particle accelerator, to the biological weapon and (most importantly) to his ultimate sponsor. Who was the person who had helped the “defector” return to the United States from the Soviet Union with his wife and child at the height of the Cold War? Who was Oswald’s ultimate sponsor? Is the need to hide this key piece of information the reason why Lee Harvey Oswald’s tax returns have never been made public? Was it Marcello using his influence on the Louisiana politicians that he was so famous for bribing?

Either of these sponsors could have arranged for the State Department to lend him the money to pay for his family’s transportation back to the U.S. These are the type of penetrating questions that the “lone nut” theory was constructed to suppress. They are the questions we still need to ask today. We have looked at what is known (and un-known) about Dr. Mary Sherman and her murder, which was found at his apartment. In the process, we stumbled onto some very disturbing information indicating that the polio vaccine was contaminated with monkey viruses which might be responsible for America’s unprecedented epidemic of soft tissue cancers.1 It also appears that powerful forces have shaped our understanding of these events to protect themselves and that there are mysterious relationships between medicine and politics which raise significant questions about the health care decisions we face as a nation. We have also looked at what the mainstream scientists have said about the origin of AIDS, and compared that to what we know of these secret experiments and the people around them. Along the way, we pondered the dangers of irradiating cancer-causing viruses with nuclear devices capable of mangling their genetic structure. But since that evidence is incomplete, I will not draw any conclusions concerning a direct relationship between this underground medical laboratory and the origin of the AIDS epidemic. We may never know. And if we did know, what could we change? In the meantime, we are still free to ask the obvious question: Was this bizarre new epidemic caused by a mutated monkey virus engendered during the more than forty years of intensive scientific research, medical experimentation, and genetic manipulation of simian viruses? When I first heard this question, all I could say was that I have known about the generality of these things most of my life. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that most of my understanding of the dangers we faced from monkey viruses came from a particular incident. But it was not from my father; it was from another source whose words are worth recalling. About a year after the pirate incident dashed my hopes for a pet monkey, a remarkable elderly woman entered my life.

Her name was Mrs. Ellis,2 and she taught history and English to my class at New Orleans Academy. Her grandmotherly appearance and out-of-date clothes could not conceal her unique spirit. Her specialty was sculpting rowdy teenage boys into disciplined young men, and she did so with uncommon precision. During her forty-year career, she had nearly a thousand students to her credit. In her own family, she raised three sons, and put each through college and then law school. Then she shepherded their entrance into Louisiana politics. All three of them became elected judges in Covington, Louisiana, across the lake from New Orleans. Very little went on in Covington that “Mama Judge” did not know about. One day, in 1963 or 1964, she concluded her lesson and turned our attention to the new monkey laboratory that the U.S. government was building near Covington. As you can imagine, my ears perked up. She talked about the research that Tulane and LSU medical schools were doing at “the Yerkes lab.” She cautioned us that it was “not the famous Yerkes lab,” but it was “like the Yerkes lab.” As she praised these new efforts to make the monkey research safer and more humane, I was busy thinking about the African monkey viruses that my father feared more than rabies. Then she started talking about polio. At first I did not get the connection. Then she told us that the polio vaccine had been contaminated with monkey viruses. The medical experts admitted that they did not know what effect these monkey viruses in the human blood supply would have, and they acknowledged that a new generation of diseases might result — diseases which the world had never seen. And she told us about the response of prominent doctors like Alton Ochsner who had supported the mass inoculation of the polio vaccine. Ochsner’s position, she explained, was that it was better to get rid of a known disease today and deal with the possibility of a new disease tomorrow, than to do nothing. Further, Ochsner believed that if these monkey viruses did produce new diseases, then medical science would be able to meet the challenge, as it had with so many other diseases.

She accepted my comment and added a few of her own, expressing her personal bewilderment over the people calling the shots. Her frustrations were not hard to see. n the chapter entitled “The Witness,” I explain how I came to know Judyth Vary Baker, present key evidence Iabout her, and give a top-line summary of her story — which was admittedly focused on points that related to my interests: Mary Sherman, the underground medical laboratory at David Ferrie’s apartment, the contamination of the polio vaccine, Dr. Alton Ochsner, and irradiating cancercausing monkey viruses. As important as these points are, I want to enable the reader to see a broader overview of the rest of her story.1 Judyth’s story helps us understand what happened in New Orleans in that very important summer of 1963, both with the Ferrie-Sherman underground medical laboratory and with the broader activities of Lee Harvey Oswald in the months prior to Kennedy’s assassination. Judyth’s narrative provides an important, if not essential, perspective on these matters. In what follows you will read what I consider to be the salient points. The text font will vary so that you may distinguish between when I am relating her story to you, and when I am adding my commentary. Judyth’s story begins in Bradenton, Florida during her high school years, which ended in 1961.2 Due to her success as an award-winning science student, she attracted the attention of teachers and press. Doors were opened, and Judyth was given access to support that a high school student would not normally have. This early success led to introductions to important contacts in the medical community, including Dr. Alton Ochsner, a famous physician from New Orleans, and his friend Dr. Harold Diehl, Vice President for Research Projects at the American Cancer Society. Ochsner helped Judyth by arranging a summer position for her assisting his friend Dr. George Moore in his laboratory at the prestigious Roswell Park Cancer Institute in upstate New York.

After a false-start at a Catholic college,3 and a year at the University of Florida, Judyth was invited by Ochsner to New Orleans to work in a cancer lab at his hospital for the summer, and to be part of a project which she understood to be of national-security importance. For her services, Judyth was promised advanced admission to Tulane Medical School, a stipend as compensation for her involvement, as well as the opportunity to work under the direction of a distinguished cancer researcher named Dr. Mary Sherman. Due to a fluke in her college schedule and problems at home in Bradenton, Judyth headed to New Orleans several weeks ahead of Ochsner’s schedule.4 Upon her arrival she got a room at the YWCA, which she shared with several female roommates. One of these roommates was a stripper at the 500 Club. The stripper explained to Judyth that New Orleans was run by organized crime, particularly by her boss Carlos Marcello. The club had just been raided that night by the police, but that was understood to be Marcello’s way of persuading Jada, the headline act, to relocate to Dallas to work for his friend Jack Ruby. A few evenings later, the stripper invited Judyth to the 500 Club to help her with her makeup. Eager to broaden her horizons, Judyth went to the 500 Club. Another roommate encouraged Judyth to get a job with “more of a future to it,” like the one she had — learning to work as a bunny at the Playboy Club. But Judyth declined this offer as well, and followed the advice of yet another roommate, who convinced her to work at a hamburger joint called the Royal Castle out by the airport. This Royal Castle was next to the Town & Country Motel, headquarters of Carlos Marcello, the infamous Mafia boss.5 Lee befriends her and offers to walk her home. She accepts. Judyth tells Lee that she has come to town at Dr. Ochsner’s request and will be working in Dr. Mary Sherman’s cancer laboratory. What a coincidence! Lee was just talking about Dr. Sherman the night before with a good friend who was also interested in cancer research — Captain David Ferrie. Lee tells her that Captain Ferrie also works with Carlos Marcello as a pilot, ever since he had a problem with his job at Eastern Airlines. The next morning Lee visits Judyth at her new job at the Royal Castle outside of Marcello’s headquarters, and waits for her to finish her work. Lee then borrows a car from his uncle. The uncle used to be “an enforcer” for Carlos Marcello on the docks, but got promoted to bookmaking and collecting gambling debts.7 Lee is concerned that Judyth has to live at the YWCA with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:181:84418424d5f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3111, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 182, "text": "ever since he had a problem with his job at Eastern Airlines.

Judyth is expecting her fiancé, who obviously can’t stay with the women at the YWCA, so Lee helps Judyth find a nicer place — a boarding house on St. Charles Ave. where she can be with her new husband. Lee pays part of her rent and helps her move in. The fiancé arrives, he stays for a day, marries Judyth, and then he leaves to go work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, working on a boat for most of the summer. As soon as her husband is gone, her new residence is raided by the police as a house of prostitution. Luckily the negligee-clad Judyth has her marriage license handy, and is not arrested. Meanwhile, Lee Oswald keeps showing up at both Judyth’s apartment and the Royal Castle. A day or so later, Lee is asked to run an errand for the uncle whose car he borrowed. He has to pick up something for his uncle at the Town & Country Motel. Lee brings Judyth with him to Carlos Marcello’s headquarters, but Lee warns Judyth that the hotel does offer the services of prostitutes to its patrons.8 Judyth sees the manager pass a fistful of rolled-up bills to Lee under the table for him to courier back to his uncle. Once the wad of cash was delivered, the grateful uncle gave Lee $200 (1963 dollars) for his trouble. Supposedly embarrassed by the police raid on her last residence, Lee comes to Judyth’s rescue again, by helping her find a small quiet apartment on Marengo Street in uptown New Orleans, near Magazine Street. The house is owned by Susie Hanover, a woman Lee has known since he was a child. Susie’s husband also worked for Carlos Marcello, and she remembered Lee fondly from parties at Marcello’s house during his childhood. Lee then takes Judyth to lunch with his friend David Ferrie, who invites them to his apartment to see his cancer laboratory. She accepts and the trio goes to Ferrie’s apartment. There they talk cancer research for hours. Judyth is very impressed with Ferrie’s knowledge of cancer research. It is there in Ferrie’s kitchen that he explains that he and Dr. Mary Sherman are cooking up a cancer cocktail to kill Cuban President Fidel Castro.

Ferrie is hoping that Judyth will agree to work with them in their patriotic venture. They really need the help, and they are behind schedule. Ferrie invites Lee and Judyth to a party at his house the next night, promising that Mary Sherman will be there. Ferrie is right, Mary Sherman does come to the party, but she totally ignores Judyth, preferring to practice her fluent Spanish on Ferrie’s Cuban friends. Sherman does not stay long, but before she leaves, Judyth sees her remove a jar of tumors from Ferrie’s refrigerator. As the night progresses, Judyth hears Ferrie talk to the Cubans about how President Kennedy could be killed. The police finally shut the party down at 2:00 a.m. At this point, Judyth is getting concerned that she might be falling in with the wrong crowd, and asks Lee if Ferrie’s secret get-Castro project is really a U.S. government project. Lee offers to prove that it is by introducing Judyth to Mr. Guy Banister, the former head of the FBI’s Chicago office, who is now a private investigator in New Orleans. Banister assures Judyth that Lee is OK because he is working with them to get rid of Castro. Impressed by Banister’s credentials hanging on the wall, and the large gun under his arm, Judyth concludes that things are on the level. Lee then takes Judyth upstairs, and shows her some of the military equipment that he will be using to help make a training film for the Cuban exiles. Lee mentions that Banister also happens to work with Carlos Marcello and his attorney, handling “private investigations.” Oswald explains that Banister used to work for the New Orleans Police Department, until they fired him. Now he gets back at them by blackmailing cops for Marcello. This is a profound point. If Oswald met with Ochsner in the same room privately before Judyth entered the room to meet with Ochsner, it implies that Ochsner already knew (or knew of ) Oswald prior to Judyth’s arrival. As her story unfolds, we learn that Oswald is already operationally involved in Ochsner’s kill-Castro project, running the supplies between a string of secret laboratories stretched across New Orleans. This is a remarkable development because of Ochsner’s public position that Oswald was a Communist and the lone assassin who killed Kennedy.

Shortly after her meeting with Ochsner, Judyth is introduced to Dr. Mary Sherman herself. This time, Judyth is invited to dinner at Sherman’s apartment. When Judyth arrives, she finds David Ferrie waiting for her inside Mary Sherman’s apartment. Now Mary is gracious and attentive. The conversation is a smorgasbord of cancer talk, of why we need to kill Castro before he nukes us, and, more importantly, of why we need to do it soon, before Ochsner’s Texas friends run out of patience and decide to kill Kennedy instead. Judyth’s confusion over the politics subsides when Mary shows her a collection of microscope slides of a “galloping cancer” that Mary had developed by exposing the cancer-causing monkey viruses to radiation. Judyth knows enough about cancer to realize that she is holding the world’s most aggressive cancer cells in her hands. She’s hooked. Before the night is over, Lee Oswald calls Mary Sherman’s apartment just to check in. Judyth is given a key to Sherman’s apartment so that she can drop off “the product” of their experiments when Mary is not there.9 Judyth is instructed to address Sherman as “Dr. Mary.” The trio joke about their names: “Mary, Ferrie and Vary.” Judyth’s detailed description of the bio-weapon work she was doing at Ferrie’s apartment places Dr. Mary Sherman at the operational center of the project, not on the edge as I had originally suspected. The ensuing chapters of Judyth’s book detail their two- or three-day-per-week routine at David Ferrie’s apartment. The basic routine at the Ferrie-Sherman lab was that Judyth and Lee were given cover jobs at the Reily Coffee Company.10 Judyth would conceal Lee’s various comings-and-goings at the building (for him to work with Banister and do other things) by punching his time card for him when he was not there. Lee was given a key to Adrian Alba’s garage, next door to the Reily Coffee Company.11 Then, three days per week, in the afternoons, Judyth and Lee would meet at David Ferrie’s apartment for their cancer-virus work. There was obviously a large supply of mice somewhere nearby, Judyth’s job was to look for the mice with the most aggressive tumor growth. Judyth terminated the mice, dissected them, removed their tumors, ground the tumors in a blender to make “the product,” and then cleaned up Ferrie’s kitchen to laboratory standards.12 The Cubans who always seemed to be nearby then disposed of the mice carcasses.

Judyth identifies the two Cubans that brought the cardboard trays of mice to Ferrie’s as Carlos and Miguel. Is this the Miguel of Chapter 4 whom I met in 1972 when he lived in the apartment above Barbara? Were these two Cubans inoculating “the product” back into the mice after its return from being irradiated at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital? Judyth was grinding up tumors in Ferrie’s apartment when she was supposed to be working at Reily’s. Her supervisor at Reily (William I. Monaghan) covered for her by picking up her workload, and punching her time clock when she was not there. “The product” (tumor extracts) was then delivered to Dr. Mary Sherman’s apartment, for analysis later the same day. (Mary Sherman lived near the corner of Louisiana Ave. and St. Charles Ave., a short bus ride down Louisiana Ave. from David Ferrie’s apartment.) Sherman had a microscope and a device for holding test tubes that she jokingly called “Ferrie’s wheel.” Next, the extracts were “enhanced” by exposing them to more radiation at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. The roasted viruses were then re-injected into other mice (and monkeys) to see which viruses were “best” at producing deadly tumors. On occasions when Dr. Mary Sherman did not have time to return home to pick them up, Lee Oswald was asked to take the products of Judyth’s experiments from Ferrie’s apartment directly to her at the Children’s Hospital. The Children’s Hospital was next door to the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, home to the linear particle accelerator and guarded by U.S. Marines. I want to emphasize that Judyth was led into this bioweapon project with patriotic zeal. We have heard over and over that these experiments were to develop a cancer-causing virus to kill Fidel Castro — or so Judyth was told. Judyth was hoping to develop the knockout punch to rid the world of a Communist dictator who had threatened the United States with nuclear missiles. She believed what she was told. She was not told that the project was run by maniacs who may actually have wanted to rid the world of its promiscuous, impoverished and unproductive underclass by perfecting a sexually-transmitted disease. Nor was she told that the project might give the Mafia and others a covert means to silence inconvenient witnesses as they awaited trial. Personally, I doubt Judyth would have cooperated under these latter circumstances. She has a conscience. Eventually it got her into trouble with Ochsner, and destroyed her promising future.

Personally, I doubt Judyth would have cooperated under these latter circumstances. She has a conscience. Eventually it got her into trouble with Ochsner, and destroyed her promising future. But Judyth does say that Mary Sherman expressed concerns over the safety of the project to her, and that she also thought Alton Ochsner was overconfident in his belief that he could control who got their hands on his biological weapon. Given that the genetically-altered monkey viruses were being couriered around New Orleans by people (like Lee Oswald and David Ferrie) with conspicuously close contacts to the Mafia (and who knows who else?), I think Mary’s concerns about the safety and control issues were well founded. The Sherman-Ferrie-Vary experiments successfully created aggressive cancers in mice and (at Judyth’s suggestion) these new cancers were tested on monkeys. They worked, killing the monkeys quickly. But there was a missing link — they needed to know if their cancer cocktail would actually kill a human. It was decided to test their concoction on a prisoner from Louisiana’s Angola State Penitentiary who had “volunteered” for the experiment. They brought him to the Jackson State Mental Hospital (near Clinton, Louisiana) where he was injected with their new bio-weapon, and died. Upon discovering that the “volunteer” had no idea what he had signed up for, the outraged Judyth wrote a letter protesting the use of their product on an unwitting human patient, and delivered it to Dr. Ochsner’s secretary.13 In doing so, she violated the security rules that Ochsner had mandated (Don’t write anything down!), jeopardized his reputation, and forever crossed-swords with one of the most powerful men in American medicine. From there, the situation fell apart rapidly. Lee and Judyth were released from their cover-jobs at Reily. The game-plan had been that Judyth would enter Tulane Medical School, and Lee would go to Mexico to work as a CIA informant. But Lee was ordered to return to Dallas, and Ochsner reneged on his offer to place Judyth in Tulane Medical School. Judyth watched Lee read a newspaper as she drove off with her husband back to Florida. David Ferrie had also grown found of Judyth, and arranged a job for her back in Gainesville, Florida doing laboratory work. Ferrie also arranged for Judyth to stay in contact with Lee by phone calls which used the Mafia’s sportsbetting phone lines, which were supposedly untraceable.14 Judyth’s phone conversations with Lee Oswald continued until Wednesday, Nov. 20, 1963.

However he got there, Lee was now inside the assassination plot trying to kill President Kennedy, and considered it his duty to stay in position and undercover until it was over, telling Judyth, “If I stay, there will be one less bullet fired at Kennedy.” Lee did not know if he would make it out alive, but if he did, he was prepared to elope with Judyth. They would go to Merida (a city in Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula), where they could both get quickie Mexican divorces from their respective spouses, and then Lee would marry Judyth. If he didn’t make it out alive, he encouraged her to go on with her life and have babies. This is the basic outline of Judyth’s story. She tells it differently, and in much more detail. Her book is 600 pages long. Having known her now for six years, it is clear to me that Judyth loved Lee, and that she suffered the horror of seeing the man she loved murdered on national television. She is very angry about all of this. Who wouldn’t be? She has chosen to come out of hiding after more than 35 years, at considerable risk to herself. Personal risk and legal risk. She admits that she was party to the murder of the patient in the Jackson mental hospital. She admits to developing a biological weapon intended to murder Fidel Castro. She has placed herself at the center of a heated, and often angry, debate over the murder of the President, on the side of the accused assassin. She has been treated disgracefully in Internet newsgroups, and subjected to vicious insults from people hoping to humiliate her back into silence. She begrudgingly accepts all this as the price that she has to pay to tell the world about the Lee Oswald she knew — about his wit, his intellect, his sensitivity, his liberal political leanings, his admiration of President Kennedy, his courage, his innocence in JFK’s murder, and especially the personal risk he took (and price he paid) in hopes of preventing President Kennedy’s assassination. Her take: Lee infiltrated the plot to kill President Kennedy, was set up as the patsy, and was then murdered to protect the real assassins by silencing him. I empathize with Judyth as a person. She has paid a terrible price both for what she did in the 1960s, and for what she says today.

The public has the right to hear what Judyth Vary Baker has to say, and the right to make up its own mind about the government’s highly contested claims that Lee Oswald killed President Kennedy — whether alone (1964) or as part of a conspiracy (1972). In 2006 Judyth sent me an email saying there was something else she wanted to discuss and asking me to call her. I did. In the middle of the hour-long conversation, Judyth started talking about a letter from Guy Banister that she had seen lying on a desk in Congressman Willis’ office in New Orleans, one that she thought might be important. With her typical love of detail and analysis, she began explaining about a note that was handwritten in the margins of the letter, and took off on a tangent that I did not follow. “Oh, Monaghan used to send me over there to deliver messages … a couple of times a week. They were always in sealed envelopes so I didn’t know what the content was. I think it was INCA-related information.17 Willis was hardly ever there, but the staff all knew who I was. Monaghan took me over to introduce me to the staff so they would know who I was when I showed up with an envelope. It was on Lafayette Square, right by Reily’s.” In the summer of 1963, Congressman Willis was Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC).18 In the morning, the young cancer-researcher rides the bus to work with the “defector” who is about to be accused of assassinating the President. In the afternoon, she goes to the underground medical laboratory run by a known Mafiaasset to develop a biological weapon. In between the two, she works at a cover-job under the supervision of an ex-FBI agent, who sends her on errands to deliver “envelopes” to the office of the Congressman who chairs the House Committee on Un-American Activities.19 What was in all those envelopes from the coffee company?

Or whether he was a key player who organized the others? Or whether he was just Marcello’s tool? Whatever the answers may be, they lie in the buildings around Lafayette Square — within a stone’s throw of where the Warren Commission held its hearings in New Orleans.20 Next to the Federal courthouse. Under the noses of the most powerful Congressmen in the land. With the cooperation of former members of the FBI. With the knowledge of the CIA. With the participation of the press. With the cooperation of leaders of American medicine. In hospitals guarded by Marines. With the help of organized crime. And in the name of freedom. With flag-waving allegiance to colors and slogans that mask a contempt for law. With smoldering hatred and flaring impatience. With the cynical belief that you really can’t tell the people what you need to do, because they might not let you do it. That you can’t trust democracy to produce the right answers or the right leaders. That it is as patriotic to intervene illegally in the politics of our own country as it is for us to intervene illegally in the politics other countries. These are the lessons of our Labyrinth. And we have Judyth Vary Baker to thank for bringing them to our attention. 4 Tulane University was on a traditional semester schedule. Judyth’s university in Florida switched to a new trimester schedule in 1963. The result was that Judyth’s campus shut down (cafeterias, etc.) three weeks earlier that normal. Due to Judyth’s problems at home, she headed to New Orleans early. 12 The question of whether there were actually mice in David Ferrie’s apartment in the summer of 1963 has been the subject of debate in the news groups and on the Internet. One JFK researcher, who has interviewed a lot of Ferrie’s “young male friends” about this, points out that none of them recall seeing mice at Ferrie’s apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway in the summer of 1963. Even Perry Russo, a witness that I interviewed who had seen Ferrie’s mice at a previous apartment, said that he did not see any in Ferrie’s apartment when he attended a party there in the summer of 1963. So I asked Judyth whether David Ferrie kept mice in his apartment.

So I asked Judyth whether David Ferrie kept mice in his apartment. Judyth said that she did see a small collection of live mice in Ferrie’s apartment the first time she went there (April 27, 1963), but he removed them when he cleaned up his apartment for the party (April 28, 1963). After that, she did not see any mice living in cages in Ferrie’s apartment on a regular basis. I think the answer is simply that once they cranked up the secret lab work, he realized that having a bunch of people seeing mice at his apartment was not good security, so he moved the few mice he had in his apartment to the apartment across the street. Judyth told me that the mice she used for her research sessions in Ferrie’s apartment were brought there in cardboard boxes from another location somewhere nearby. Each box contained about 50 mice. They were all killed and disposed of the same day. 13 The secretary involved was a temporary covering for Dr. Ochsner’s regular secretary (a nurse) who was on vacation. Involving an outside person in the communication between Judyth and Ochsner was a risky move, to which Ochsner strongly objected. He told Judyth that she should have communicated her concerns to him directly. 14 These untraceable phone calls between Lee and Judyth were arranged by David Ferrie using the Mafia’s secret sports-gambling telephone network, which deliberately did not keep records of the phone calls. This Mafia connection seemed reasonable to Judyth because she and Lee had gone together to the 500 Club (a famous strip-club and bar in the French Quarter), where they had spoken to Carlos Marcello himself. 15 David Atlee Phillips is a well-known name in the JFK assassination research circles.

And it raises serious questions about the composition of the Warren Commission. 16 Judyth’s book entitled Lee Harvey Oswald: The True Story of the Accused Assassin of President John F. Kennedy by his Lover was released in June of 2006. It was published by Trafford press and could be ordered on their Web site. After about two weeks, it was suddenly withdrawn without explanation. I do not know why and will leave that for others to explain and to discuss. I was given my copy directly by Judyth Vary Baker. Used copies may be available from time to time: Check the Internet. A revised edition was published by TrineDay in 2010 as Me & Lee. 18 Edwin Edward Willis (1904-1972) had been a U.S. Congressman representing the Cajun parishes of Louisiana since 1949. A senior liberal Democrat, Willis was a loyal LBJ ally in building the “Great Society.” From 1963 to 1968 Willis chaired HUAC, once the anti-Communist bludgeon of Senator Joe McCarthy. 19 Judyth assured me that Willis knew about Lee, and knew that his defection to the USSR was not a real one — which is why he was allowed to work for Reily: the ex-FBI agent at Reily’s would have never hired a defector with an undesirable discharge to work for one of the city’s most prominent anti-Communists. 20 On July 21, 1964 (the day Mary Sherman’s murder was discovered), LBJ suddenly headed from the White House to the Pentagon for an unscheduled visit. After that meeting, he stopped at Arlington National Cemetery, and stood alone at JFK’s grave for the first time since the assassination. One has to wonder if this was LBJ’s epiphany. Was this the day LBJ finally understood the dimensions of the forces that Kennedy had faced? Was this the day LBJ was told about Mary Sherman’s murder and the bio-weapon that she had been developing with Lee Harvey Oswald?

Whatever Oswald’s role was (or wasn’t) in the JFK assassination, it did not affect the basic facts of Mary Sherman’s murder, the cancer-causing monkey viruses in the polio vaccine, or whether Ferrie and Sherman irradiated cancer-causing monkey viruses to develop a biological weapon. But once I realized the connection between Dr. Alton Ochsner (the former President of the American Cancer Society, who was working on a secret project for the U.S. Government) and Lee Harvey Oswald (the accused assassin of President Kennedy), my aloof position became more difficult to maintain. Connecting Ochsner to Oswald not only rules out “lone nut” as a realistic description of Oswald, it helps us understand how convenient “lone nut” was for protecting Ochsner (and others) from inconvenient questions about both the bio-weapon project and the JFK assassination. Using “lone nut” to cut off further discussion about The fact that Dr. Alton Ochsner financed, produced and distributed this record is itself a connection to Oswald. The Oswald radio appearance was aired on WDSU radio, and the TV footage of Oswald passing out pro-Castro leaflets was filmed by WDSU-TV camera crews. Both stations were owned by a close Ochsner associate named Edgar Stern.2 It has long been suspected that it was Ochsner who asked Stern to provide the media coverage of Oswald. This suspicion was so strong that at one point the New Orleans District Attorney spoke of arresting Ochsner for conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination. Garrison’s staff talked him out of it. Further connecting Ochsner to Oswald, I reported that I personally saw Guy Banister’s files in the offices of Ochsner’s political organization INCA. It was INCA’s Executive Director Ed Butler himself who told me that they had been Banister’s files.3 Banister was widely regarded as “Oswald’s handler” in New Orleans during 1963, and was considered to be the operational leader of the paramilitary training camp outside of New Orleans that Bobby Kennedy shut down later that summer.4 Banister and Ferrie were training Cubans and mobsters as a strike force to enter Cuba and assassinate Fidel Castro. The extent of Ochsner’s connections to Oswald, and his motives for setting up the media coverage, have always been less clear to me. Unlike Garrison, who thought that the media coverage was part of the “sheep dipping” of Oswald to make him a convincing patsy for the JFK assassination, it is hard for me to imagine that Dr. Ochsner knew that he was setting up Lee Harvey Oswald as part of an effort to kill the President of the United States.

Ochsner’s role was too highprofile, and, frankly, his reputation was too valuable for him to risk in such a manner. In the same breath, one might ask why would a wealthy and prestigious doctor bother at all with Lee Harvey Oswald? Perhaps there was another reason behind their association, and a different reason for arranging the media coverage.6 Judyth Vary Baker has told us that there was. Judyth reports that Lee Oswald secretly worked as a team member on Ochsner’s bio-weapon project, that Oswald met with Ochsner personally, and that it was actually Lee Oswald who requested that Dr. Ochsner set up his media coverage to help position him as a pro-Cuban activist, so that he could get into Cuba more easily and deliver their bio-weapon to sympathetic doctors, who would use it to kill Castro. Before we move on, I want to focus on a detail of the dialog between Lee Oswald and INCA’s Ed Butler during the radio program. The debate was evidently Lee’s idea in the first place, to portray himself as a pro-Cuban activist who would seem more “acceptable” to Cuban authorities who could grant him a visa to visit Cuba. But Butler (Ochsner’s front-man at INCA and a staunch anti-Communist himself) was not privy to that part of the story. Butler had another objective. He thought his role was to discredit Oswald as being a Communist. In the middle of their debate, Butler pulled out two 1959 newspaper articles from the Washington Evening-Star and the Washington Post, and read quotes that accused Oswald of “defecting” to the Soviet Union. Now there is a big difference between being a sympathetic pro-Cuban activist who might be welcome in Cuba and being an American military defector. Oswald was surprised by Butler’s unexpected comment, and was obviously annoyed by the accusation. In a tense exchange, he defended himself against the defector accusation: “The obvious answer to that is that I am back in the United States.” This is a really good point. Take some time to think this one through. It has been glossed over for years. In my opinion, the pivotal issue for understanding Lee Harvey Oswald is the fact that Lee managed to return to the United States with his Russian wife and infant daughter at the height of the Cold War, and after leading American newspapers had claimed that he had defected and renounced his citizenship.

Following up on Oswald’s remark may tell us for whom he really worked after his return. My take is that in 1959 Lee was sent to Russia on an undercover assignment for an American intelligence effort, and became marooned there when he lost his sponsors, either in the Eisenhower-to-Kennedy changeover or after the Bay of Pigs debacle, both in 1961. As part of his cover assignment, he had walked into the American Embassy in Moscow and announced his intention to renounce his American citizenship (but was careful not to sign anything). Later he married Marina, and she became pregnant. It is then that he realized that, unless he returned to the United States, his child would be trapped in the Soviet Union. His problem was that the people who had sent him (and who knew about his real mission as an agent and not a defector) were no longer around to vouch for him. The new people thought that he was really a defector and were unwilling to help him return. Lee wrote to his mother and asked her to help. Lee’s mother called and wrote everyone she could (in both New Orleans and Washington) trying to get her son and his family into the United States. Someone finally came through, but to this day we do not know who it was. The U.S. State Department lent Lee the money to travel, and gave him the proper documentation for his family to enter the United States. Whoever authorized this, there are two things we now know. First, this person had a lot of power and influence with the United States government (enough to overrule staff opposition and to tell the State Department what to do), and, secondly, Lee now owed someone big time! Tens of thousands of pages have already been written about Lee Harvey Oswald. The debate over his role in the JFK assassination is polarized, opinionated, and often angry. It will not end here. Many people on both sides of the issue have so much personal equity invested in their positions that there is no amount of evidence, nothing that could sway them to change their positions publicly.

I roll my eyes at the “experts” who quote evidence prepared under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, whom we now know was being blackmailed by Mafia-boss Meyer Lansky.7 And I shake my head at the Garrison-bashers who insist that that everything the New Orleans District Attorney ever said was wrong, as if all of the rapists, murderers, and robbers that he put in prison during his twelve years as the chief public prosecutor should be freed because of his over-statements. Instead, I write to you, the thoughtful reader, because (now that we know how close Lee Oswald was to the Mafia in New Orleans and about his involvement in the bio-weapon project) there is plenty of room for new ideas about Oswald and his role in history, and you have the right to hear them. Yes, I have more questions than answers. My goal is to expand the discussion, not to narrow it. Here I offer you what should be fresh information on Lee Oswald, should you wish to consider it. I am going to present several different scenarios which might explain how Lee Oswald got back into the United States. If I were conducting an investigation in 1963 to determine who Lee Harvey Oswald ultimately worked for, I would have been investigating these possibilities. When you see who the players were, and how unwelcome such an investigation would have been to them, you will understand why it was not done. Scenario A — The Attorney General. Officially, the officer of the U.S. Government who has the final word on whether you have lost or renounced your citizenship is the Attorney General. In 1961, the U.S. Attorney General was Bobby Kennedy. The normal administrative request to resolve a question of whether one had renounced one’s citizenship would have come to his desk. At that time, Bobby had his own set of problems. He was busy fighting a war against the Mafia (particularly Carlos Marcello) and was trying to figure out what the CIA was really doing with the millions of dollars missing from its budgets. Bobby was particularly concerned about renegade CIA paramilitary operations involving the Mafia, since they defied the authority of the White House. Bobby needed one or more competent undercover agents to get inside these operations and report back to him (through intermediaries, of course). Lee was a trained spy who had done undercover work in the Soviet Union.

Bobby needed one or more competent undercover agents to get inside these operations and report back to him (through intermediaries, of course). Lee was a trained spy who had done undercover work in the Soviet Union. Normally, the AG would rely on the FBI for this type of counter-intelligence help, but the FBI Director was his sworn enemy, was blackmailing his brother the President, and had connections to the Mafia himself. So Bobby needed his own off-the-books agents to do this work. Bobby Kennedy arranged for Lee and his family to return to the U.S. The price: You work undercover for me, and use your family contacts to spy on Carlos Marcello and the Mafia in New Orleans. Scenario B — The Mafia Boss. Lee’s mother, Marguarite Clavier Oswald, had been a personal friend of Carlos Marcello for decades. She went to the Mafia boss and asked him to use his influence (which was enormous) on the Louisiana politicians (which were among the most powerful in Washington) to pressure the right people to let her son and his family back into the U.S. Marcello had considerable influence with virtually all the Louisiana politicians, but he had a special relationship with one in particular — Congressman Edwin E. Willis, Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.8 As such, he had the de facto power to decide who was a defector and who was not, and cleared Oswald’s reentry in good standing to this country. The price: You now work for Carlos Marcello, and you owe him a very big favor. Scenario C — The Double Whammy. Bobby Kennedy was at war with the Mafia and was prosecuting organized crime figures in record numbers. His primary target was Carlos Marcello. Kennedy openly said that he would use underworld tactics to fight the underworld. He had Marcello kidnapped and dropped him in Guatemala without a U.S. passport. Marcello was so powerful that he was able to get back into the United States without a passport, and despite the pressure against him by the U.S. Attorney General.9 Needless to say, Bobby Kennedy was watching every move Marcello made. His attention was attracted when politicians that he knew to be Marcello-connected started pressuring the organs of the U.S. government to let someone believed to be a defector back in from the U.S.S.R. Kennedy had his people quietly deliver a message to Oswald: “We know you want to bring your family home, and we know that Carlos Marcello is pressuring people to make it happen. We have the power to stop it, leaving you and your family in the Soviet Union. But we are", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:196:0c82b85fdbfb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3126, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 197, "text": "when politicians that he knew to be Marcello-connected started pressuring the organs of the U.S. government to let someone believed to be a defector back in from the U.S.S.R.

The CIA would have known that he was Mafia, because they were already working with the Mafia to kill Castro. Oswald was part of that project. And, of course, the Mafia would have known that Lee was working with the CIA, because they set it up. Was it Lee Oswald who identified the location of Banister’s secret paramilitary training camp near New Orleans, which Bobby Kennedy’s men raided? Did Lee infiltrate the CIA-Mafia bioweapon project and report back to Bobby on it? If the Mafia and/or the CIA figured out that Oswald was really spying on their operations for their archenemy Bobby Kennedy,12 then Lee’s days would have been numbered from that moment on. Is this why he was ordered back to Dallas?13 Were they putting him in position to be the patsy in the JFK assassination?", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:197:ad85cfce2d90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3127, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Behold a cavalcade of legislators, government officials, andthink-tank fellows.

They warn that if we fail to implement the measures which they endorse, we risk a Cyber-Armageddon. Yet this End Times narrative is a farce, and a pale one at that. These doomsday scenarios serve only to benefit the military-industrial complex. Cyberwar propaganda is an instance of threat inflation. Much as during the run-up to the disastrous global War on Terror. The message of cyberwar is eliciting a crisis mentality. The end result is an anxious public that’s susceptible to ill-conceived, but highly profitable, solutions. Once more, while the apparatchiks sound the alarm about external threats, there are genuine threats emanating from within. America’s Deep State is busy executing campaigns of espionage and sabotage in foreign networks. U.S. intelligence agencies are embroiled in covert operations at home and abroad which have been instrumental in the emergence of a sprawling underground industry that develops weaponized malware and Orwellian mass-interception tools. Proponents explain that these developments are necessary to ensure our “national security.” The reality is that this decidedly offensive approach is seriously undermining our collective security. n November of 2011, a security researcher named Joe Weiss blogged2 about a report released by the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center3 earlier in the month. The report procured by Weiss, titled Public Water District Cyber Intrusion, claimed that a Russian hacker had succeeded in breaching a SCADA system at an unnamed water utility, destroying a water pump by turning the system on and off repeatedly. SCADA is an acronym that stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. SCADA systems are specialized computer installations used to monitor and control equipment in an industrial setting (e.g. in a factory or power plant). A SCADA system typically consists of a central host computer, known as the Master Terminal Unit (MTU), which communicates over a network with a set of field data interface devices, the eyes and ears of the SCADA system (e.g. meters, valve position transmitters). There are a couple of SCADA sub-components that we’ll see again. Specifically, SCADA systems use what are known as Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) to collect data from field data interface devices. SCADA systems also employ Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to automate the operation of field data interface devices. SCADA systems are important because they’re ubiquitous; the operation of our infrastructure depends upon them. This DHS report didn’t provide explicit details in its alert about the nature of the SCADA system that was attacked, or any forensic information (e.g. the system vendor, the attack vector, or the owner of the compromised installation). This did little to prevent Weiss from speculating that a successful attack could pose a threat to our nuclear arsenal.

This did little to prevent Weiss from speculating that a successful attack could pose a threat to our nuclear arsenal. He told reporters: The alleged Russian hacker was actually an engineer named Jim Mimlitz who had been contacted on his cell phone for technical support. At the time of the alleged intrusion, he and his family were on vacation in Russia and so he logged in remotely to lend a hand. The destruction of the water pump was completely unrelated. As Mimlitz explains: The previous story is a typical example of the kind of overblown rhetoric that has been embodied by a series of metaphors which have appeared in public debate over the past few years. We’ll spend much of this chapter looking at a few of these metaphors. The associated hyperbole is dangerous because it strikes a raw nerve in the psychic lattice. With homage to Charles Mackay, it elicits the madness of crowds. Every American depends – directly or indirectly – on our system of information networks. They are increasingly the backbone of our economy and our infrastructure; our national security and our personal well-being. But it’s no secret that terrorists could use our computer networks to deal us a crippling blow.7 In a future conflict, an adversary unable to match our military supremacy on the battlefield might seek to exploit our computer vulnerabilities here at home. Taking down vital banking systems could trigger a financial crisis. The lack of clean water or functioning hospitals could spark a public health emergency. And as we’ve seen in past blackouts, the loss of electricity can bring businesses, cities and entire regions to a standstill.8 Humans aren’t necessarily rational creatures and they tend to inflate spectacular risks that are rare.10 This is why people are often more scared of flying than they are of driving. When security wonks, or even the President, make intimations about cyber-terrorists fiddling with hardware in nuclear weapons it only exacerbates this pathology. This is despite the fact that the State Department reported that in 2010 fewer than 20 U.S. citizens were killed in incidents of terror11 (as opposed to the 30,196 people who died in automobile accidents in 2010).12 In fact, in terms of raw probability, you’re about as likely to be killed in an act of terrorism as you to be crushed by a heavy piece of furniture.13 Let’s rewind all the way back to the summer of 1991, a little more than a year after Microsoft released Windows 3.0, when front of a congressional subcommittee about the overall state of computer", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:1:b95876e3d4cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3129, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "incidents of terror11 (as opposed to the 30,196 people who died in automobile accidents in 2010).12 In fact, in terms of raw probability, you’re about as likely to be killed in an act of terrorism as you to be crushed by a heavy piece of furniture.13 Let’s rewind all the way back to the summer of 1991, a little more than a year after Microsoft released Windows 3.0, when front of a congressional subcommittee about the overall state of computer security. It was there, in the halls of Capitol Hill, that the Pearl Harbor cyberwar metaphor gained traction. But not everyone accepted this metaphor. For example, in February of 2000, during a photo opportunity with members of the hi-tech industry, then President Bill Clinton ran into the Pearl Harbor metaphor when a nearby reporter asked about a series of high-profile denial of service attacks against Amazon and eBay. Q: Would you entertain one last question, sir? We’ve always heard for the last four or five years that it was going to take an electronic Pearl Harbor – many of the people around this table I’ve interviewed over the last four or five years and they’ve agreed that’s the kind of impact we would need for everybody to play together and work together. Is that what happened last week? The President: Look, it’s a source of concern, but I don’t think we should leave here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave here with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was entirely predictable; it’s part of the price of the success of the Internet; and we’re all determined to work together to meet it. All told, this is a remarkably coherent response, especially when compared to the prominent overstatements that you’ll encounter in this chapter. While Clinton agreed that there was indeed a threat associated with denial of service attacks, he also acknowledged that the corresponding risk wasn’t on the same scale as the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. A closer look at recorded denial of service attacks, like the 2007 incident in Estonia, affirms Clinton’s stance. A Denial of Service (DoS) attack attempts to overwhelm hosts on the Internet by flooding them with client requests. They occur out in the wild when too many people visit the same web site simultaneously. A web server being subjected to an onslaught of web page requests sometimes can’t keep up with the demand being placed on it and falters. It’s like a waiter at a restaurant trying to service too many tables. The worst thing that can happen as the result of a denial of service attack is that the targeted server will go down until the network engineers find a way to address the corresponding bandwidth problem, or the attack lets up.

The damages incurred are almost always limited to lost revenue due to downtime, in addition to the cost of provisioning equipment and services to resume operation. In the pantheon of recorded cyber-attacks, denial of service incidents have resided on the low-impact side of the scale. None of them have involved the transfer, modification, or destruction of data. Contrast the Estonia denial-of-service incident against the attack on Pearl Harbor which killed thousands of Americans, sunk four of our eight battleships, and irrevocably altered the course of world history. Anyone who equates a denial of service attack with Pearl Harbor is engaged in contemptible exaggeration that perverts the type of threat that a denial of service attack usually represents. Yet some people would point to denial of service attacks and liken them to out-and-out military assaults. We see, for example, that Estonia’s computer emergency response team responded to the junk packets with technical aplomb and coolheaded professionalism, while Estonia’s leadership … well, didn’t. Faced with DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] and nationalistic, cross-border hacktivism – nuisances that have plagued the rest of the wired world for the better part of a decade – Estonia’s leaders lost perspective.15 Bombast aside, temporary loss of service doesn’t have to translate into a calamity, particularly when the service provider is prepared in advance. This isn’t an unreasonable expectation, either. Continuity of business measures are standard fare in the enterprise, even if it’s something as simple as pulling out a manual credit card imprinter when point-of-sale terminals go down. It’s also possible to take a denial-of-service attack and magnify the consequences to generate the desired visceral response. For example, in November of 2009, security software vendor McAfee released its 2009 Virtual Criminology Report which was entitled Virtually Here: The Age of Cyber Warfare. 17 The cover of the report displays a stark black and white photo of a nuclear reactor off in the distance. For example, Scott Borg, the director of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit (a think tank), stated that “People were provided with attack tools, targets and timing in the Georgia cyber campaign,” referencing Russian defacement and denial of service attacks against official Georgian websites. These attacks accompanied more traditional warfare during the South Ossetia war. By itself, this allegation isn’t really that disquieting, as DDoS attacks are commonplace.

Specifically, he warns that: In this case, some context might help. Panetta’s remarks on 60 Minutes were made in January of 2012 right, around the same time that President Obama was pushing his vision of a leaner military, which mandated some $487 billion in Defense Budget cuts spread over ten years.19 Per the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Pentagon also faced another $600 billion in cuts over the next ten years if Congress isn’t able to sufficiently reduce federal spending.20 We must protect our critical infrastructure at all costs – from our water to our electricity, to banking, traffic lights and electronic health records…. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the threats we face. Our enemies are real, they are sophisticated, they are determined and they will not rest.22 (6) Paul Kurtz, a Partner and chief operating officer of Good Harbor Consulting as well as a senior advisor to the Obama Transition Team for cybersecurity, recently stated that the United States is unprepared to respond to a ‘‘cyber-Katrina’’ and that ‘‘a massive cyber disruption could have a cascading, long-term impact without adequate co-ordination between government and the private sector.”23 Paul Kurtz is one of many recurring characters in the cyberwar milieu. At the tail end of the 1990s, he was the director for counterterrorism in the National Security Council’s Office of Transnational Threats. In 2003, he was tapped to serve as the senior director for critical infrastructure protection on the White House’s Homeland Security Council. During the Clinton and G.W. Bush administrations he was a member of the National Security Council. That was this guy’s bread and butter: infrastructure protection. n addition to the Pearl Harbor metaphor, another harrowing I World War II allegory has also gained traction. Just check out the July 3, 2010 cover of The Economist, entitled “Cyberwar: The Threat from the Internet.”24 It features an urban cityscape engulfed by a digitized fireball. Very dramatic, but then again, magazine covers are often intended to get our attention and spur our curiosity rather than offer an accurate depiction of reality. Nevertheless, the press cannot resist hinting at a nuclear holocaust. For example, at an industry conference in the summer of 2012, former FBI Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry, representing his new security company CrowdStrike, caught the attention of news outlets when he equated malware with WMDs: In June of 2010, news broke of a worm called Stuxnet which was discovered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:4:456a27155421", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3132, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "covers are often intended to get our attention and spur our curiosity rather than offer an accurate depiction of reality.

In particular, the worm’s malicious payload seemed to be directed precisely at programmable logic controller hardware used in the enrichment of uranium. Over half of the infections were found in Iran (whose enrichment program has drawn considerable condemnation). It wasn’t long before intimations of mass destruction began to stream from various news outlets. One security researcher referred to the malware’s discovery as an Oppenheimer Moment. 26 Russia’s ambassador to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, claimed that malware like Stuxnet could lead to a new Chernobyl. 27 A reporter from Vanity Fair called it the Hiroshima of cyberwar, 28 then farcically added: Reality check: let’s stop for a moment and put things into perspective. The bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima killed over 100,000 people and leveled an entire city. To date, the impact of Stuxnet on Iran’s nuclear program could best be likened to a digital speed bump that has marginally disrupted an enrichment program. Nobody died. he images of the Twin Towers exploding into flames, bodies Tplummeting toward the earth, and billowing clouds of fluttery ash coalesce into a powerful symbol, an archetype of sorts. Given the sheer depth of the imprint that the terror attacks of 9/11 left on our collective unconscious, it was only a matter of time before the event was brandished to describe cyber threats. In December of 2012 former Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Mike McConnell told the Financial Times: We have had our 9/11 warning. Are we going to wait for the cyber equivalent of the collapse of the World Trade Centers? … All of a sudden, the power doesn’t work, there’s no way you can get money, you can’t get out of town, you can’t get online, and banking, as a function to make the world work, starts to not be reliable …29 If I were an attacker and I wanted to do strategic damage to the United States, I would either take the cold of winter or the heat of summer, I probably would sack electric power on the U.S. East Coast, maybe the West Coast, and attempt to cause a cascading effect.

What McConnell fails to acknowledge is that major financial institutions tend to have elaborate disaster recovery plans in place. Production sites are buttressed by hot secondary sites that can resume transaction processing if the primary sites go down. Not to mention that it’s common to maintain a series of remote data backups in fortified vaults. These vaults are sometimes depleted mines that were converted to storage facilities by companies like Iron Mountain in the early years of the Cold War. In other words, destroying a bank’s data and backup data is a pretty tall order. About half a year later, on February 23, 2010, McConnell gave testimony to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Recall that this is the same committee, chaired by Jay Rockefeller, which gave birth to the Cybersecurity Act of 2010. During his testimony McConnell made inferences to cyber terrorism, presaging: Of particular concern is the rise of non-state actors who are motivated not by greed or a cause, but by those with a different world view who wish to destroy the information infrastructure which powers much of the modern world – the electric grid, the global financial system, the electronic health care records, the transportation networks. One aspect of this op-ed that stands out is that McConnell presents what he believes to be the answer to the problem of cyberwar. Specifically, he suggests that the United States could deal with cyberwar by turning to the Cold War strategy of deterrence. In other words, we could use the threat of massive retaliation to discourage other countries from attacking us; our adversaries would know that a cyber-attack on the United States would be met with an overwhelming and cataclysmic response. The attraction of this approach is obvious given our Cold War history and the fall of the Soviet Union. The thinking goes that if it worked back then to prevent open aggression against NATO allies, perhaps it will also work now. However, there are reasons why the strategy of deterrence isn’t as conceptually clean with regard to cyber-attacks, reasons that have to do with the basic assumptions of the deterrence doctrine and the nature of the Internet. We’ll spend a significant amount of bandwidth in this book looking at these ideas in later chapters. The metaphors we’ve seen so far contrast sharply against the conto the rule.

In other words, Schmidt’s gotten his hands dirty in the trenches. In the aftermath of 9/11 President Bush put him on the Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and he was also named as the special adviser for cyberspace security. In 2009, President Obama appointed him as the top computer security advisor for the White House. Once more, there are high-level people in the energy industry who agree with him. At the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit in May of 2013, Gerry Cauley, the chief executive of the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC, a national organization of U.S. electrical grid operators) told a reporter that there has never been a destructive cyber-attack on the grid32 and that he was more concerned about physical threats (e.g. a small group armed with explosives) than he was about cyber threats. This mindset would appear to be justified. For example, in the fall of 2013 there was a series of physical attacks against the power grid in Arkansas. In one incident someone stole a tractor and used it to take down two power line poles.33 Police later arrested a self-employed pool maintenance worker in connection with the crimes.34 This should give one pause. What these dissenting opinions demonstrate, if anything, is that there’s something fishy going on. A multitude of alleged experts have told us that we’re beset on all sides by state-sponsored hackers who plan to destroy our infrastructure and send us whimpering back to the dark ages. But the President’s chosen advisor, the head of NERC, and industry executives say otherwise. he metaphors that we’ve examined in this chapter also serve as a backdrop against which to understand the general environment in which Cybersecurity policy has been developed over the past decade. Obviously our leaders felt pressure, from a number of sources, to take action and they did. Looking at the measures they implemented, as well as the measures that they didn’t implement, is instructive. During the final days of the G.W. Bush administration, in January of 2008, President Bush launched the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) in an effort to shore up the defenses of government networks.

This initiative was started, at least in part, on behalf of the sort of doomsday scenarios this chapter has focused on. Former special adviser Richard Clarke describes the event that got the ball rolling: The President’s scheduler had booked an hour for the decision briefing. It took five minutes. Bush never saw a covert-action proposal he didn’t like. Now, with fifty-five minutes left in the meeting, the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, saw an opening. All the right people were in the room, senior national security cabinet members. McConnell asked if he could discuss a threat to the financial industry and the U. S. Economy. Given the floor, he talked about cyber war and how vulnerable we were to it. Particularly vulnerable was the financial sector, which would not know how to recover from a data-shredding attack, an attack that could do unimaginable damage to the economy. Stunned, Bush turned to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who agreed with the assessment. The $50 billion CNCI program was established by a classified presidential order, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23, so details were initially difficult to come by. However, in October of 2008 the Bush administration started revealing pieces of information. For example, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed a component of the initiative that’s known as the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) program which aimed to decrease the number of links between federal networks and external private sector networks to fewer than 100. The motivating idea behind this scheme was that it would be easier for the government to detect incidents if there were fewer connections to watch. The TIC program stipulates that network gateways to government networks must be monitored by an intrusion detection system developed by the Department of Homeland Security called Einstein. Early incarnations of the system focused on inspecting network traffic and firing off alerts when a suspicious connection was observed. The more recent version of the system currently being developed (i.e. Einstein 3) implements intrusion prevention functionality that not only identifies security events but also acts to block them at runtime. Despite the Bush administration’s inclination towards secrecy, one aspect of CNCI was patently clear; this executive mandate was only concerned with government networks. That is, networks residing within the .mil, .gov, and .ic Internet domains. The private sector was on its own, as far as security was concerned. There’s a certain degree of irony with this fact.

As President, I’ll make cyber-security the top priority that it should be in the 21st century. I’ll declare our cyber-infrastructure a strategic asset, and appoint a National Cyber Advisor who will report directly to me. We’ll coordinate efforts across the federal government, implement a truly national cyber-security policy, and tighten standards to secure information – from the networks that power the federal government, to the networks that you use in your personal lives. It was CNCI redux. It also had a military Cyber Command, but not a cyber war strategy, not a major policy or program to defend the private sector, nothing to initiate international dialogue on cyber war. And, déjà vu all over again, the new Democratic President went out of his way to take [private sector] regulation off the table …40 In June of 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ordered the creation of the United States Cyber Command (CYBERCOM). CYBERCOM was created to “direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks.” In other words, this new organization would oversee the day-to-day protection of military networks (e.g. military networks, or .mil). Non-military government networks, (e.g. or.gov), remained the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. The idea behind CYBERCOM was to integrate existing resources spread out over different branches of the military (e.g. the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force), to coordinate them centrally. This makes sense if you consider that there are some 15,000 military networks spread out over 4,000 military bases in 88 countries.41 As one official told Wired Magazine: Headquartered at Fort Meade, next door to the National Security Agency (NSA), CYBERCOM was originally staffed by approximately 1,000 troops, most of who were transferred over from other positions.43 In January of 2013, the Pentagon announced that this force would expand to 4,900 personnel44 and receive an additional investment of $23 billion.45 Defense contractors definitely see this as a growth industry and not without good reason. For example, in July of 2013, the Navy awarded contracts to 13 companies, worth as much as $899.5 million, for services related to cyber operations. The list of selected contractors included Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and SAIC.46 Running an operation like CYBERCOM would require a level of technical sophistication.

The list of selected contractors included Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and SAIC.46 Running an operation like CYBERCOM would require a level of technical sophistication. So it is only natural that when the decision makers were searching for someone to run CYBERCOM, all they had to do was turn towards Fort Meade, to one of the largest consumers of computer hardware in the world: the NSA. In particular, they considered Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, to be the ideal candidate. In May of 2010 he was promoted to the rank of general and assumed command of CYBERCOM. It’s interesting to note that Alexander retained his position at the NSA. So, while the NSA and CYBERCOM are distinct entities on paper, they’re joined at the top. It would be naive to think that this doesn’t influence the interaction of the two organizations. One entity identifies threats and the other develops strategies to deal with them. Alexander, like many other officials mentioned in this chapter, has demonstrated the ability to mischaracterize threats. In September of 2011, Alexander warned of what could happen as a result of a cyber-attack by referring to a power outage back in the summer of 2003 that impacted millions of people in the Northeast and Midwestern U.S. The outage, which was the second largest in history, was caused by a power line in Ohio that came in contact with nearby trees, resulting in a cascading failure that knocked more than 100 power plants offline.47 But what does a temporary power outage have to do with cyberwar? In this case Gen. Alexander was trying to link a natural disaster with a hypothetical cyber-attack. This connection is preposterous on its face value; it’s an attempt to breathe life into a hypothetical idea using an existing image. You can bet that if a concrete example existed, he would have used it. Put another way, he was signaling that this was an area that would receive an infusion of federal money, creating a growth market for the defense contractors. The publication of the 60-day review of cyber-security policy could thus be interpreted a preliminary indicator that concrete action was going to follow. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic – as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.

The unclassified version of this document didn’t touch on the specifics of responding to cyber-attacks (e.g. what constitutes “use of force,” thresholds for a military response, or the rules of engagement). In fact, it didn’t even provide the sort of broad brush strokes that the Obama administration provided in its policy paper. Though in a speech that outlined the Pentagon’s strategy on the day of its publication, Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn specified: the militarization of cyber,”51 there may be offensive aspects of the program that are being downplayed. Keep in mind that CYBERCOM is subordinate to the United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the successor to the Cold War’s Strategic Air Command, which is in charge of global strike operations as well as strategic deterrence (i.e. the country’s nuclear arsenal). The commander of STRATCOM at the time of CYBERCOM’s establishment, General Patrick Chilton, openly stated: In light of this comment, is it unreasonable to assume that CY-BERCOM may actually at times assume an aggressive posture? Strictly speaking, CYBERCOM was created to “consolidate and streamline Department of Defense capabilities into a single command.”53 Given STRATCOM’s global strike mission, and a mindset that leaves “all options on the table,” could some of CYBERCOM’s capabilities be offensive? In time these questions were answered conclusively. In mid-October of 2012, President Obama signed a classified directive known as Presidential Policy Directive 20, which we’ll look at in more detail later on in this chapter. It explicitly mentioned the use of offensive measures.54 Right around this same time period, in an act that probably signaled this executive action, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta publicly claimed that pre-emptive action was necessary: “National mission forces” to protect computer systems that undergird electrical grids, power plants and other infrastructure deemed critical to national and economic security; “combat mission forces” to help commanders abroad plan and execute attacks or other offensive operations; and “cyber protection forces” to fortify the Defense Department’s networks.56 So, here we are: after years of couching their language strictly in terms of defense, the Pentagon concedes (to itself at least, in classified internal communication) that it will be engaged in offensive actions.

But anyone who followed the outbreak of Stuxnet in 2010 could have told you that the United States is one of the Internet’s more prolific actors. The actual stance of the United States is reflected in its flourishing arms industry. It’s only expected that the United States would be a pioneer in the development of high-grade malware, as the United States is the world’s leading arms manufacturer. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), arms sales by U.S.-based arms manufacturers amounted to over half of the total arms sales.58 To be more precise, in 2011 the United States completed $66 billion in arms exports deals. This is practically 80 percent of the global market. Despite the malaise that’s gripped the national economy, the United States is witnessing record-breaking profits with regard to weapons sales.59 Not to mention that the contractors that constitute much of the defense industry (e.g. Raytheon, Booz Allen, SAIC, Lockheed, etc.) have been openly recruiting engineers to develop offensive tools.60 These signs indicate that the United States sponsors extensive malware development programs.61 On July 12, 2010, the world got a glimpse of one such program. A security researcher, Sergey Ulasen at VirusBlokAda, an antivirus software vendor in Belarus, posted a message at an online forum about a malware sample that he and his coworkers had come across.62 Shortly after Sergey’s initial posting, on this same Internet message board, a German security researcher named Frank Boldewin noticed that the malware contained references to industrial control system (ICS) software developed by Siemens (i.e., SIMATIC WinCC/Step 7) that talks to programmable logic controllers (PLCs). PLCs are special-purpose embedded hardware systems used to automate the operation of machinery. They’re common in manufacturing environments. As the investigation progressed, the captured malware was christened Stuxnet, a name that arises from text strings that were unearthed from the worm’s executable files.63 VirusBlokAda published a full report on Stuxnet which provided some initial details.64 For example, they found that the worm used a zero-day exploit (an unpatched software bug) to propagate itself. Specifically, it leveraged a flaw in the way that Windows Explorer handles file shortcuts (i.e. .LNK files) such that a machine would be compromised if a user plugged in an infected USB drive or opened an infected Windows network file share.65 Now that’s something, isn’t it? A nontrivial software flaw which enabled a newsworthy cyber-attack was virtually ignored by the vendor. For almost two years it languished as an un-patched bug.

A nontrivial software flaw which enabled a newsworthy cyber-attack was virtually ignored by the vendor. For almost two years it languished as an un-patched bug. How many other such bugs exist and have simply been pushed to the wayside? Was this sheer incompetence on the part of Microsoft or something else? Later on in the book we’ll uncover a partial answer. The process of infection, as studied by VirusBlokAda, installs a couple of drivers which were digitally signed by Realtek Semiconductor (a legitimate hardware manufacturer based in Taiwan). This is remarkable because digitally signed drivers, especially those signed by well-known corporate entities like Realtek, are generally assumed to be valid. It’s like an official document embossed with a royal seal. A malicious driver sporting a digital signature like this garners the sort of implicit trust that would make it easy for Stuxnet to spread. Within days of Ulasen’s post, on July 16^(th) Versign revoked the Realtek certificate used to sign the drivers. The attackers responded quickly by switching to a digital signature based on a certificate issued to another Taiwan company, JMicron Technology Corp. Again, on July 22^(nd) , VeriSign revoked JMicron’s certificate. The attackers did not switch to a third digital signature. As events unfolded, researchers at Symantec also took a closer look at Stuxnet. What they discovered was that the worm didn’t rely on just a single zero-day exploit. Stuxnet actually wielded four different exploits based on unpatched flaws in the Windows operating system. Symantec’s Liam ÓMurchu commented: A closer look at the internals of Stuxnet reveals an intricate set of dance steps. Once Stuxnet has compromised a machine, it looks to see if the machine is connected to a Siemens S7 PLC.69 If an S7 PLC is present, Stuxnet checks for the presence of certain physical devices connected to a PLC. In particular, it seeks out an unusual configuration of frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon PLC of Finland and Iranian company Fararo Paya. Frequency converter drives are used to control the rotational speed of attached electric motors. For instance, the drives could be used to regulate the operation of gas centrifuges … which is valuable for organizations trying to enrich uranium. If Stuxnet doesn’t find what it’s looking for, it does nothing. However, if the setup of the hardware being examined matches the targeted fingerprint, Stuxnet will alter the frequency converter drive parameters to sabotage the attached centrifuges. At the same time, in a particularly devious move, Stuxnet feeds bogus status information to the user so that they are unaware of the modification (e.g. the world’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:13:00331e44d907", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3141, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "the operation of gas centrifuges … which is valuable for organizations trying to enrich uranium.

At the same time, in a particularly devious move, Stuxnet feeds bogus status information to the user so that they are unaware of the modification (e.g. the world’s first known PLC rootkit).70 There were a number of thought-provoking forensic artifacts that Stuxnet left on the systems that it infected. For example, Stuxnet set a value in the Windows registry to the number “19790509” as a way to signal that a machine had already been infected. In Symantec’s Stuxnet dossier, investigators speculated that it may represent May 9, 1979, the day that a leading figure of the Iranian Jewish community was executed. Then again, to highlight the somewhat arbitrary nature of this interpretation, CNET columnist Elinor Mills also noted this is also the day that one of the Unabomber’s explosives injured a student at Northwestern University.71 Anyone who works with Microsoft’s Visual Studio will recognize this as the file path corresponding to an executable file named guava that’s been compiled to run on 32-bit Intel hardware and located inside of a Visual Studio project named myrtus. The naming scheme would seem to make some sense to someone acquainted with botany as a guava is a plant in the myrtle family genus psidium. The myrtus genus also resides under the myrtle family. Ralph Langner is a German engineer who specializes in the area of control systems. He runs a boutique consulting firm out of Hamburg. In early September of 2010 he Googled words like “Hebrew” and “Myrtus” and hypothesized that Stuxnet might be a gambit to sabotage the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, which had recently suffered from unexplained setbacks.73 WikiLeaks would not normally mention such an incident without additional confirmation, however according to Iranian media and the BBC, today the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, has resigned under mysterious circumstances. According to these reports, the resignation was tendered around 20 days ago.77 Hooking operating system routines to undermine their functionality is an age-old trick that’s been around for more than a decade. It’s analogous to altering a movie by splicing in one’s own footage. Intercepting routines, via hooking, is easy to implement and even easier to detect. With regard to modifying system logic, there are far more subtle and inconspicuous techniques available for discriminating engineers.79 We wouldn’t expect professional-level malware architects to rely on function hooking. In addition, the fact that the authors of Stuxnet used UPX to armor their binaries is another dead giveaway. UPX is what’s known as a packer.

It compresses files so that they’re difficult to examine and recognize. Any malware author worth their salt would have the good sense to build a custom packing gear, as all of the well-known packing tools have been studied to death. Instead, the authors of The notion that Stuxnet was the result of a scheme involving both Israel and the United States was a popular one. A report supporting the theory about Stuxnet being developed by Israel and the United States was published by the New York Times in early 2011. The authors cited unnamed sources who claimed that the Israelis had even gone so far as to set up a test lab out in the Negev desert using the same equipment that the Iranians possessed.80 Another surprising aspect of Stuxnet is its development was kept so highly compartmentalized. The right hand of U.S. intelligence didn’t know what they left hand was doing. How else could you explain the fact that the Department of Homeland Security and the Idaho National Laboratory established a lab with control system equipment, devoting significant resources towards reverse engineering the worm?87 By analyzing traffic to C2 servers in Malaysia and Denmark, Symantec determined that Stuxnet infected roughly 100,000 hosts spread out over 155 countries.88 The problem with this data is that it doesn’t necessarily indicate the extent of the damage done because the worm seeks out a very specific system fingerprint before executing its destructive payload. On October of 2010, Siemens indicated that only fifteen of its customers had actually been affected by the malware.89 Even then, that doesn’t tell us much about what happened in Iran. Although Stuxnet appears to be designed to destroy centrifuges at the Natanz facility, destruction was by no means total. Moreover, Stuxnet did not lower the production of LEU [low enriched uranium] during 2010. LEU quantities could have certainly been greater, and Stuxnet could be an important part of the reason why they did not increase significantly. Nonetheless, there remain important questions about why Stuxnet destroyed only 1,000 centrifuges. One observation is that it may be harder to destroy centrifuges by use of cyber attacks than often believed.91 Thus, while Stuxnet destroyed 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges (there were approximately 9,000 total at Natanz) it didn’t seem to alter the production of enriched uranium. All told, it would appear that the Stuxnet campaign, if it was truly directed at Iran, was less successful than intended.92 In fact, Stuxnet seems to be far more capable", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:15:3985699e7834", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3143, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "about why Stuxnet destroyed only 1,000 centrifuges.

Jeffrey Carr, the chief executive of security firm Taia Global, remarked: On October 14, 2011, the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics notified Symantec that they had identified a malware sample that looked very similar to Stuxnet. The researchers at CrySys called this new malware sample DuQu (pronounced dyü- kyü) as it creates files whose named begin with the string “~dq.” Unlike Stuxnet, DuQu wasn’t a worm; it didn’t self-replicate. Instead, it was Trojan-packaged inside of a malicious Microsoft Word file.95 The attack vector consisted of a zero-day exploit that targeted a specific bug (i.e. CVE-2011-3402) in the Windows Kernel that handled TrueType font parsing.96 In November Microsoft released an advisory that offered a workaround to address the bug,97 though it wasn’t until December 2011 that Microsoft released a security update.98 While DuQu had a limited shelf-life (i.e. 30 days before selfdestructing, by default), as did Stuxnet, Symantec claimed that infections had been confirmed in six unnamed organizations spread across eight different countries.99 Symantec also asserted that the developers who created DuQu had access to the source code used to build Stuxnet (not just the raw, compiled, binaries).100 These basic conclusions were echoed by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who speculated that there were at most a couple of dozen infections worldwide.101 Another distinguishing feature of DuQu is that it didn’t contain code that targeted ICS installations. Instead, its primary payload was a RAT (Remote Administration Tool), leading investigators to conclude that DuQu was designed to perform network reconnaissance and collect information. To this end, DuQu utilized a digitally signed driver. One variant of DuQu used a driver that was digitally signed by a certificate belonging to C-Media Electronics Incorporated, a company based in Taiwan.102 In December of 2011, researchers at Kaspersky Lab concluded that the drivers used by Stuxnet and DuQu were too similar for it to be a mere coincidence. They hypothesized that the two deliverables were created using a common source code framework, referred to as Tilded (pronounced tilde-deed) as it displays a tendency towards file names that begin with “~d.”103 In May of 2012, Kaspersky Labs announced that it had found an interesting malware specimen while investigating an incident on behalf of UN’s International Telecommunication Union.

An early analysis of the malware had also been performed by researchers in the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.104 What the investigators found was an extensible malware framework, the software equivalent of a multi-purpose Swiss army knife, which implemented a broad range of features using an interchangeable collection of pluggable modules. Each module implements a subset of related features so that modules can be mixed and matched to come up with the right mixture of functionality. As a side note, this module-based approach is remarkably similar to that employed by the Metasploit’s Meterpreter payload.105 The researchers at Kaspersky named the malware framework after a specific module referred to as Flame, a component that’s used to scout out new host machines and infect them.106 Taken as a whole, the base malware install and all of its extension modules tip the scales at 20 MB , which is whale-sized as far as most worms and viruses are concerned. Then again, given the sheer number of operations that the software supported (data compression, data encryption, data deletion, keystroke logging, screen capturing, Bluetooth connectivity, Secure Shell connectivity, database client components, a built-in virtual machine, etc.) this isn’t necessarily a surprise. Flame is so large and includes so many bells and whistles that it almost resembles some sort of commercial enterprise application. Hence, it makes sense that Flame didn’t implement any rootkit features. Instead, it hid in plain sight. This turned out to be a successful strategy, as the malware evaded detection for several This is a significant statement. A big name in the anti-virus industry has openly admitted that they’re outgunned! Of course, this isn’t news for the developers who create malware. In fact, beating anti-virus software is de rigueur. It’s a task that is easily within reach of the average computer science undergraduate.109 George Ledin, a professor who teaches a course on malware development, lamented: The AV [anti-virus] business is, unfortunately, a bizarre combination of janitorial service (“spill in aisle 8^(′′) ) and insurance (but without accident, comprehensive, or liability coverage). It’s a sweet business to be in. That’s why we have some fifty companies offering this kind of fake “protection.” Initially, investigators didn’t see a technical connection between Flame and the Tilded platform (which provides the base architecture for both Stuxnet and DuQu).

Then, researchers at Kaspersky realized that an encrypted DLL used by an early variant of Stuxnet was almost identical to a module used by Flame. They were so similar that it’s believed that they were derived from the same source code.110 Then there’s the matter of forged Microsoft certificates, which allowed Flame to intercept Windows update traffic and spread itself by pretending to be a legitimate operating system update. The engineers who developed flame were able to generate a legitimate code-signing certificate, one that linked to Microsoft’s official root digital certificate, by re-purposing a certificate normally used for Terminal Services (i.e. remote desktop) licensing.111 Doing so involved identifying weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used to create these certificates and then finding enough computing power to exploit the weaknesses.112 This evidence corroborates an article published by the Washington Post, in which unnamed U.S. officials asserted that Flame had been developed jointly by the United States and Israel in an effort to scout out Iran’s networks and lay the groundwork for the Stuxnet attack.113 Conversely both U.S. and Israeli officials have loudly denied involvement.114 Furthermore, while the assumed target of the attacks is the Iranian nuclear program, one blogger has implied that other motives may also be at play: My source also tells me that this is the first known instance in which Israeli intelligence has used malware to intrude on Israeli citizens. Within Israel and the Palestinian territories Flame is implemented by the Shin Bet. The “beauty” of it for the secret police is that unlike “legal” eavesdropping on phones or computers, you don’t need to ask for judicial approval to infect a computer. 115 Based on the results of a detailed analysis of Flame, we continued to actively search for new, unknown components. A more in-depth analysis conducted in June 2012 resulted in the discovery of a new, previously unknown malware platform that uses a modular structure resembling that of Flame, a similar code base and system for communicating to C&C servers, as well as numerous other similarities to Flame. What we’ve seen so far is a widespread and intricate series of interrelated malware frameworks that researchers believe to be linked at the source code level (see Figure 1-1).

Rather, they see deep structural commonalities that can only be achieved by having access to the original blueprints, the source code, of the platforms in question. Both Stuxnet and DuQu appear to be based on the Tilded platform, which is in turn related to the Flame platform with its Gauss and miniFlame offshoots. Given that United States officials have leaked involvement in designing and deploying Stuxnet, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the U.S. government is running an extensive offensive software program. Projects Agency (DARPA) is working on a program called Plan X. The goal of this program is to take cyber-attacks, which are currently run as special-purpose operations using a small group of highly-skilled specialists, and industrialize the process so that cyber-attacks can be launched reliably en masse, in a predictable manner, without all of the setup effort. A DARPA announcement on Plan X refers to this as “automatically constructing verifiable and quantifiable cyber operations.” This means focusing on: Developing high-level mission plans and automatically synthesizing a mission script that is executed through a humanon-the-loop interface, similar to the auto-pilot function in modern aircraft. This process will leverage formal methods to provably quantify the potential battle damage from each synthesized mission plan.118 While Stuxnet and Plan X are strong indicators that the DoD isn’t limiting itself to defensive actions in cyberspace, they’re still not entirely conclusive. Definitive evidence, which directly confirms the existence of an offensive cyber program, appeared in June of 2013. This is when a former CIA operative turned whistleblower named Edward Snowden leaked a top-secret document to Glenn Greenwald at the Guardian. The leaked document, Presidential Policy Directive 20, 119 was issued in October of 2012. Page 9 of this document touches on Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO): In other words, Obama explicitly told the Pentagon to draw up a list of targets for cyber-attacks which would serve “U.S. national objectives around the world.” As far as our leaders are concerned, they’re not limited to merely using offensive tools for retaliation. They believe that attacks can be used proactively when it serves their purposes. Confidential sources cited by Foreign Policy magazine also point to the NSA’s Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO), which has run rampant through Chinese networks for the past 15 years.121 TAO is a unit that includes some 600 hackers who work in rotating shifts 24 hours a day all year round, infiltrating foreign computers to extract political, military, and economic data.

TAO is also tasked with performing reconnaissance on behalf of cyber-attacks executed by CYBERCOM. Top-secret documents examined by the Washington Post show that the TAO program is involved in a larger $625 million, 1,870 person, effort code-named GENIE which is geared towards subverting entire foreign networks. By 2011, the GENIE campaign succeeded in compromising nearly 69,000 devices on the Internet and loading them with “implants,” allowing the devices to be surreptitiously controlled. Foreign Policy magazine puts TAO’s 12-year total for the number of devices it’s compromised at over 80,000.122 The NSA unit’s software engineers would rather tap into networks than individual computers because there are usually many devices on each network. Tailored Access Operations has software templates to break into common brands and models of “routers, switches and firewalls from multiple product vendor lines,” according to one document describing its work.123 The NSA seems to have perfected what’s known as the Man in the Middle (MITM) attack, where data from a hacked network device is temporarily redirected to the NSA before being routed back to the original destination.124 This allows the NSA to archive and decrypt the corresponding network traffic without altering the targets under surveillance. On at least one occasion it appears that the NSA has impersonated Google to execute a MITM attack (which implies that there may be some private sector collaboration).125 ou may recall a scene from the Wizard of Oz, where Dorothy and her cohorts were advised to “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.” To understand what’s driving these Hollywood disaster movie screenplays, you’ve got to recognize that the creation of CNCI and CYBERCOM weren’t spontaneous events. They didn’t just appear out of thin air. Rather, there are discernible forces at play. For years we have been told that an existential menace was looming on the horizon, a prophecy of the end times heralded by a long stream of government legislators, retired bureaucrats, generals, and security wonks. There’s a Cyber Cold War taking place they say126, and as in our earlier Cold War the United States is living under the perpetual threat of doomsday.

Once a month you show up at a designated government office to pick up commodity stamps which indicate how many pounds of rice, ounces of oil, yards of cloth, and other essentials have been allocated to you. The officials at this government office carefully check your resident permit, which is logged at a central registrar’s office. This was how things worked in China roughly 30 years ago under what’s known as the Hukou (resident permit) and Liangpiao (rationing stamps) systems. With the institution of these exacting social controls, people couldn’t freely move, as ration coupons were only issued at the government office where their resident permit was registered. If China had remained this way, the recent flurry of cyber-attacks attributed to China would have to have been singularly masterminded by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government. No one else, and no other organization, would have the freedom to engage in illegal activity on a local scale, let alone on a global scale. The populace, immobilized by policies like Hukou and Liangpiao, would be subject to extensive neighborhood watch systems, such that the government could quickly track down criminals and squash illegal behavior.

Many of these workers are referred to as “the floating population,” as employment tended to shift geographically over time. With the Liangpiao system’s demise in 1993, Hukou became increasingly inaccurate; for the first time in Communist history, the State suddenly didn’t know the location of each citizen. As the security apparatus lost its former efficacy, a criminal element emerged. China’s leadership initiated the country’s economic ascent by throwing off the shackles of Maoist egalitarianism, asserting that they needed “to let some people get rich first.”2 The practical consequence was a widening chasm between the very rich and everybody else. Prominent VIPs began to show off their wealth with sports cars and high fashion. Behind all of the celebratory glitz is a pervasive, murky, backdrop of venality. The alleged crimes of Communist official Bo Xilai and his associates (e.g. bribery, racketeering, offshore gambling, and even murder) do not at all come as a surprise to the locals.3 By the time the trial concluded in September 2013, the judge said Bo’s embezzlement and bribery was over $4 million.4 One particular instance that came to light was a $100, 000 trip to Africa taken by Bo’s son and his friends. Most Chinese assume a priori that their leaders enjoy special treatments. It is common knowledge that even the strictest rules have wide latitude of interpretation if the perpetrator happens to be someone powerful. To be fair, in light of the 2008 economic collapse in the United States, this is hardly a phenomenon unique to China alone.5 age price of houses in Beijing is 1.7 million yuan (about $250, 000 .8 This means that a starting college graduate in Beijing worries about housing prospects in the same way that a part-time waiter does in Denver. The financial pressure on normal citizens to manage the basics of life (e.g. a house, marriage, children, taking care of ailing parents, health care) is practically overwhelming. This is exactly this sort of income inequality that stimulates crime. The rich thrive by forging allegiances with allies in the government. The poor get a piece of the action with the tacit guarantee that the law will look the other way.

Informal arrangements between bounty hunters, corrupt politicians, and greedy corporate interests are the general rule… not organized armies. The idea that cyber-attacks from China are part of an all-encompassing campaign by the Chinese government is what psychologists call out-group homogeneity bias. It’s human nature for the American public to ignore the nuances of social dynamics in a foreign country like China but at the same time recognize the variability in the United States. In reality each country has its own intricate framework of moving parts, especially a country as vast as China. Though it suits the Pentagon quite well to ceaselessly point to the East and leverage our innate tendency to see one great big united hoard of Chinese hackers. There are also foreigners in China who are believed to be engaged in organized criminal activity. Officials have admitted that there is a lack of oversight of this population.10 Beijing, for instance, has about 200,000 foreigners and the government only has adequate records on 721 of them, people who hold Chinese green cards. The remaining foreigners are cause for concern. All told, there are a lot of different criminal operators in China, people who have the motivation, means, and opportunity to commit cyber-attacks. A given attack originating from China could be the work of a cash-strapped outlaw trying to get ahead, a well-funded organized crime syndicate, a high-ranking party official sponsoring an operation for his own personal gain, an opportunistic foreign visitor with money to burn, or a state-sponsored government agent from another country running a false-flag campaign from a launch pad within the PRC. If you want to do business with the Chinese, it’s generally less risky to do so in Hong Kong because there are a significant number of checks and balances in place to safeguard buyers and sellers. In fact, it’s fairly common for merchants from the mainland to travel to Hong Kong for this very reason. Simply put, there’s better supervision and less room for monkey business. If someone tries to rip you off, there are business associations and government authorities that you can go to. In Hong Kong there’s rule of law with little deviation. In contrast, with regard to law and order, mainland China is in a state of disarray.

Based on his work on abortion cases in China as well as his firsthand experience on the infringement of his own human rights, this selftaught lawyer asserts: The economic and political reforms that began in China during the years of Deng Xiaoping transferred power to local officials and resulted in extensive abuse. In fact, outside observers question the extent to which the central leadership can exercise their authority to reform their system and impose rule of law.12 Such were the primary conclusions of He Qinglian in her celebrated book The Pitfalls of Modernization.13 To get an idea for how bad things have gotten, mainland China (PRC) is becoming a popular haven for white collar fugitives from Taiwan.14 Although most outlaws disappear into the nation’s teeming masses, some of the more prominent fugitives have been brazen enough to open businesses and start new careers. For example, a businessman named Chen Youhao was charged with stealing about 800 million New Taiwan dollars from a subsidiary of the Tuntex Group in Taiwan. He subsequently escaped to the mainland and established one of the top ten businesses in a city named Xiamen. With economic development came the Internet and the online economy. These developments pose additional challenges to the ailing rule of law. “China’s networks are wide open” concluded Dillon Beresford, a researcher from NSS Labs who spent the better part of 18 months navigating his way through the far reaches of The amount of data I have found that is not intended for public consumption is amazing. I stopped after three terabytes. These systems are not maintained and are all vulnerable to attacks… They don’t have the manpower or even the knowledge to maintain them. And, in many ways, China is still playing catch up with the U.S. They’re an aggressor in cyberspace, but their own networks are very weak and poorly designed.15 Even more, many believe that China’s systems are more vulnerable than are America’s. This assertion has merit, in part because greater use of “pirated” software by Chinese companies and institutions means that their systems typical do not get the same upgrades of protection to evolving cyber threats that nominal buyers receive.17 In 2010, China’s National Computer Network Emergency Response Team (CNCERT) reported that over ten million machines alone were compromised by Trojan software and that these machines were being managed by almost half a million command-and-control (C&C) servers.

Nevertheless, at the end of 2010 the Ministry of Public Security admitted that they had only arrested 460 people on hacking charges.18 Take a moment to digest this fact and put it into context. China is a nation with more than a billion people. A sprawling city of several million is seen as a “town.” There are thousands of cyber outlaws, and that’s probably an understatement. This is a nation that is admittedly unable to effectively rein in tax evasion.19 Something as essential as collecting taxes (an activity that offers direct and concrete benefits to the government) eludes China thanks to pervasive bribery and a dysfunctional bureaucracy. The government can’t even handle tasks that are definitely in its best interests. To understand the depth of the problem, consider that there’s a vast underground market in China for fake receipts, despite the fact that the crime is sometimes punishable by death.20 Never mind the staggering amount of air pollution,21 which is so bad that wearing a mask is practically mandatory, or the fact that Chinese parents have so little faith in the quality of local products that the number of arrests for smuggling baby formula at the border with Hong Kong has exceeded the number of arrests for heroin smuggling.22 Let’s not forget the new ID system. Starting in 2005, China deployed a new generation of digital ID cards. Unfortunately, in contrast to their western counterparts, the designers failed to implement a disabling feature, such that cards can’t be canceled in the event of theft or loss. Hence, the new ID cards are prized processions for criminals. Today, genuine ID cards are a booming business online, sorted by age, sex and other physical attributes, at a price tag of about $65 each.23 China is not an expanding imperial power bent on hegemony. Rather, China is a country that’s struggling simply to function, much less function properly. This is a consequence of systemic corruption which prevents the government from competently delivering necessary services. As a testimony to this, the number of protests in China doubled between 2006 and 2010, peaking at 180,000 recorded “mass incidents.”24 Given the non-stop array of gaffes, how could you expect the PRC leaders to effectively deal with outlaws on their stretch of the Internet? Corruption is so ubiquitous, and rule of law is often so tenuous, that China is fertile ground for criminal activity.

If you ever wondered why there are so many servers in China that host criminal activity, now you know why.25 Despite what the military types may say, what goes on in China is not necessarily the result of some grand 1000-year plan on behalf of the PRC’s top leadership, but rather the logical end-result of their waning control and the emergence of rogue elements that have found refuge in the relative disorder of China’s networks. Let me put it to you this way: If an Eastern European intelligence officer were running a covert operation based somewhere in Europe, he or she would be well advised to launch their attacks from China to mislead forensic investigators. Anti-forensics is a blossoming discipline in the field of computer security.26 Elaborate ruses involving forgery, deception, and impersonation are as old as espionage. Any intelligence operator worth his salt will go to great lengths to pivot his attack through another country while making sure to use tools, operational signatures, and planted artifacts that implicated a third-party. It’s a matter of standard tradecraft. The knee-jerk response of everyone in the media, in the military, and in Washington is to reflexively blame the PRC. Not for a single moment do any of the commentators on the nightly news, or alleged experts from the myriad of beltway think tanks, presume to suspect someone else (e.g. corporate-based, state-sponsored, or organized crime). One solution that the PRC is contemplating is to copy the Hong Kong system. This school of thought is embodied by what’s called the Guangdong model, as Hong Kong borders the Mainland province of Guangdong and the two neighbors share a common dialect (Cantonese). The Guangdong model favors liberalization of economic policies coupled with greater political openness, with an emphasis on rule of law based on due process. China’s new leader Xi Jinping is charging ahead in this direction. For example, the availability of transcripts regarding the trial of Bo Xilai is unprecedented. Hardliners in the Communist Party argue that the country is straying from its traditional socialist values, and all it simply needs is a security apparatus that’s on par with China’s economic boom. They point back to the era of Mao, where society was relatively secure because the government knew almost everything about each of its citizens, and then did what was necessary to maintain security. It’s somewhat akin to the authoritarian, J. Edgar Hoover, school of thought.

It’s somewhat akin to the authoritarian, J. Edgar Hoover, school of thought. From this vantage point, due process and individual rights are sacrificed in the name of expediency and results. Bo Xilai, a figurehead of this authoritarian camp, launched brutal crackdowns on organized crime. Because Mr. Bo was the head of the Communist Party in Chongqing region, this alternative model for change has been dubbed the Chongqing model. The fall of Mr. Bo doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the Chongqing movement, as it is stylistically consistent with the Tiananmen Square massacre and Falun Gong persecutions. Without a doubt, this approach still has powerful supporters in the government. Ironically, as Western commentators question the long-term viability of Chongqing model, it’s interesting to note that the J. Edgar Hoover style of safeguarding national security has also seen revival in the U.S. post 9/11. Specifically, we are alluding to the Patriot Act, the 20I2Na⋅ tional Defense Authorization Act, warrantless wiretaps, drone strikes, and the ongoing campaign to entrench government secrecy. What’s different is that the U.S. is a fairly young republic founded on the ideals of freedom. China, on the other hand, is accustomed to authoritarian power structures which have recurred in various forms for thousands of years. In the end, China and the United States suffer from common problems originating from the Internet (e.g. cybercrime, espionage) and both nations have pondered solutions. Though heavy-handed tactics wielded by strong leaders may possess the lure of a simple-sounding cure, it would behoove both countries to focus on imposing rule of law without taking shortcuts that impinge upon individual rights or short-circuit due process. While trying to manage Internet threats, China has recently made gestures towards defending its networks. In July of 2010, more than a year after the formation of CYBERCOM, China announced the creation of its Information Security Base, a department dedicated to tackling cyber war threats. An officer from the Chinese General Staff Headquarters, who requested to remain anonymous, told a reporter from the Global Times: “It is a defensive base for information security, not an offensive headquarters for cyber war.”27 That’s not to say that China hasn’t developed offensive capability. China has almost certainly been working on its offense since 2003, when the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) openly stated that it would be deploying information warfare units.28 Strategists like General Dai Qingmin expounded on the merits of pre-emptive measures in the domain of electronic warfare: Actions such as intelligence warfare, psychological warfare, and campaign deception in advance of combat seem to be even more important to the unimpeded implementation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:27:27c7d14bb573", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3155, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "war.”27 That’s not to say that China hasn’t developed offensive capability.

For this reason, information warfare must be started in advance of other combat actions before making war plans and while making war plans.29 Yet, despite the theoretical emanations of ambitious Chinese generals, it may be that China’s bark is worse than its bite. At least, that’s the opinion of Desmond Ball, a professor in the Strategic and Defense Studies Centre located at the Australian National University. In a 2011 article, he concluded: There is no evidence that China’s cyber-warriors can penetrate highly secure networks or covertly steal or falsify critical data. They would be unable to systematically cripple selected command and control, air defence and intelligence networks and databases of advanced adversaries, or to conduct deception operations by secretly manipulating the data in these networks. The gap between the sophistication of the anti-virus and network security programs available to China’s cyber-war- These conclusions are in stark contrast to the torrent of reports published by the American press. Most cyberwar pieces that find their way to print depict China as technical juggernaut, a horde of ultra-sophisticated invaders which has infiltrated its way into the heart of our information infrastructure and likely installed some sort of system-wide doomsday device. Voices that fail to adhere to this basic message, and its tone, are outnumbered. In early 2013 a computer security vendor, Mandiant Corporation, provided the New York Times with a report on a series of espionage operations that appeared to originate out of China. Mandiant believes that the Chinese military, through an obscure command referred to as Unit 61398, was responsible, and furthermore investigators voiced concern that these attacks were targeting American critical infrastructure.31 Consider this: the United States is China’s largest trading partner such that the Chinese economy depends heavily on American consumers as a source of revenue.32 Likewise, the Chinese own more of our debt, in terms of Treasury securities, than anyone else.33 In fact, they own more than fifteen percent of our total public debt, nothing to sneeze it. Given this level of economic interdependency, all of the various doomsday scenarios begin to lose their hue of legitimacy. If the United States went down in a blaze of cyber glory what would happen to China’s export market? Even worse, how would China recoup the trillion dollar investment it made in Treasury securities? The Chinese would be shooting themselves in the foot if they crippled the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:28:e60265f6c75e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3156, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "own more than fifteen percent of our total public debt, nothing to sneeze it.

The Chinese would be shooting themselves in the foot if they crippled the U.S. It should be patently clear to anyone that it’s in China’s best interest to keep the U.S. economy humming right along. This state of affairs strongly suggests that the likelihood of a mass-scale infrastructure attack by China is about as realistic as a land invasion. n light of their somewhat tenuous grip on their networks, it’s I probably not that far a stretch to conclude that the Chinese are just as worried about us as we seem to be about them (if not more so). In June of 2011, the official newspaper of the Chinese Military, the Liberation Army Daily, stated: The U.S. military is hastening to seize the commanding military heights on the Internet, and another Internet war is being pushed to a stormy peak…. Their actions remind us that to protect the nation’s Internet security, we must accelerate Internet defense development and accelerate steps to make a strong Internet army.36 At the same time, you could invert the names of the two countries and come up with a valid statement. The United States military, facing budget cuts and furloughs,40 claims that America faces an existential threat from China and we need to build up our cyber capabilities. Both militaries point at each other and howl for funding. Such is the nature of a self-perpetuated arms race. Then again, this is what military officers and defense contractors are preoccupied with: war, breaking things and killing people. It’s what they do. Though, they prefer to call it “defense” because it sounds less hostile. Of course if you look for them it’s only expected that you’d unearth hundreds of military publications in both China and the United States that dwell on the vagaries of cyberwar. Cyberwar proponents like to point to military publications as proof that the other side is gunning for us and infer that anyone who thinks otherwise isn’t paying attention (they’ll moan “don’t you see, we’re asleep at the wheel, they’re laughing at us!”).

With respect to federal funding it’s interesting to see how align themselves with broader public concerns. In an annual report on China published in 2013, the Pentagon stated that the Chinese government “appeared” to be siphoning off intellectual property from the United States and that the acquired intelligence could potentially benefit China’s hi-tech industry and threaten the U.S. economy.41 Mike Rogers, the Republican congressman from Michigan who currently chairs the House Intelligence Committee, pulled out all the stops and went flat-out full bore. During a video segment released on CNBC he brazenly stated that cyber-attacks from China are the number one threat to U.S. economic security.43 Could Congressman Rogers (who, by the way, has received a healthy infusion of campaign donations from the likes of Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and SAIC) be correct? Let’s pause for a moment and reflect on this notion. Does Chinese cyber espionage actually represent this sort of existential threat? There are acknowledged experts on this topic, like Norm Matloff at UC Davis, who agree with this conclusion.46 Outsourcing has done significant damage to American workers in addition to yielding crucial strategic assets. The short-term financial interests of the corporate elite are disrupting society’s long-term interests. Smith’s core message, that there are serious economic threats that we’re being distracted from with overstated tales of Chinese cyber-espionage, is not difficult to corroborate. Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas have studied the recent financial crisis and calculated the damage wrought on behalf of banks which have been deemed too big to fail. It’s somewhere on the order of the U.S. annual GDP: Having said that, now take a look at the graph displayed in Figure 2-1. It’s based on data collected by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. It compares average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory employees48 against corporate profits (after taxes).49 For the sake of clarity, data has been indexed at 100 starting on January 1, 2009. The upper echelons of the income scale, people who also happen to hold the bulk of their wealth in the financial markets, are thriving.

Doomsayers prophesize that banks will fail, power grids will black out, and chaos will ensue. Cyberwar in its most severe incarnation is referred to by certain elements in the media as Cyber-Armageddon.2 While the exact odds of this happening have not been quantified, people are being presented with the message that it could happen.3 Once more, rather than focus on the actual likelihood of a Cyber-Armageddon, alleged experts prefer to focus on how horrific the consequences will be. As we mentioned earlier, while it’s possible that you could win a state lottery, it’s not necessarily wise to make personal financial decisions based on the expectation of winning, regardless of how wonderful it would be. One reason this message has been so effective is that authorities and alleged experts have been artfully exploiting the English language. In George Orwell’s 1947 essay Politics and the English Language, he discusses how language can be manipulated to mislead.4 Orwell shows how political control is related to the corruption of language. For instance, he explains how euphuisms can conceal un- Such is the dynamic at work with the term cyberwar, which has been used expansively to refer to a broad range of different security incidents (e.g. espionage, crime, etc.). This conflation of different threats allows the pundits to frame everything that’s happening out on the Internet using the rhetoric of war, thus lending credence to their proposed solutions. In his 2010 Washington Post op-ed piece, former DNI Mike McConnell asserts that the United States is losing a cyberwar. He backs this claim by directing the reader’s attention to Operation Aurora, where a number of high-profile corporations like Google and Adobe were attacked in an effort to access and steal intellectual property. But this wasn’t war. In fact, it sounds a lot more like industrial espionage. Industrial espionage isn’t war; they represent distinct ideas, yet blurry logic allows the concepts to merge, as if to claim that 2 + 2 = 5 . Warfare can be military, or it can be quasi-military, or it can be non-military. It can use violence, or it can be non-violent.

Unrestricted war is everywhere and all the time. In the background we can clearly hear the Inner Party of Oceania chanting their mantra: WAR IS PEACE. Honestly, what kind of formulation would you expect from military leaders in an authoritarian regime that censors the Internet and regularly jails political dissidents? What’s happening is that the meaning of the word war is being expanded to swallow up other words (like espionage, crime, sabotage,. etc.). As Orwell explained, language is being used to corrupt thought. Events which are clearly acts of espionage or crime, and unrelated to any ongoing military hostilities, are being depicted as acts of war because military problems naturally lend themselves to military solutions. It doesn’t matter if terms are confused furtively or if the proponents of cyberwar explicitly advocate switching to more “holistic” (i.e. conflated) definitions of the word “war.” By framing cyber-attacks using the language of war, tacit assumptions come into play that direct our decision makers towards a specific kind of approach to address cyber-attacks. his begs a question: are military solutions the optimal way Tto deal with common problems like crime, espionage, and sabotage? Most functioning societies maintain police departments to deal with lawbreakers and civilian-based security services like the FBI to catch spies.8 The core mission of an army is vastly different from that of domestic law enforcement. Should the military be charged with maintaining law-and-order online? As any doctor or plumber will tell you, effective treatment is based on a correct diagnosis. You don’t begin an aggressive regime of chemotherapy without first confirming that a patient has a form of cancer that will respond to treatment. To move towards constructive solutions that address our cyber-security ailments, we first need to observe and classify the corresponding symptoms. Investigative categories are standard procedure for law enforcement agencies. Whether incident categories are developed to match the divisions of the security apparatus, or the security apparatus has been adapted to incident categories, an incidentresponse table exists. If you visit the FBI’s website on Famous Cases and Criminals, you’ll see this approach at work.9 Investigations are filed under terrorism, organized crime, espionage, public corruption, white collar crime, etc. The most likely explanation for the sudden spate of scare stories is rather more mundane: a turf war between American government agencies over who should oversee the nation’s cyber-security.

In one corner is the Department of Homeland Security, which operates the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), a body set up to co-ordinate America’s various cybersecurity efforts. In the other corner is the National Security Agency (NSA), which thinks it ought to be in charge. At stake are tens of billions of dollars in funding promised for a multiyear cyber-security initiative.10 Given the risks of a misdiagnosis or an inappropriate response, there’s the compounded potential of a misdiagnosis coupled simultaneously with an inappropriate response. A stomach transplant simply won’t do much for arthritis, it will only waste a load of money and put the patient at greater risk from resulting complications. Yet this is exactly the sort of situation that the Cult of cyberwar would put society in. Thomas Rid, a researcher in the Department of War Studies at King’s College London, distilled Clausewitz’s extensive analysis down into three tightly coupled ingredients. Specifically, Rid views war as being: violent, instrumental, and political. In other words, war is the employment of violence as a means (an instrument) to force opposition to concede to demands that are rooted in attributable and expressed political motivations.11 The definition used by the DoD also builds upon the one established by Clausewitz. In particular, the DoD’s Joint Publication 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, defines war as “socially sanctioned violence to achieve a political purpose” and adds that war is “characterized as a confrontation between nation states or coalitions/alliances of nation-states.” The latter clause is notable because it explicitly stipulates the involvement of nation-states. In other words, the identities of the participants are evident and correspond to sovereign entities. There has to be attribution. This is why soldiers wear marked uniforms and battleships fly flags. If war is a way to achieve political aims, how can a nation under attack make the necessary concessions if they don’t know who is attacking them? Hence, it’s not enough to merely identify political intentions mingled in with international intrigue. There must also be violence. Specifically, we mean acts of force which result in the sort of human carnage that occur when countries unleash the full might of their armed forces against each other. 1. Terrorism is part of a revolutionary strategy – a method used by insurgents to seize political power from an existing government. 2. Terrorism is manifested in acts of socially and politically unacceptable violence. 3.

Terrorism is part of a revolutionary strategy – a method used by insurgents to seize political power from an existing government. 2. Terrorism is manifested in acts of socially and politically unacceptable violence. 3. There is a consistent pattern of symbolic or representative selection of the victims or objects of acts of terrorism. Concrete examples of state-sponsored terror abound. The ongoing campaign of U.S. drone strikes in the Middle East is an acute example of state-sponsored terror13 as were the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan.14 In both cases the recipients of state violence have included large numbers of innocent civilians.15 Terrorists typically don’t have the resources to systematically overrun a country, a capability normally reserved for superpower militaries. Instead, they choose a small subset of symbolic targets to achieve the greatest bang for the buck in order to disseminate their message, so to speak. What terrorists hope for is that the sustained pressure of their attacks will wear away at the resolve of the targeted group. Incidents of cyber-terror, as delineated by Crenshaw’s criteria, are as scarce. In addition, the U.S. government has not responded to Anonymous by calling in air strikes. Instead, it has relied on law enforcement and international cooperation to capture hackers and relegated judgment to the judicial system. This kind of response is in line with the standard U.S. counterterrorist strategy that was consistently applied between 1972 and the Clinton Administration. The four key principles of this strategy were refusing to concede to terrorist demands, the imposition of diplomatic and economic sanctions, the enforcement of the rule of law by bringing terrorists to trial and multilateral cooperation.20 They didn’t implement a vast system of domestic surveillance. They didn’t suspend basic civil rights. They didn’t begin to capture, torture, and kill without due process. They didn’t, in other words, allow themselves to be terrorized. Instead, they addressed the threat. They investigated and arrested the cult’s leadership. They tried them in civilian courts and earned convictions through due process.21 The post 9/11 military invasions in the Middle East are uncommon responses to terrorism. Waging war against an entire country in an effort to combat a small group of terrorists is an incredibly reckless, wasteful, and destructive option. Countless thousands of innocent people needlessly paid the price for this approach with their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.22 In fact, there is a very strong argument that using this brutal approach only creates more terrorists.23 The CIA’s former head of counterterrorism, Robert Grenier, has stated: Espionage is a well-defined term, legally speaking.

The exact details are spelled out (at length) in Title 18 United States Code, Sections 792-798. These sections were, historically, the result of the Espionage Act of 1917. The Department of Defense offers a more bite-size definition in Joint Publication 1-02. Specifically, the Pentagon views espionage as: Note the emphasis on national defense. The topic of industrial espionage is actually addressed by the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which is governed by sections 1831(a) and 1832 in Title 18 of the United States Code. These sections deal primarily with trade secrets which are stolen, duplicated, traded in, or purchased to “benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent.” Violence is not part of the equation as far as espionage, in and of itself, is concerned. While it’s true that espionage does sometime occur during war, not many of the incidents of cyber-espionage surveyed by this book occurred within the context of an ongoing military engagement. Furthermore, there are very few, if any, instances in recorded modern history where a nation state initiated full-blown military aggression against another country in response to an act of espionage. You don’t call in an airstrike when you uncover a spy; you hand over matters to domestic security services. Since the Espionage Act of 1917, the FBI (originally the Bureau of Investigation, or BOI) has been charged with investigating cases of espionage within the United States. Crimes are a violation of public law, which is defined by a myriad of statutes at the local, state, and federal level. Gambling for example is legal in the U.S. at the federal level, though it is often prohibited at the state level. Both Colorado and Washington State have legalized the cultivation and sale of marijuana. In other locales, however, possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor (see California Health and Safety Code, sections 11357-11362.9) and in certain places possession of marijuana is a straight up felony (see Utah Code, Title 58, Section 8 of Chapter 37). It’s all a matter of codification. Strictly speaking, as we’ve shown, espionage is a federal crime. Though, as a matter of popular usage, when people refer to cybercrime they’re talking about something other than espionage (e.g. identity theft, bank fraud, extortion, the destruction of property, etc.). Depending on jurisdiction, crimes may be investigated by one of the many agencies in the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, an agency run by a state government, or a municipal police department.

In other words, this is largely outside the normal purview of the United States military. high-profile incidents as they can, in conjunction with a deluge of hypothetical worst-case scenarios, so that commentators can point to our general state of cyber-insecurity and loudly exclaim that a cyberwar is transpiring. By depicting the bulk of all cyber incidents as acts of war, the defense industry sets itself up to provide solutions. As we mentioned earlier, it’s only natural to turn over matters of war to the Department of Defense. The most effective countermeasure against this Orwellian manipulation is to sort incidents into their respective categories. Take a good hard look at what’s happening and call a spade a spade. Recognizing the various distinctions that we’ve spelled out makes it clear that instances of crime, or espionage, or terrorism are not equivalent to acts of war. Instead, they are perennial phenomena that will always plague society regardless of whether a war is transpiring or not. For example, espionage may occur during a war to gather intelligence, but that doesn’t make it equivalent to an act of war, because it fails to meet the criterion that the Department of Defense itself has spelled out. Collecting information isn’t a potentially lethal act of force, and as Thomas Rid observes: Crime and espionage, in particular, are pervasive in the online domain, as we’ll show in the following chapters. But the survey of incidents we’ll examine doesn’t reveal any cases of cyberwar. This, in turn, brings into question the wisdom of using the military to address the problems posed by online security threats. Furthermore, if military solutions aren’t optimal, then what sorts of solutions are appropriate? n this chapter we’re going to traverse a catalogue of genuine incidents that have been publicly reported both by the media and open source intelligence services. The general idea is to develop a view of reality that’s based on hard evidence and discernible trends instead of hypothetical worst-case scenarios. Rather than dwell on what could happen, We’re going to develop a baseline that’s founded on what’s actually happening.

This is what has been re-packaged to manufacture the perception of cyberwar. To graphically substantiate my counter-claim we’ve provided a large set of corroborating events that demonstrates the ubiquity of crime and the dearth of war. In this chapter we will focus on cybercrime, which over the past three decades has evolved from teenage mischief to a sprawling and profitable criminal ecosystem. he illicit profits generated by the drug trade have fueled the creation of intricate criminal syndicates. The scale of production has reached such levels that organizations have been forced to rely on the division of labor to achieve efficiencies.1 Ron Brooks, who oversees a drug task force in Northern California, states that if a cartel is going to survive: Similar forces are at work in the milieu of cybercrime. The profits have become so immense that the demand for entry into the market is tremendous. Crooks everywhere see a less risky way to make a fast buck and they want in on the action. Although the basic dance steps of the average cyber theft are the same as those traditionally used by burglars, the actual process of implementing these steps is relatively complicated and involves a variety of rarified skills. As in the domain of narcotics trafficking, criminal organizations have begun to specialize and rely on division of labor. Before we look into specific instances of cybercrime, we’re going to survey the general process to develop the requisite vocabulary and background. In particular, we’ll show how online crooks identify and pilfer data from unsuspecting users, fence the goods to turn them into cash, and evade law enforcement. Locating potential victims and infecting their machines can be a challenge for the uninitiated. To save time and resources, Pay-Per-Install (PPI) services have emerged. These allow cyber criminals to outsource the distribution of their malware. They simply contact a PPI provider and specify the number of systems they need infected and the geographic regions they wish to target. Rates are surprisingly affordable. For example, infecting 1,000 computers in the U.S. or Europe can cost between $100 and $200 .3 PPI services facilitate the creation of botnets.

A botnet is a large collection of compromised machines that are steered en masse by people known as bot herders. These infected computers are known as zombies because they are secretly being controlled from afar. Bot herders issue marching orders to their computer minions using intermediary machines known as command and control (C&C) servers, which are often compromised machines themselves. C&C servers not only disseminate commands, they also collect data funneled back up by the infected machines in the trenches. Having a hard time spreading your bot? Let us do all the work! We have a lot of experience when it comes to bot spreading and we know like no other how much time it can costs before your finally able to host boot, so now we offer Turbo bot Spreading for those who want bots FAST and cheap! In less then 24 hours you’re all set to start host booting. PPI services tend to install “droppers” on the machines they compromise. Droppers exist to receive software payloads from command and control servers and install them on the infected host (this is basically a low-tech variation of what anti-forensic people call a User-Mode Exec.). This way the outlaw employing the PPI service can decide how to leverage the compromised machine (e.g. send spam, collect passwords, perform a DDoS, etc.). The downloader merely provides a generic level of access. PPI providers often act as middlemen, sub-contracting out the actual infection process to affiliates who concentrate on specific infection vectors (e.g. drive-by downloads, phishing, file-sharing, etc.). An affiliate may just be a bot herder who, rather than searching out new machines to infect, hands over a subset of machines already under his control. Managing a large botnet like this can be a profitable venture. A 27-year-old hacker from the Netherlands purportedly made $139, 000 a month from leasing out his Bredolab botnet to spammers.5 Once a crook has stolen valuable information, they have to find a way to convert it into cash (i.e. they’ve got to monetize the illicit data). As you might expect, there’s a whole sub-economy dedicated to this task. For example, there’s literally an online commodity market of sorts for the computer underground, hosted on what are known as Carding sites. Carding sites are basically web-based message boards where outlaws can buy and sell stolen data (e.g. credit and debit card numbers, social security numbers, driver licenses, etc.). Crooks who deal in various aspects of bank fraud all over the world can congregate at these sites and do business.

In the lower levels of this commodity market, where data is turned into cash, are countless informal networks of money mules.6 Money mules bridge the online world with the physical world. The more sophisticated shops will fabricate counterfeit credit/debit cards and distribute the cards to cashers, people who’ll use the fake plastic to withdraw cash from ATMs or purchase expensive items (e.g. a $4, 000 high-end laptop with all the trimmings) which are then resold on legitimate exchanges like eBay. Mules take a cut of the money they collect and can profit handsomely, but they also assume the most risk. This is why money mules are viewed as the weak links in the cybercrime food chain. They have a notably short half-life, so to speak, because they have a habit of being photographed by ATM cameras and falling into patterns that law enforcement can capitalize on. To manage this high turnover, there are dedicated recruiters who run the equivalent of mule temp agencies in an effort to provide the market with a fresh stream of workers. There are legitimate/official services, like ThreatExpert.com and VirusTotal.com, which offer malware scanning free of charge. From the standpoint of a malware developer, the problem is that these legitimate services share their findings with the broader security community. Specifically, when they identify a malicious application they openly publish its signature so that discovered threats can be recognized by everyone else. This works to the advantage of the average user, but not for crooks (who don’t want their malware to be recognized as such). The underground services claim not to share their findings with anyone else. Building an online malware detection service is pretty straightforward and may be preferable for truly paranoid specialists. In a nutshell, you buy licensed copies of as many security suites as possible, crank them up to the maximum degree of heuristic sensitivity, and then create a web-based front end so that users can submit executable files for scanning. The specifics on how to do this are detailed at length in the Malware Analyst’s Cookbook and DVD.7 Another way to keep a low profile is to operate from a covert outpost within the vicinity of your target. In particular, accessing a bank account from a faraway location often indicates a fraudulent transaction, so cyber thieves prefer using a local proxy.

To this end, bot herders have started engineering their botnets to offer anonymity services. A hacker using this sort of service would connect to the botnet and have their Internet traffic routed through dozens of compromised hosts before being routed to the intended target. The TDSS botnet is a well-documented example on the Windows platform.8 Compromised zombies load a module named Socks.dll (as in TCP/IP Sockets) into an instance of svchost.exe, a common host process for Windows services. This rogue DLL implements a proxy server of sorts that can forward network requests on behalf of another machine. Get enough of these proxies to talk to each other, and the resulting network path becomes a Gordian knot that’s difficult to trace. According to researchers at Kaspersky, botnet herders charge around $100 per month to use an anonymity service. To make the technology easier to use, some botnet developers have even gone so far as to create a Firefox web browser plug-in for their anonymity service. To browse anonymously, simple enable the plug-in to channel web traffic through the botnet. Sometimes the authorities succeed in tracking the original destination of an attack; many crooks prepare for this contingency by relying on bullet-proof hosting. This is provided by hosting services that are willing to look the other way when people start complaining about SPAM and malware. The Russian Business Network (RBN) is a textbook example, where cyber miscreants could rent a server for $600 a month and do whatever they wanted. China is another well-known refuge that offers a similar pricing scheme (roughly $700 per month).9 To see how bullet-proof hosting works, it helps to understand how IP addresses are managed. At a very high-level, IP addresses are allocated by a nonprofit corporate entity known as a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).10 There are currently five RIRs worldwide. For example, the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the RIR for the United States and Canada. Each RIR hands out addresses in blocks to Local Internet Registries (LIRs), which are mostly backbone ISPs, large enterprises, or academic institutions. LIRs can, in turn, allocate blocks of addresses from their pools and assign them to downstream ISPs, who do the same for smaller ISPs lower down on the food chain. On paper, LIRs and downstream ISPs have to navigate through a formal screening process, where they answer a bunch of questions and provide supporting documentation to demonstrate that they’re legitimate. But there have been instances where criminal organizations have capitalized on countries where regulation is lax; hence, bullet-proof hosting.

It’s not so much a technical problem as it is a political and bureaucratic phenomenon. As the Secretary General of Interpol explains: Now that we’ve examined the basic environment in which online crooks operate, let’s look at a series of well-known incidents. From these case studies we will be able to distill some general conclusions about the true nature of the Internet-based threats that society faces on a day-to-day basis. There’s a lot of crime, but no war. This hasn’t stopped cyberwar PR from encouraging people to confuse the two, to associate relatively high-risk incidents with cyberwar and fuel anxiety. The end result is akin to someone who worries that a bomb will land on the house rather than that a burglar will break into it, and who looks towards the military for solutions rather than to law enforcement. Back in 2003, a young hacker named Albert Gonzalez was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service for making fraudulent ATM withdrawals. At the time he was a system administrator for a carding site named ShadowCrew. Given his level of access to the ShadowCrew site, the Secret Service made a deal with him to work as a paid informant. Gonzalez agreed to help them entice other criminals who frequented ShadowCrew by convincing them to use an allegedly secure VPN (virtual private network). This dedicated connection was then monitored by the Secret Service, allowing them to collect evidence. The sting, dubbed Operation Firewall, culminated in a series of raids during the fall of 2004 where authorities collared some 28 suspects from seven different countries. The Secret Service estimates that the forum trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit cards, costing financial institutions more than $4.3 million.12 As ShadowCrew vanished, Gonzalez began searching for a new score, despite the fact that he was still working as a paid informant. Specifically, he and his confederates identified a Marshalls store in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minnesota, that was using an outdated, and conspicuously insecure, encryption protocol (i.e. WEP) to protect wireless network traffic in the store. Using WEP to protect wireless network traffic is like trying to secure a bank vault with a screen door. It may be a deterrent to honest people but a determined thief would make quick work of it. Using a high-powered antenna, they captured data broadcast to cash registers and other computers by hand-held price-checking devices.

Using a high-powered antenna, they captured data broadcast to cash registers and other computers by hand-held price-checking devices. They used this data to crack the WEP encryption and then intercept user credentials as employees logged into the central database managed by TJX, the company that owned the store. They eventually set up their own accounts in the TJX database system and started to pilfer a veritable mother-load of credit card data. At the time of the intrusion, Gonzalez was pulling down $75, 000 a year as an informant for the U.S. Secret Service. In January of 2007, TJX admitted that it had been the victim of an “unauthorized intrusion” sometime in December of 2006.13 Sherry Lang, a spokesperson for the company declared that TJX had identified a “limited number” of credit card holders affected by the intrusion. As she put it, the number of customers affected was “substantially less than millions.”14 This turned out to be an understatement. Gonzalez and his partners in crime compromised 45.7 million credit- and debit-card numbers. In other words, this crime affected more people than the population of the entire state of New York. In a 2009 SEC filing, TJX stated that the breach cost the company $200 million.15 It was estimated that the banks that issued the compromised cards would end up spending more than $300 million to replace them.16 The feds pursued the TJX case for the better part of a year before coming to the realization in May of 2008 that the perpetrator was their own informant. Gonzalez was caught and, in March of 2010, sentenced to 20 years in prison for his part in the TJX Hack. Without a doubt, the TJX hack was a criminal act that was handled by law enforcement. Another factor that we see in the instance of the TJX hack is just how dangerous outdated technology really is, especially when it’s used to control network access. In this case it was an insecure wireless standard deployed at a major retail outlet. Hundreds of millions of dollars lost because someone failed to recognize and remediate an obviously weak link in the defensive perimeter. This is not the last time that we’ll see this sort of problem. Gonzalez had been pretty busy while working as an informant for the Secret Service. In addition to pulling the TJX caper, Gonzalez and two co-conspirators from Eastern Europe hacked into a slew of other databases belonging to companies like Heartland Payment Systems, 7-Eleven, and the Hannaford Brothers supermarket chain. The intrusions took place during the summer and fall of 2007.

The intrusions took place during the summer and fall of 2007. The attackers started with a list a Fortune 500 companies. After identifying a potential target they’d take a field trip to a local store to see what sort of payment processing software was installed on the checkout computers. For good measure they might also visit the company’s website to glean additional intelligence. They launched their operations from a set of geographically dispersed servers located in New Jersey, California, Illinois, Latvia, and the Ukraine. Naturally, these servers were leased under assumed names. The attack vector of choice was SQL injection, which entails manipulating an input query sent to a database server in order to get the database software to do something it shouldn’t (like open up a back door or peek at valuable data). In August of 2009 Gonzalez was indicted on charges of hacking. According to prosecutors the group made off with data for more than 134 million credit and debit cards. Heartland claimed that it suffered losses resulting from the breach on the order of $12.6 million.17 Almost a year later, in March of 2010, Gonzalez was sentenced. The 20-year stretch that he received for the Heartland job was scheduled to run concurrently with his earlier TJX sentence, adding only a single day to the total amount of time that he’d serve. In this case, the weak link that the intruders exploited was provided by poorly designed software, which proved vulnerable to SQL injection. Such applications make the unintentional mistake of accepting, and processing, arbitrary database commands. This provides the opportunity to subvert a database server by injecting malicious logic into an existing stream of database commands. In 2010 the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) ranked SQL injection as one of their top ten attack methods.18 A tried and true means of countering an opposing group is to play a fundamental role in its creation, so that it may be controlled and monitored from the inside. In other words, if you can manage both sides of a conflict, you can control its outcome. In the early days of the Soviet Republic, from 1921 until 1926, the government’s State Political Directorate (the secret police) ran a counterintelligence program known as Operation Trust.

The Russians used Operation Trust to capture and execute Sidney Reilly, the legendary British spy that Ian Fleming used as one his models for James Bond. Such was the basis for the FBI’s success with its DarkMarket Sting: surreptitious control from the inside. In an operation that was launched in 2006, Special Agent J. Keith Mularski spent the better part of two years infiltrating a carding web site called DarkMarket, which boasted a membership of 2,500 outlaws Mularksi positioned himself as a Polish spammer. With some help from the Spamhaus Project, he was listed as a prolific offender. Slowly he built up his credibility until he was a discussion moderator at DarkMarket. At one point, DarkMarket came under a denial-of-service (DoS) attack from a rival site. This presented an opportunity for Mularski to increase his level of access. He volunteered to bolster security by moving the forum to his server. The feds now had a unique vantage point; they controlled the machine that hosted the forum and, unbeknownst to the outlaws who used it, could secretly monitor everything that happened. Mularski closed the site down in September of 2008. Ironically, in his farewell message he told site members that he was worried the cops were closing in on him. The FBI’s operation, which involved extensive assistance from law enforcement in other countries, salvaged information on more than 100,000 credit cards and is believed to have saved financial institutions $70 million in potential losses. Worldwide, the DarkMarket Sting resulted in 60 arrests.19 What this story shows is the sheer scale of the online market for stolen data. DarkMarket was just one of many outlaw data-marts that lurk in the dark corners of the Internet. No doubt there are tens of thousands of operators out there who are actively trading. Data theft isn’t a niche market anymore. It has gone mainstream and the career criminals have all jumped onboard. This operation also demonstrates the importance of traditional police work. Though the lure of an easy fix may seem possible, strictly technical means are insufficient. Breaking online crime rings involves the same tedious measures that have traditionally been used against criminals in the past (e.g. informants, gradual long-term infiltration, patiently waiting for opportunities, etc.). As the U.S. bomber achieves a certain proximity to its target, the pilots are prohibited from accepting new orders under the assumption that the Russians may try to trick pilots by impersonating American officials.

There’s something to be said for this defense, and one can only wonder what sort of devious disinformation both sides cooked up during the height of the Cold War. One of the distinguishing features of Torpig is its level of sophistication. Getting infected with Torpig is an elaborate multi-stage process. Typically the user will be a victim of a driveby-download attack, where a browser flaw is used to download a tiny installer application. This installer, in turn, downloads and configures the Mebroot rootkit which embeds itself on a host by replacing the machine’s Master Boot record (MBR). The UCSB team was able to hijack the Torpig botnet by giving zombie machines the impression that they were speaking to a legitimate Command and Control (C&C) server, but they weren’t. They were actually interacting with a mock C&C server that was staged by the researchers. This put the researchers in a position where they could issue bogus commands and intercept data that the zombies collected. The researchers at UCSB estimate that the botnet under their control consisted of roughly 183,000 machines. Over the ten day period, Torpig siphoned off more than 70 gigabytes of data and extracted credentials for more than 8,000 accounts at 410 financial institutions. Topping the list were PayPal (1,770 accounts), Poste Italiane (765 accounts), Capital One (314 accounts), E*Trade (304 accounts), and Chase (217 accounts).21 According to George Ledin, a Professor at Sonoma State University who teaches a class on malware, one thing that interests the government researchers is the ability of malware to spread quickly. Take Conficker, for example, a worm that multiplied rapidly and, oddly enough, did so without really destroying anything. Its primary feature was its ability to proliferate. In November of 2008, RBS WorldPay, the U.S.-based payment processing arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was breached by hackers. The intruders initially got in by capitalizing on a software exploit. Then they located a card processing server and succeeded in cracking the encryption used to secure gift card data. The hackers raised their value limits and then manufactured a set of 44 counterfeit debit cards, which they distributed to a network of “cashers” who used the cards to withdraw cash from ATMs. They also filched the social security numbers of approximately 1.1 million account holders.22 In August of 2008, an Israeli hacker named Ehud Tenenbaum (aka “The Analyzer”) was arrested by the police in Calgary under suspicion of breaking into systems at Direct Cash Management, a Canadian firm that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:45:dc6d31b7e9f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3173, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "The hackers raised their value limits and then manufactured a set of 44 counterfeit debit cards, which they distributed to a network of “cashers” who used the cards to withdraw cash from ATMs. They also filched the social security numbers of approximately 1.1 million account holders.22 In August of 2008, an Israeli hacker named Ehud Tenenbaum (aka “The Analyzer”) was arrested by the police in Calgary under suspicion of breaking into systems at Direct Cash Management, a Canadian firm that deals in prepaid credit and debit cards. Canadian authorities contend that he’s stolen somewhere on the order of $1.5 million using stolen prepaid card data. If that weren’t bad enough, as he was about to enter the Canadian justice system, officials from the United States extradited him on grounds of hacking into a string of American financial institutions. The breaches occurred in the first half of 2008 and resulted in losses of roughly $10 million. According to the indictment, Tenebaum used SQL injection as an attack vector to access data from various companies on pre-paid cards. Tenenbaum made things easy for law enforcement investigators. The Hotmail account that he used to coordinate the attacks was registered under his actual name. Then there was also ATM footage that showed Tenenbaum withdrawing money from an account that he’d cracked. It’s surprising that an attacker like this would have such poor operational discipline while having the technical sophistication to breach the companies in the first place. In August of 2009, Tenebaum pleaded guilty in New York. As in the case of Heartland Payment Systems and RBS WorldPay, poorly designed software played a central role in enabling a $10 million theft to occur. At the same time, we also witness a rare instance of casual attribution, where law enforcement officers catch an offender simply by following the obvious trail that he left. Back in 2002, a hacker named Max Butler was busy scoring credit card numbers by breaking into computers maintained by other online crooks. That is, he was making a living stealing from those who stole. After several months of sharpening his teeth on poorly secured outlaw sites, he moved up the food chain and started targeting local mom-and-pop banks; the sort of modest regional establishments that couldn’t muster a substantial security budget. In his quest for credit card data, Butler would eventually expand his horizons and target retail outlets and payment processing stations. Problems started in the spring of 2004 when Aragon began to get sloppy. In one instance, he was nabbed by police after trying to use a couple of bogus credit cards at a hotel in San Francisco. This made Butler nervous. If Aragon’s carelessness became a liability he’d need to find somewhere else to sell his data. In an effort to head off trouble before it struck, Butler began looking for other ways to convert his credit card dumps", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:46:f55bb3125747", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3174, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "stations.

This made Butler nervous. If Aragon’s carelessness became a liability he’d need to find somewhere else to sell his data. In an effort to head off trouble before it struck, Butler began looking for other ways to convert his credit card dumps into cash. Butler ended up creating his own carding site, CardersMarket, a vast online bazaar for stolen data which boasted some 6,000 members. He fashioned this clearinghouse, arguably the largest on the Internet at the time, by forcefully consolidating the carding sites that belonged to rival administrators. And when we say “forcefully,” we mean it. In the summer of 2006, during a hacking marathon that lasted for days, he broke into the web sites managed by his rivals and emptied them out, taking all of their logins and databases with him. This kind of success tends to get the attention of law enforcement. Slowly but surely, the Feds started to close in on Butler. People got arrested and began to talk. Informants were cultivated and weaseled their way into Butler’s inner circle. The day finally came, in September of 2007, when Secret Service agents came busting through his front door to take him into custody. Operation Trident Breach began in May of 2009, when FBI agents in Omaha, Nebraska, were alerted to suspicious financial transactions involving 46 different bank accounts. After a substantial amount of digging, they uncovered a group of five Ukrainians who hatched a scheme to use a customized instance of the Zeus Trojan to pillage corporate bank accounts. This tiny cabal of malware developers and hackers disseminated their hand-tailored malware via e-mail to small and mid-sized companies. The attackers succeeded in penetrating machines at more than 390 U.S. corporations. The Zeus Trojan captured the banking credentials of users as they typed them in and then funneled the credentials back to the Ukrainians. They used the stolen login data to access the victims’ accounts and clear them out. To launder the stolen loot, the crooks maintained a network of some 3,500 money mules:24 Russian nationals recruited to receive the stolen funds in their own bank accounts and then re-route them back to the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians recruited mules by placing advertisements for students with J-1 visas on Russian language web sites.25 In the fall of 2010, Operation Trident Breach came to an end as a coalition of law enforcement officials launched a dragnet against the Ukrainians’ crime ring. More than 150 suspects were nabbed in a sweep that spanned from the United States, to the United Kingdom, and then on into Eastern Europe.

Losses attributed to the criminal enterprise over 18 months were reported on the order of $70 million.26 On April 26, 2011, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) published an alert regarding a large-scale hacking campaign emanating from China27. Over the 12-month period preceding the alert, the FBI registered 20 incidents in which intruders stole online banking credentials from small-to-medium sized organizations. According to investigators, the attackers explicitly targeted users who had access to corporate bank accounts. They’d infiltrate the victim’s machine using booby-trapped e-mails or by directing the victim to a malicious webpage. The intruders used malware like Zeus Backdoor.bot, and Spybot to pilfer banking credentials. In one specific case, attackers went so far as to cover their tracks by erasing the hard drive of a victim remotely to frustrate investigators. The attackers used the information they collected to initiate fraudulent money transfers to Chinese companies in port cities of the Heilongjiang province, located near the Russian border. In the 20 incidents investigated by the FBI, the average amount of money moved via wire transfer to China typically exceeded $900, 000 . Attackers also initiated a number of domestic Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers within the U.S. that ranged from $222, 500 to $1, 275, 000 . Total losses resulting from the intrusions are estimated to be roughly $11 million, though the attackers attempted to steal close to $20 million. The attackers avoided patterns that would lead to their capture. As things stand now, investigators don’t know who’s responsible for these transfers, if the bank accounts used in China were the ultimate destination, or if the money was then transferred to yet another account in a different bank. In other words, this very well could have been the work of Russian hackers using China as a launch pad. It’s also unknown as to why presumably legitimate businesses received the stolen funds. This raises questions related to attribution. While this is the first instance presented where the bad guys evaded capture and made off with $11 million, it’s hardly an isolated incident. Disciplined and technically capable operatives like King Arthur, the Eastern European hacker who ran a carding site called CarderPlanet, are smart enough to work through multiple proxies, pivot off of compromised machines, conceal their identities, and generally cover their tracks.

Knowing the IP address of the machine involved in an attack may not tell you anything at all. Or, even worse, it may send investigators down the wrong path. In the spring of 2011, various business units of Sony Corporation were beset by a series of attacks that left the company embarrassed and beleaguered. The first sign of trouble appeared on April 20, when Patrick Seybold, the Senior Director of Corporate Communication, posted the following cryptic message on the Sony PlayStation blog: Almost a week later, the truth came out. Seybold posted another message indicating that between April 17 and April 19, the Play-Station Network suffered an intrusion that compromised account information.29 As many as 77 million accounts may have been affected.30 Sony estimated that the PlayStation breach cost the company $171 million.31 The second wave hit servers belonging to Sony Online Entertainment (SOE). The intrusion was announced on May 3 of 2011.32 Approximately 24.6 million user accounts were compromised. The data snatched by intruders was mostly personal information (e.g. e-mail, birthdate, phone number, login name, hashed password, etc.). An older, outdated, database was also penetrated. It contained 10,700 direct debit records for users in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain. Yet again, SQL injection exposes poorly designed software. All attackers need is one little opening and Sony gave it to them. What’s even more disappointing is that a large company like Sony could have easily afforded to audit its software for security flaws and re-design the offending code to eliminate SQL injection bugs. For a tiny fraction of the amount of money that it spent dealing with the aftermath of the attacks, Sony could have avoided the incidents entirely. In May of 2011, hackers penetrated Citigroup’s Citi Account Online systems and accessed account information belonging to more than 360,000 customers.34 The company started sending out notification letters on June 3^(rd) and re-issued credit cards for more than 217,000 customers. Citigroup claims that data required to commit fraudulent transactions (e.g. social security numbers, birth dates, card security codes, etc.) were not stolen. Nevertheless, bogus charges were made on less than 1 percent of the compromised accounts (around 3,400). A study conducted by the Ponemon Institute and Symantec in 2010 calculates that the average cost of data theft in the United States is $214 per record.35 Assuming this is correct, Citigroup’s losses would have been on the order of $77 million.

The actual reported loss from Citigroup is much lower, about $2.7 million.36 Citigroup is no stranger to security incidents. Back in 1995, a Russian hacker broke into Citibank’s systems and made off with $2.8 million in illicit fund transfers.37 Later on, in the winter of 2009 the Wall Street Journal reported that Citigroup lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of another data breach. Citigroup denied this allegation, stating that “there has been no breach and there have been no associated losses.”38 Breach or no breach, law enforcement has yet to prosecute anyone in connection with these incidents. The intruder(s) simply vanished into the ether with their stolen data in tow. This goes to show that even highly visible mega-corporations are vulnerable to attacks that can be difficult to investigate Fidelity Information Services (FIS) is a publicly held financial services company that’s based out of Jacksonville, Florida. In the company’s first quarter earnings statement, released on May 3, 2011, FIS revealed that it had suffered a loss of $13 million as a result of “unauthorized activities involving one client and 22 prepaid card accounts.”39 As in the RBS WorldPay attack, the intruders were able to raise the withdrawal limit on the 22 prepaid card accounts they accessed. Then they fabricated counterfeit cards for the compromised accounts and passed them on to a network of “cashers” who were spread out all over Europe. On Saturday, March 5, as business hours in the U.S. drew to a close, the cashers sprang into action. They worked for nearly 24 hours straight withdrawing cash from ATMs in the U.K., Russia, the Ukraine, Spain, and Sweden. As the cards ran low on funds, the hackers would leverage their access to the compromised FIS system to replenish the cards with more money. Scareware schemes are based on convincing a victim that their computer is infected with malware. The con artists typically get their feett in the door by using web-based advertisements that warn of a malware infestation and offer a “free” virus scan. Sometimes the ad will even appear as a separate pop-up window that looks a lot like a legitimate anti-virus warning from the user’s existing security software. Accepting the free scan usually downloads an application that performs a mock inspection, warning of non-existent infections. This application is actually malicious.

In extreme cases, the targeted machine will freeze up until the user either buys the anti-virus software or rebuilds their machine. Scareware is big business. For example, Innovative Marketing Ukraine (IMU) made off with roughly $180 million in 2008 through developing and selling faux security software.41 To deal with customers who wanted their money back and throttle the level of credit chargebacks, the company made getting a refund more difficult by investing in a call center. Shady businesses like IMU survive by operating in locales where laws are vague (even permissive) or the officials charged with enforcement are willing to turn a blind eye. Operation Trident Tribunal was an international effort by law enforcement to take down two criminal rings that sold more than $74 million worth of phony security software to over a million unsuspecting users. On June 22, 2011, the FBI issued a press release providing specifics on the campaign. The FBI, in conjunction with authorities in other countries, seized more than 40 computers and servers located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, Lithuania, and Latvia. Law enforcement officials also froze five bank accounts. Both of the scareware networks that police disrupted appear to have been based in Latvia. One of the groups used advertising space on the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s website to launch their scam. While this story lauds the benefits of international collaboration, it also exposes the limits that law enforcement officials face. Specifically, what can investigators do when faced with attackers operating out of a country that doesn’t necessarily wish to cooperate? Local corruption in some foreign countries is pervasive, and this sort of fundamental problem doesn’t lend itself to overnight solutions. The very fact that companies like IMU exist, and thrive, is a testimony to this reality. ooking back through the previous cases reveals a number of recur-Lring themes. First and foremost, cybercrime is often enabled by buggy software and poor operational decisions. Time after time SQL injection reared its ugly head as intruders deftly fed tiny snippets of SQL code to insecure applications and made off with entire corporate data stores.

These deficiencies reside at the organizational level, where decision makers have either failed to mandate the establishment of security standards or failed to enforce them. The elusive criminals who exploit these security holes can be difficult to apprehend. Successful prosecution of an experienced hacker like Max Butler entails heavy application of well-known undercover techniques. There’s no quick fix, just the day-after-day grind of following up on an endless stream of seemingly dead-end leads. To make matters worse, the really cagey offenders have been known to utilize the same strategies and technologies used by national intelligence services and likewise evade attribution entirely. The crooks, who escape capture, end up funneling their stolen data into what could be characterized as a global online commodity market. The DarkMarket Sting should give you a whiff of how extensive it is. The underground scene for pilfered data is teeming with thousands of cyber outlaws who facilitate cybercrime by providing a way for hackers to turn their raw data into cash. The existence of these forums is proof that there’s a demand for stolen data and that cybercrime can be very lucrative. The losses are shouldered by individual and institutional investors – and even more frequently, the customers affected. To give you an idea of how widespread cybercrime is, let’s step back from the trees to view the forest. Though before we wade into actual loss statistics, wed like to acknowledge an observation that’s been made by researchers at Microsoft. Specifically, they contend that estimated losses due to cybercrime are vastly overstated: Most cybercrime estimates are based on surveys of consumers and companies. They borrow credibility from election polls, which we have learned to trust. However, when extrapolating from a surveyed group to the overall population, there is an enormous difference between preference questions (which are used in election polls) and numerical questions (as in cybercrime surveys).42 Notice that they’re referring to estimates. That is, extrapolations based on statistical surveys rather than concrete figures. The textbook example of this pseudo-scientific guessing is McAfee’s 2009 estimate that cybercrime global losses amounted to $1 trillion, an outlandish estimate which company executives later (after rounding their speculative statistic down to $100 billion in the summer of 2013)43 regretted.44 Reflecting on these ridiculous assertions, we would partially agree with the people at Microsoft. For genuine financial statistics that hover in the range of $1 trillion, which result in documented economic fallout, the public might be better advised to look toward outstanding student loans.45 We are sure someone feels like they were robbed. Keeping this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:52:12a2a43a0c11", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3180, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "to $1 trillion, an outlandish estimate which company executives later (after rounding their speculative statistic down to $100 billion in the summer of 2013)43 regretted.44 Reflecting on these ridiculous assertions, we would partially agree with the people at Microsoft.

Keeping this in mind we are going to eschew projected figures based on surveys and stick exclusively to figures that correspond to concrete losses. Despite the naysaying of skeptics, the losses are real and categorically nontrivial, such that cybercrime is taking a toll on society. It’s just that loss figures are nowhere near at the level that certain groups would like us to believe. In one recent case, an ATM heist involving re-loadable prepaid debit cards, the perpetrators walked away with $11 million in cash.46 In another case hackers stole over $1 million out of the payroll account used by a public hospital in Leavenworth, Washington.47 In May of 2012, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, charged eight men with stealing $45 million in a hacking scheme that targeted prepaid debit cards.48 In yet another case an escrow firm in California lost $1.1 million to fraudulent wire transfers.49 Let’s view the problem at a national level. In 2010 the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that compiles data and assists victims, recorded 662 data breaches in the U.S. which exposed more than 16 million database records.50 A similar report was published in April of 2011 by Verizon, in conjunction with the U.S. Secret Service and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit.51 The report covers a larger set of data breaches (761), which also occurred during 2010. Statistics compiled by DatalossDB.org report an even larger number of incidents, 802, in 2010.52 The Verizon report provides some additional insight into how the breaches occurred and the losses associated with them. Specifically, the 2011 Verizon report states that most of the breaches involved external attackers who surreptitiously gained access and installed malware on the victim’s system. This report also states that in 2010 the Secret Service apprehended over 1,200 people suspected of being involved in cybercrime and that the ensuing investigations revealed more than $500 million of loss due to fraud. There you have it: over half a billion dollars lost on behalf of some 761 data breaches. Compare this to “old-fashioned” bank robbery. In 2010, the FBI recorded just over 5,500 incidents of bank robbery where the crooks made off with approximately $43 million.53 On average, a bank robbery yielded less than ten grand. Contrast this figure against the crooks that were rounded up in Operation Trident Breach. They made off with something in the neighborhood of $70 million.

Contrast this figure against the crooks that were rounded up in Operation Trident Breach. They made off with something in the neighborhood of $70 million. In 2011 the FBI announced that it was investigating roughly 400 cases of corporate bank account takeover where the criminals stole $85 million.54 And the numbers just keep growing. A year later, late 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that the FBI, in tandem with security services overseas, arrested ten people running a massive 11 million node botnet that allegedly generated losses on the order of $850 million. To make matters worse, there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Statistics collected by DatalossDB.org on events involving the loss, theft, or exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) demonstrate that the phenomenon of cybercrime exhibits no signs of abating (see Figure 4-1). Likewise, figures compiled by Verizon detailing the number of confirmed data breaches per year also support this conclusion (see Figure 4-2). Widespread cybercrime is the new normal. Across the Atlantic, law enforcement officials in Germany have also been collecting statistics on cybercrime. In June of 2011, the German Federal Police announced a 20 percent rise in cybercrime (from approximately 50,000 cybercrime incidents in 2009 to approximately 60,000 incidents in 2010), resulting in a loss of $89 million.55 Chief Joerg Ziercke observed in particular that phishing attacks related to online banking fraud had risen 82 percent, to a total of 5,300 incidents in 2010. This, taken together Let’s step back even further from our national vantage point and look at things from a worldwide perspective. The Nilson Report is a trade publication for the payment system industry,57 definitely not something you’d see at your average news stand. A study performed by this publication found that total credit and debit card fraud worldwide was $7.6 billion in 2010, an increase of 10 percent from 2009 .58 To help put this into perspective, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports that the market for cocaine in the United States is around $37 billion.59 n retrospect, are U.S. citizens going to worry about bombs I dropping on their houses or burglars breaking into them? While proponents of cyberwar prefer to fixate on hypothetical visions of Cyber-Armageddon, there is a nontrivial amount of cybercrime taking place. As with the crack cocaine epidemic that hit the United States in the 1980s, it’s not necessarily an existential threat. Crime has always been with us and it always will be. Nevertheless, the resulting damage is significant enough to warrant attention.

Nevertheless, the resulting damage is significant enough to warrant attention. W hen the automobile was invented people still moved from point A to point B. Different means, same out-come. As the Internet has matured, information has begun to move online en masse. Although this provides additional means to acquire data, there’s nothing conceptually new going on here. For decades world powers have supported sprawling intelligence services that execute targeted, long-term, covert operations. For decades, private corporate interests have looked to gain competitive advantage by collecting intelligence on their rivals and customers. Spying is spying, whether it occurs on the Internet or otherwise. As mentioned in previous chapters, a common tactic employed in the media is to point to an incident of espionage and refer to it as cyberwar. This is because there are plenty of examples of espionage to draw from. In this chapter we’ll examine a series of such cases, instances of alleged cyberwar that have been covered by the mainstream press. In each incident we’ll try to identify where the attack emanated from, how the intruders got access, and assess what sort of evidence was left behind. Then we’ll step back and use these results to discuss recurring themes that appear. n March of 1998, a series of intrusions were launched against the I U.S. government in a campaign that targeted computers owned by the Department of Energy nuclear weapons and research labs, the Pentagon, NASA, and several academic institutions. The attacks continued for the better part of two years before being discovered. In response, the FBI led an investigation code-named Moonlight Maze. All told, they weren’t able to come up with much. Over the course of the inquiry they were unable to determine how many systems were compromised, the identity of the intruders, their underlying motive, or even the attack vector that was employed. People close to the investigation suspect that organized crime groups may be involved.1 Investigators traced the geographic source intrusions to a mainframe located within 20 miles of Moscow.4 As you might expect, U.S. officials lodged a formal complaint with the former Soviet Union. Likewise, the Russians denied any connection with the attacks. After all, the evidence was strictly circumstantial. The intruders could very well have “bounced” their attacks off of the mainframe in Moscow and staged things in a manner that led investigators to suspect Russian involvement. For example, the intrusions occurred between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Moscow time. Activity was also", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:55:703b59465d55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3183, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "of Moscow.4 As you might expect, U.S. officials lodged a formal complaint with the former Soviet Union.

For example, the intrusions occurred between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Moscow time. Activity was also discernibly absent during Russian holidays. This first example is an archetype for all of the incidents that will follow. Though the authorities were aware that something happened, the specifics eluded them. Furthermore they couldn’t determine who was responsible or even the extent of the damage. At the same time this didn’t prevent people involved in the investigation from passing on conjectures to the media, which gratefully received the speculative information and repackaged it as a tentative version of the truth. This explains why, despite the dearth of substantive evidence, the Los Angeles Times referred to this incident with headlines such as: “Russians Seem to be Hacking into Pentagon.” the U.S. government, military, defense contractors, and the World Bank. The intruders worked quickly and efficiently, scanning blocks of IP addresses for vulnerabilities and then executing orchestrated attacks that lasted from 10 to 30 minutes. As a coup de grace, they used rootkit technology to eliminate evidence and facilitate later access.5 A freelance security professional who volunteered his services to the FBI, Shawn Carpenter, traced the attacker’s network traffic back to routers in the Chinese province of Guandong.6 In terms of attribution, the director of research for the SANS Institute, Alan Paller, suggested that the Chinese Military was responsible. Paller is the go-to purveyor of quote on Chinese cyberattacks, of hackers compromising everything, of cyberlooting everywhere, of the electrical grid going down, on the need for more computer security training courses and of getting a press release in as a footnote in the Obama administration’s Cyberspace Policy Review …8 In other words, despite what Paller says, investigators were unable to even determine if this is the work of state sponsored agents, private-sector operatives, or independent hired guns. Damage estimates are equally muddled. According to official reports, no classified U.S. systems were breached during the course of the attacks.10 This makes sense, as the military’s classified networks aren’t on the Internet. The people who designed them were prudent enough to implement air-gap security. The GoG [Government of Germany] assesses these efforts are conducted for the purpose of espionage and present a significant threat to German interests. Targets cover a broad range of GoG activities including the military, the economy, science and technology, commercial interests, diplomatic efforts, and research and development.

In addition to activity similar to the aforementioned GoG infiltrations, the French claimed to have been victims of specific technical monitoring facilitated through computer network operations. The representatives indicated that believed Chinese actors had gained access to the computers of several high-level French officials, activating microphones and Web cameras for the purpose of eavesdropping. Infiltrations are generally accomplished through the use of socially engineered e-mail messages crafted to appear authentic and specifically targeted to individuals of interest. These messages normally contain an attachment or embedded link which is used to deliver malicious software (malware) onto the victim computer. Sensitive reports indicate the domains www.indexnews.org, www.indexindian.com, www.lookbytheway.net, and www. macfeeresponse.org were involved in Byzantine Hades (BH) intrusion activity in 2006. All four domains were registered in Chengdu, China. The IP addresses associated with these domains substantiate this as the location. Subsequent analysis of registration information also leads to a tenuous connection between these hostile domains and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Chengdu Military Region First Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB). When registering the indexnews and indexindian domains, Chen Xingpeng (a.k.a. Richard Chen) listed his postal code as 610041, the precise area of Chengdu associated with the PLA First TRB (a.k.a. Military Unit Cover Designator 78006). There is no official connection Never mind that all of this is circumstantial evidence. Even then, not all pieces fit together. Timing and types of target do seem to fit with the PLA hypothesis. But what doesn’t fit is why a government backed operation would be so sloppy as to commence an operation from an address in its own country. n June of 2008, the Office of the Dalia Lama asked investigators Ito examine office computers that they suspected had been compromised. One of the investigators was the editor of the Information Warfare Monitor (IWM), an independent research lab based in Canada.12 For the next six months they collected forensic evidence in Brussels, London, New York, and Tibet. This data was then passed on to researchers at the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto (the publicsector component of the IWM).

The investigators at the Citizen Lab used the evidence to identify four control servers (located in both China and the United States) and six command servers (located in China and Hong Kong). After scanning the four control servers with network probes, they discovered that the control servers were all running a (poorly secured) web application that was used by the attackers to manage infected machines. They co-opted these web-based management consoles to uncover a set of 1,295 compromised machines that were spread across more than 100 countries. The intruders relied heavily on spear-phishing as an attack vector.13 Infection was realized through malicious e-mail attachments or by links contained in the email that directed victims to drive-by download websites. Many of the compromised machines were infested with a “gh0st RAT,” an open source Remote Access Tool (e.g. “RAT”) which is readily available in the dark corners of the Internet. Who is ultimately in control of the GhostNet system? While our analysis reveals that numerous politically sensitive and high-value computer systems were compromised, we do not know the motivation or the identity of the attacker(s) or how to accurately characterize this network of infections as a whole. It is not inconceivable that this network of infected computers could have been targeted by a state other than China, but operated physically within China (and at least one node in the United States) for strategic purposes. Compromised proxy computers on Hainan Island, for example, could have been deployed as staging posts, perhaps in an effort to deliberately mislead observers as to the true operator(s) and purpose of the GhostNet system. The events surrounding GhostNet have all the hallmarks of a prototypical cyber-espionage campaign: Attackers leverage malicious e-mail as an entry tool in a widespread effort to steal an undetermined amount of sensitive information. Investigators know that something happened, and sometimes can even recover forensic artifacts, but their success in attributing the attacks is strictly limited. On April 21, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that intruders hacked into computers belonging to the F-35 Lightning II project and absconded with several terabytes of data.15 They gained entry by penetrating the networks belonging to contractors involved with the $300 billion project. The attackers somehow achieved access to a system used to diagnose maintenance issues during flight. The intruders, however, were unable to access “the most sensitive material” as high-security systems are normally not connected to the Internet. Again, air-gap security seems to afford some degree of protection.

Specifically, they sent out malicious e-mails containing a web link to a website in Taiwan. The web site, in turn, would cause the victim’s browser to execute a malicious snippet of JavaScript. This JavaScript contained a zero-day exploit that leveraged a software flaw in Internet Explorer.20 Having undermined Internet Explorer, this exploit established a foothold on the victim’s machine and linked up with command and control servers in Illinois, Taiwan, and Texas.21 By poking around the command and control servers used by the attackers, investigators were able to identify at least thirty-four companies that had been targeted.22 In addition to Adobe and Google, the list included big names like Dow Chemical, Juniper Networks, Northrop Grumman, Symantec, and Yahoo!. Google’s intellectual property, its source code (i.e. the engineering blueprints that describe the internal operation of its technology), was located on a series of software-configuration management (SCM) systems. SCM systems are basically glorified file servers that can track all of the revisions that get made to the files that they store. Every little change is logged and archived for future reference. In the old days, these servers would be referred to as source code control machines. It’s almost certain that intruders were able to access Google’s SCM repositories. Based on our analysis, “Aurora” was part of the filepath on the attacker’s machine that was included in two of the malware binaries that we have confirmed are associated with the attack. That filepath is typically inserted by code compilers to indicate where debug symbols and source code are located on the machine of the developer. We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation …25 Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this source code sample is that it is of Chinese origin, released as part of a Chinese-language paper on optimizing CRC algorithms for use in microcontrollers. The full paper was published in simplified Chinese characters, and all existing references and publications of the sample source code seem to be exclusively on Chinese websites. This CRC-16 implementation seems to be virtually unknown outside of China, as shown by a Google search for one of the key variables, “crc_ta[16].” At the time of this writing, almost every page with meaningful content concerning the algorithm is Chinese.26 Investigators also traced back network traffic to computers at Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Lanxiang Vocational School.27 Though, this doesn’t necessarily say that much because the machines involved could have just as easily been cover for a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:59:6796e8987e96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3187, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 60, "text": "Chinese websites.

According to Guinness World Records, Lanxiang boasts the world’s largest computer lab, capable of accommodating 1,135 students.28 When Google set up shop in China in 2006, the company agreed to censor its search engine results. This decision was criticized by numerous human-rights groups, as Google’s corporate motto is “Don’t be evil.” In the aftermath of the Aurora attacks, Google openly threatened to disable content filtering and leave China. As the company stated in its initial blog entry: The State Department also issued a public statement. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said, “We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.” Privately, the accusations were more pointed. A leaked State Department cable suggested that Aurora might have been initiated at the behest of China’s Politburo and involved a smattering of freelance operators, outlaws, and government agents.30 Over time, Google would continue to suffer additional high-profile attacks, like the Gmail account compromises of Chinese political activists that were reported in June of 2011.31 The Chinese government, which largely ignored Clinton’s statement, eschewed an official public response. Though, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology was quoted as saying that the Clinton accusation was “groundless and aims to denigrate China.”32 About half a year after the IWM published its report on Ghost-Net, the researchers at the IWM collaborated with the Shad-33 remained from the original investigation. Eight months of detective work ensued, and in April of 2010 the joint venture published their findings online.34 What they unearthed was an intricate distributed system of computers characterized by noteworthy advances in reliability, availability, and concealment. While GhostNet self-destructed very shortly after news of its existence went public, there were other attackers involved who left evidence at the scene. One of these other groups created what investigators dubbed the Shadow Network. As in the case of Ghost-Net, the intruders relied upon malicious e-mails to compromise end-users. What distinguished these intruders from the GhostNet campaign was their highly advanced command and control infrastructure. The Shadow Network’s command and control scheme was implemented using a novel tiered model that used several layers of servers. The first tier of servers used social networking sites to communicate directly with compromised machines. This is clever use of cloud technology, which leverages the underlying redundancy and fault tolerance of services like Twitter, Google groups, and Yahoo! Mail.

Not to mention that the bits of data sent and received from these web sites tend to blend in well with typical network traffic. The first-tier of servers was used to distribute malware payloads and direct infected computers to a second tier of command and control servers. This second phalanx of servers, which relied on machines maintained by free web hosting providers, is how the architects of Shadow Network built disaster recovery features into their system. They knew that investigators would eventually close in on their command and control infrastructure. As second-tier servers were detected and disabled by investigators, the first-tier would then re-direct infected clients to a more stable subset of dedicated command and control servers located in China. Investigators succeeded in gaining entry to a subset of poorly secured command and control servers. They also re-registered expired domain names used by intruders during the attacks. This allowed them to enumerate a list of compromised computers and acquire a snapshot of pilfered documents. Most of the attacks they analyzed targeted computers in India with an emphasis on networks run by the government and the military. However, computers belonging to the United Nations were also penetrated, in addition to machines owned by the foreign embassies (e.g. India and Pakistan) in the United States. The fact that the data targeted belonged to government agencies and that the attacks originated from computers in Chengdu might be seen as implying involvement on behalf of the Chinese Government. But without solid corroborative evidence (i.e. proof beyond a reasonable doubt) from traditional sources, eye witnesses, video footage, or undercover operations, the actual culprit is still unknown. Starting in November 2009, covert cyberattacks were launched against several global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies. The attackers targeted proprietary operations and project-financing information on oil and gas field bids and operations. This information is highly sensitive and can make or break multibillion dollar deals in this extremely competitive industry.36 The attackers gained a foothold in targeted corporate LANS using a multipronged strategy. Specifically, the attackers would penetrate outward facing web servers via SQL-injection exploits. These breached servers would then be used to capture user credentials needed to penetrate machines deeper in the network and install remote access tools (RATs). The attackers also used spear-phishing as an alternative mechanism to install RAT malware. Ultimately, the attackers used the embedded RATs to manage the exfiltration of sensitive data.

McAfee admits they don’t know who’s behind the attack, and that whatever forensic evidence they collected could very well be part of a false-flag operation. However, given the origin of the malware deployed in the attacks, the corresponding origin of the network activity, and the fact that the attacks occurred during business hours in Beijing’s time zone, investigators at McAfee suspect that the intruders may be Chinese. Although it is possible that all of these indicators are an elaborate red-herring operation designed to pin the blame for the attacks on Chinese hackers, we believe this to be highly unlikely. Further, it is unclear who would have the motivation to go to these extraordinary lengths to place the blame for these attacks on someone else. RSA is an encryption algorithm that was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman in the late 1970s. established a software company, named RSA Data Security to capitalize on their technology. The RSA algorithm played a vital role in the emergence of web security protocols like SSL in the mid-1990s. The company is also credited with providing the general public with security software that implemented strong encryption, something that did not endear them to the spooks at the NSA (who were probably hoping to limit the public to weak algorithms, ones that they could decipher). RSA is currently a security division of the EMC Corporation. Anyway, on March 17, 2011, RSA posted an announcement on its web site about “an extremely sophisticated cyber-attack” that had been launched against the company.37 As with Google and Adobe, no one likes to admit that they were done in by everyday hackers. The announcement didn’t provide many details, but it did mention: Our investigation has led us to believe that the attack is in the category of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Our investigation also revealed that the attack resulted in certain information being extracted from RSA’s systems. Some of that information is specifically related to RSA’s SecurID two-factor authentication products. While at this time we are confident that the information extracted does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation as part of a broader attack. For most people, authentication traditionally means providing a computer with a username and password. Two-factor authentication confirms a user’s identity by validating not only the password but also a second additional bit", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:62:8545d03fd964", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3190, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "products.

For most people, authentication traditionally means providing a computer with a username and password. Two-factor authentication confirms a user’s identity by validating not only the password but also a second additional bit of information. This is done to make it harder to impersonate someone. It’s not enough to just steal the password. In the case of RSA’s SecurID product, the additional piece of information is a long number that’s displayed on a small device called a token (often a key fob). This pseudo-random number is generated computationally with a new number being generated about once a minute. The basic idea is that only the user’s token and the remote server being accessed can reproduce the same stream of random numbers. If you don’t have a token, you can’t specify the necessary password/random-number combination. RSA claimed that the intrusion didn’t “enable a successful direct attack” against companies using SecurID. But this turned out to be wishful thinking on behalf of corporate leaders running in damage control mode. In May of 2011, defense contractor Lockheed witnessed an attack against its network. As a result, the company disabled most of its remote access facilities (e.g. VPN connections) and hastily distributed new SecurID tokens to its employees.38 Yet again, the attacks against RSA were initiated via spearphishing. The corresponding e-mails contained a Microsoft excel file as an attachment. The attached file employed a zero-day exploit targeting Adobe’s Flash player.40 The malicious payload activated by the exploit installed a RAT, allowing the attackers to accumulate credentials and move laterally across the organization until they found what they were after. From there, they would move pilfered data to a staging machine before exfiltrating it to remote servers. The use of the acronym APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) to describe attackers in RSA’s initial disclosure would seem to indicate a certain degree of sophistication. Yet, aside from the Adobe zeroday exploit, the intruders used fairly conventional tools. The only thing that truly stands out regarding the attack is that it was probably executed as a stepping stone to get into Lockheed’s network. It goes without saying that a company like RSA would prefer not to admit that they were done in by commonplace attackers. Attribution is sketchy at best. Researchers at Dell traced network traffic back to China.41 But, as we’ve explained earlier, this doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than the attackers may have routed their attacks through China. Subsequent revelations seem to confirm this.

One was very visible and one less so… We’ve not attributed it to a particular nation state although we’re very confident that with the skill, sophistication and resources involved it could only have been a nation state.42 As the investigation progressed, in March of 2011, researchers from McAfee were able to penetrate a poorly secured web-based command and control server used by the intruders in a western country and recover logs which allowed them to identify a tentative list of victims. What they discovered was a large-scale effort that targeted 71 organizations spread out over 14 countries over a span of more than five years.43 Dmitri Alperovitch, VP in the Threat Research division at McAfee christened this effort as Operation Shady RAT. The attacks recorded by the captured logs began in 2006 and continued onward until 2011. Dmitri suspects that near the end the intruders may have switched to other command and control servers and that this accounts for the eventual decline in attacks. It’s interesting to note that around 70 percent of the targets were in the United States and 13 of the 71 attacks involved corporations in the defense industry. Though there was a broad range of targets, including a number of national governments, heavy industry, hi-tech, the press (including the Associated Press), and a couple of think tanks. Individual attacks lasted anywhere from a month to over a year. Due to the variety of organizations and individuals impacted, there is no clear motive. There has been some discussion of this being a government-sponsored attack. However, the finger can’t be pointed at any particular government. Not only are the victims located in various places around the globe, so too are the servers involved in these attacks.44 n late October of 2011, a reported issued by Symantec46 described Ia series of attacks that began in April of 2011 and continued until mid-September. These attacks targeted forty-eight different companies situated in twenty countries. Over half of the targets were private sector interests in the chemical and advanced material industry. The intruders appeared to be looking for intellectual property, though they often tried to acquire Windows domain administrator credentials to facilitate their search. No details are available as to the specific nature of the data targeted. As usual, they used a malicious e-mail as their primary attack vector.

The attacks were traced back to a computer system that was a virtual private server (VPS) located in the United States. However, the system was owned by a 20-something male located in the Hebei region in China. We internally have given him the pseudonym of Covert Grove based on a literal translation of his name. t’s often hard to know whom to trust on the Internet. For Iexample, how can you be certain that the web site you’re visiting is the real McCoy and not some cheap knock-off trying to steal your credit card number? This fundamental question has driven untold mountains of security R&D. Most web sites currently solve this identity predicament using what’s known a digital certificate. Here’s some background: a digital certificate is like a formal letter of introduction used back in the 18^(th) century. It tells people who you are, details your credentials, and is signed by a known trusted individual. In situations where people who trusted each other were separated by large distances, letters of introduction were an accepted way to extend trust to a third party. Having vetted the identity of a web site, a process that can sometimes take days depending on the level of certainty required, a CA will subsequently issue the web site a cryptographically signed digital certificate. The certificate is instantiated as a special sort of computer file which follows a standardized format. Just as in the days of yore when the Duke of Windsor would bestow a letter of introduction to a departing emissary and stamp the letter with his seal, a CA puts its mark on a digital certificate to let the world know that the file is one of theirs. Web sites use a protocol suite called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to formally present their digital certificate to web site visitors upon arrival. Likewise, most web browsers have the built-in ability to validate the certificates that they receive. If a web browser comes across a digital certificate that it doesn’t recognize it will loudly complain by presenting the user with a highly visible message box. The cryptographic algorithms used by digital certificates may not be perfect, but they’re usually strong enough that attackers often decide that it’s easier to undermine the institutions that issue certificates, the CAs, rather than forge certificates head on.

The cryptographic algorithms used by digital certificates may not be perfect, but they’re usually strong enough that attackers often decide that it’s easier to undermine the institutions that issue certificates, the CAs, rather than forge certificates head on. In other words, counterfeiting a digital certificate from scratch is difficult enough that it’s far easier to simply break into the network of a CA and get their servers to issue a bogus certificate. There are over 600 organizations which act as CAs.48 Peter Eckersley, the Technology Projects Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, has noticed a disturbing trend: up until June of 2011, only fifty-five certificates were revoked because the corresponding CA had been compromised. Since June 2011 approximately 200 certificates, issued by four different CAs, have been revoked for the same reason.49 In this section we’ll examine two well-known cases in which an intruder found a way inside the perimeter of a CA and used their access to generate rogue digital certificates. Then we’ll see how attacking a CA is actually a specific instance of a more general trend: carefully orchestrated multistage attacks. A fraudulent digital certificate is like a fake driver’s license, it allows the owner to impersonate the entity associated with the certificate. This, in turn, could be used to redirect users to fake web sites (e.g. a spoofed instance of Gmail) so that the imposter can harvest user credentials. This is particularly attractive to nationstates that wish to monitor people who belong to dissident groups. According to Comodo, the intruder somehow acquired the credentials (i.e. the user name and password) to a user account owned by the affiliate organization which had the ability to issue digital certificates, and then used these credentials to create a whole series of counterfeit digital certificates. Investigators were able to trace back the origin of the attack: The IP address of the initial attack was recorded and has been determined to be assigned to an ISP in Iran. A web survey revealed one of the certificates deployed on another IP address assigned to an Iranian ISP. The server in question stopped responding to requests shortly after the certificate was revoked. VASCO Data Security International, Inc.

As part of its proposal, VASCO invites the Dutch Government to send staff to work together to jointly assess and remedy the problem.54 Security at DigiNotar was another issue raised by the Fox-IT report.

Investigators traced a significant amount of related network activity back to Iran. Most certificate authorities maintain what’s called Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) servers. These machines can be queried by web browsers to determine if a certificate has been revoked or not. During the attack on DigiNotar, investigators found that 99% of the lookups against DigiNotar’s OCSP servers were from computers in Iran.

(Nasdaq: VDSI) (www.vasco.com) today announced that a subsidiary, DigiNotar B.V., a company organized and existing in The Netherlands (“DigiNotar”) filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Article 4 of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act in the Haarlem District Court, The Netherlands (the “Court”) on Monday, September 19, 2011 and was declared bankrupt by the Court today. Attackers usually aim for the weakest link when they operate. If a target is sufficiently hard, interlopers may find it easier simply to redirect their attention to an outside dependency, like a third-party vendor that provides outsourced security services. For instance, if a bank’s security is too much of a challenge, bank robbers may simply opt to undermine the company that responds to the bank’s alarm. This is exactly the strategy used by attackers who broke into the corporate network of Bit9, a high-end security software vendor. Bit9 sells white listing software, which is the hi-tech equivalent of a nightclub bouncer. A white listing application stands guard as a computer runs, allowing only “trusted” software to launch. Usually this means that the software’s files have been digitally signed by some known CA (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Bit9, etc.). The software presents its digital signature to the White Listing application and, if all is well, the White Listing application lets the software load into memory and execute. There are two basic ways to keep malware from gaining a foothold. Conventional anti-virus software works by identifying, and disabling, known bad software.

There are two basic ways to keep malware from gaining a foothold. Conventional anti-virus software works by identifying, and disabling, known bad software. White-listing is the inverse of this process; it identifies known good (trusted) software and prevents anything that’s not trusted from running. Only officially approved software is allowed into the nightclub by the bouncer. You’ve got to be on the guest list, so to speak. As it turns out, someone at Bit9 neglected to install the company’s white listing product on a set of machines inside of Bit9’s internal corporate network.58 These machines were compromised in July of 2012 and the attackers then used them as a base of operations to steal a digital certificate which was used by Bit9 to digitally sign software. Because Bit9’s white listing software trusts Bit9’s digital certificate by default, the attackers could digitally sign their malware with this digital certificate and use it to attack customers who were using Bit9’s product. Bit9 did not provide details about the customers who were targeted, other than they were “three non-critical infrastructure entities.”59 The company has also stated in its corporate blog that it’s found 32 different files that were signed by the stolen digital certificate.60 The Sputnik framework supported over a thousand custom modules. It included modules intended to interface with desktop systems, servers, mobile devices, USB drives, and even network equipment. In other words, this was not the work of rank amateurs. To give you an idea of how meticulous and systematic the attackers were, the people that attackers pursued were literally assigned their own specific ID values, and in some cases the attackers went to the trouble to design and build custom modules, dedicated specifically to collecting information from a certain person. Basing on registration data of C&C servers and numerous artifacts left in executables of the malware, we strongly believe that the attackers have Russian-speaking origins. Current attackers and executables developed by them have been unknown until recently, they have never related to any other targeted cyberattacks.62 And it’s not just losses due to espionage that are unknown either. When you’re up against disciplined attackers, knowing the geographic origin of an incident doesn’t necessarily amount to much. As Robert McClelland, Australia’s Attorney-General, commented on a spate of attacks against resource firms: This hasn’t stopped some investigators from attempting to triangulate the true source of an attack.

In February of 2013, computer security vendor Mandiant published a detailed report describing an extensive intelligence campaign targeting various American news outlets. Mandiant claims that the campaign, dubbed APT1, was directly linked to PLA’s Unit 61398. After tracking the APT1 intrusion set over a period of seven years, the report qualifies its findings: A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398’s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398’s known mission.65 It’s been known to happen. The U.S. government’s Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the first nuclear weapon, fits this description perfectly. The Manhattan Project was an enormous undertaking involving over 100,000 people under extremely tight security. Security was so high, and so effective, that not even Vice President Truman knew about it. That is, until he assumed the helm as President.66 As far as geography and network access are concerned, they’re also red herrings. It’s been revealed that American spies use an elaborate web of foreign covers to launch cyber-attacks67 and have developed a real talent for subverting telecom backbones in other countries.68 What better place to operate out of than the locale of a known intelligence service? As we discussed at length in the chapter on China, there are a plurality of actors (many of them foreign) operating freely in the country’s rather lawless networks. We will spend much the next chapter extending this idea, in addition to addressing the problem of attribution at length later on in the book. While most of the ink in the press is spilled over who might be culpable for particular incidents there are very few where investigators were able to conclusively assign responsibility. While news reports and the blogosphere are rife with juicy innuendo, at the end of the day investigators usually fail to supply proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If this level of certainty is good enough for a court of law, shouldn’t it be good enough in the court of public opinion? Granted, there are those rare occasions when it’s fairly clear who spied on who and what was stolen. For example, in May of 2013 the Associated Press published a report describing how the U.S. Department of Justice, over a period of two months, secretly collected the telephone records of editors and reporters working for the Associated Press.71 Though the Department of Justice offered no formal explanation for its surveillance, it’s likely that the covert operation may be related to classified information that was leaked in an", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:69:c7e90c0c571e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3197, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "when it’s fairly clear who spied on who and what was stolen.

These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know … Several public-sector examples demonstrate that even in the major leagues security can be sloppy. The Comodogate and DigiNotar breaches are case studies in the danger of poorly chosen administrator passwords. There’s really no excuse for this sort of incompetence, especially when it comes to a certificate authority. Let’s not forget Google, where people are so busy being brilliant that they left the company’s source code relatively unprotected. Even purportedly secured government networks apparently suffer from insufficient day-to-day security. U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning was able to successfully smuggle out thousands of diplomatic cables from SIPRNet by burning them to a faux Lady Gaga CD. As Manning observed in an on-line chat session: While the press seems to focus on the intelligence gathering of other countries (e.g. China, Russia, Eastern Europe), the truth is that the United States stands out with regard to stealing other people’s secrets. Just ask the career officers over in the NSA’s Signals-Intelligence Directorate or the agents in the CIA’s Special Activities Division. Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA3 admitted: A few weeks later, Der Spiegel reported that the United States had executed cyber-attacks against offices of the European Union in Washington and New York.6 In later articles Der Spiegel would divulge that U.S. intelligence agencies had also targeted offices at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in addition to the United Nations video conferencing system.7 French newspaper Le Monde disclosed that in a single month, from December 10, 2012 to January 8, 2013, the NSA collected over 70 million metadata records on telephone calls in France.8 The journalists who reported this story observed that targets included people involved in business, the state bureaucracy, and politicians. In one internal NSA memo described by Le Monde, then American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:70:4700a642f231", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3198, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "Energy Agency (IAEA) in addition to the United Nations video conferencing system.7 French newspaper Le Monde disclosed that in a single month, from December 10, 2012 to January 8, 2013, the NSA collected over 70 million metadata records on telephone calls in France.8 The journalists who reported this story observed that targets included people involved in business, the state bureaucracy, and politicians. In one internal NSA memo described by Le Monde, then American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, was quoted as saying that the NSA’s surveillance of French diplomats allowed the United States to gain the upper hand during negotiations.9 An Italian news outlet, L’Espresso, reports that the NSA and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ monitored Italian corporations in addition to the Italian government using three fiber optic cables with landings in Italy. This surveillance took place under the auspices of an information sharing-agreement with Italian intelligence services.10 Let’s step back from the trees for a moment and look at the entire forest. Based on leaked documents and media reports, the web site Cryptome published an analysis which calculates that the NSA collected approximately 124.8 billion telephone metadata records in a single 30-day period. The breakdown for the 30 days leading up to January 8, 2013 follows: Pakistan: 12.76 Billion Afghanistan: 21.98 Billion India: 6.28 Billion Iraq: 7.8 Billion? (blurry image) Saudi Arabia: 7.8 Billion? (blurry image) United States: 3 Billion? (blurry image) Egypt: 1.9 Billion? (blurry image) Iran: 1.73 Billion Jordan: 1.6 Billion Germany: 361 Million France: 70.2 Million Spain: 61 Million Italy: 46 Million Netherlands: 1.8 Million13 High ranking politicians seem to be attractive targets. A TV news program broadcast in Brazil, Fantastico, revealed that both the presidents of Brazil and Mexico had been targets of NSA surveillance.14 This was corroborated in more detail by a later report in Der Spiegel.15 A leaked internal document boasted: In October of 2013, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, called up U.S. President Barack Obama and angrily demanded explanations regarding reports that the NSA had been monitoring her mobile phone. Shortly afterwards the White House’s National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, offered a public statement: Notice how any reference to past monitoring is absent. A leaked NSA memo from 2006 indicates that several U.S. officials handed over their contact lists to the NSA, allowing the agency to monitor 35 world leaders.17 Furthermore the memo admits that such monitoring produced “little reportable intelligence.” We believe our offense is the best in the world. Cyber offense requires a deep, persistent and pervasive presence on adversary networks in order to precisely deliver effects. We maintain that access, gain deep understanding of the adversary, and develop offensive capabilities through the advanced skills and tradecraft of our analysts, operators and developers. When authorized to deliver offensive cyber effects, our technological and operational superiority delivers unparalleled effects against our adversaries systems.18 Information about innocent", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:71:a148bd78232c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3199, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "produced “little reportable intelligence.” We believe our offense is the best in the world.

When authorized to deliver offensive cyber effects, our technological and operational superiority delivers unparalleled effects against our adversaries systems.18 Information about innocent Americans that hasn’t been taken out of the data that’s being shared with our intelligence partners. And it’s troubling for a couple of reasons, the first of which, we haven’t known about this, and this may have been going on for years, and the second of which, there’s no avenue for Americans, innocent Americans who are swept up into these dragnets and have their information handed over to our intelligence partners, to stop that flow of information, to assert their rights and prevent it.22 Anyway, it goes without saying that Michael Hayden and Keith Alexander are probably correct. The United States is the Internet’s number one offender. This only makes sense, as the United States feeds a mountain of resources into its intelligence apparatus. In 2010 the U.S. government spent $80.1 billion on intelligence.23 This is more than the U.K.’s entire 2012 defense budget.24 The $80 billion figure from 2010 can be broken down into two parts. Roughly $53 billion was allocated to non-military agencies, and $27 billion was devoted to military operations. In 2011, the nonmilitary portion of intelligence appropriations was increased to $54 billion.2 ⁵In 2013 this figure was roughly consistent at $53 billion.26 It’s funny how various people, e.g. European government institutions, are afraid of using closed source software, e.g. Windows, because they are afraid of Microsoft putting backdoors there. Yet, they are not concerned about using processors made by some other U.S. companies. It is significantly more risky for Microsoft to put a backdoor into its software, where even a skilled teenager equipped with IDA Pro can find it, than it is for Intel or AMD, where effectively nobody can find it. 29 In other words, software-level backdoors may be a threat but at least you can identify them. Hardware-level subversion is much more insidious because it’s very difficult to detect, as public research on hardware-level rootkits has verified.30 Concerns of this nature were voiced in May 2009, by the Obama administration’s Cyberspace Policy Review: Increasingly when you buy computers they have components that originate from places all around the world. We need to look at the question of how we assure that people are not embedding in very small components or things that go into computers that can be triggered remotely and then become the basis of ways to [steal] information …32 The same way hacking can be a threat, vulnerabilities can derive from compromised", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:72:022a4cc539be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3200, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 73, "text": "May 2009, by the Obama administration’s Cyberspace Policy Review: Increasingly when you buy computers they have components that originate from places all around the world.

The purpose of this investigation is to determine to what extent Chinese communications companies are exploiting the global supply chain and how we can mitigate this threat to our national and economic security. In 2008 a merger between 3Com and Huawei was blocked after members of the U.S. intelligence community voiced opposition to the deal on the grounds of national security.34 Similar protest arose from spies in the U.K. when British Telecom agreed to use equipment from Huawei in a massive £10 billion network overhaul.35 In March of 2012, despite significant diplomatic outcry, the Australian federal government out-and-out banned Huawei from tendering offers in multibillion-dollar deals to supply equipment for the country’s national broadband network.36 At the same time something similar happened in the United States. Buried deep in a spending bill (H.R. 933) were two paragraphs (i.e. see Section 516) which stipulate that technology acquired by the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, NASA, and the National Science Foundation must be vetted by the government if they’re “being produced, manufactured, or assembled by one or more entities that are owned, directed, or subsidized by the People’s Republic of China.”37 Is there any real substance to these claims? Perhaps, but it’s all classified. In July of 2013, news leaked of secret government reports contending that PC maker Lenovo, which is headquartered in Beijing, was selling machines that contained hardware-level backdoors. Though this is a fairly recent story, the security services have known about it for a while. For the past ten years or so intelligence services in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have banned computers manufactured by Lenovo.38 For example, in a 1995 article published by the Baltimore Sun, reporters divulged that the NSA had secretly worked with a Swiss company named Crypto AG during the Cold War to rig the company’s encryption hardware so that the NSA could easily decipher coded messages generated by the hardware.39 Crypto AG, which sold its products to over 120 different countries, had repeatedly and vehemently denied such collaboration. Intel, in particular, sells processors that have features which are implemented in reprogrammable logic embedded within the chips themselves (aka microcode). Microcode update packages released by Intel include payloads that are encrypted and adhere to a proprietary specification, making them an ideal mechanism for intelligence services to insert backdoors. Some Intel processor families, like", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:73:9d81b5eb8d18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3201, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "easily decipher coded messages generated by the hardware.39 Crypto AG, which sold its products to over 120 different countries, had repeatedly and vehemently denied such collaboration.

Microcode update packages released by Intel include payloads that are encrypted and adhere to a proprietary specification, making them an ideal mechanism for intelligence services to insert backdoors. Some Intel processor families, like the Intel Core vPro, already have autonomous remote access features built-in. This kind embedded Out-of-Band (OOB) access is based on a miniature operating system and network stack that’s packaged onto the chips. Intel calls this Active Management Technology. It offers full, unadulterated, access to a computer even if the machine is turned off. Heck, the machine doesn’t even have to be plugged into a wired network as the remote technology supports wireless connectivity.41 Having a special back door into technology like this would yield a gratis rootkit that should make even the most skilled security professional squeamish. Perhaps this explains why, in the wake of Ed Snowden’s leaks about offensive U.S. operations, the Kremlin has fallen back on electric typewriters?42 But the government isn’t just into hardware-level subversion; it’s also involved in more pedestrian software-level tricks. Der Spiegel has reported that intelligence services can easily compromise smart phones sold by Apple, BlackBerry, and Google. As you might expect they’re a treasure trove of data. The NSA literally formed teams to attack each mobile platform: The agency [the CIA] is looking at how independent contractors hired by arms makers to write software for weapons systems could be bribed to slip in viruses. “You get into the arms manufacturer’s supply network, take the stuff off-line briefly, insert the bug, then let it go to the country,” explained a CIA source who specializes in information technology. “When the weapons system goes into a hostile situation, everything about it seems to work, but the warhead doesn’t explode.” In other instances, the intelligence services don’t have to bribe anyone because they’re able to get software vendors to cooperate using export controls. A former senior intelligence official says that in the late 1990s a bargain was struck between the NSA and hi-tech companies over the use of strong cryptography (i.e. encryption tools that are difficult to crack). The gist of the deal between the government and the private sector was this: vendors were allowed to export high-grade cryptographic components in return for allowing the NSA to “review” it (peek at the internal workings) and, if deemed necessary, establish back doors.45 The deal went something like this: Giles offered you preferential treatment for export if you would add a back door. The back door could be subtle enough that it wouldn’t show up in the design, and only be obvious if someone analyzed the binary code. It", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:74:77d0e3f8581d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3202, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "the private sector was this: vendors were allowed to export high-grade cryptographic components in return for allowing the NSA to “review” it (peek at the internal workings) and, if deemed necessary, establish back doors.45 The deal went something like this: Giles offered you preferential treatment for export if you would add a back door. The back door could be subtle enough that it wouldn’t show up in the design, and only be obvious if someone analyzed the binary code. It could be something that would easily be viewed as a mistake if someone learned about it. Maybe you could weaken your random number generator, or leak a few key bits in a header. Anything that would let the NSA decrypt the ciphertext without it looking like the crypto was broken.46 Though public knowledge is scarce, this sort of cryptographic subversion is part of an industry-wide campaign. The NSA spends over $250 million each year on what called the Sigint Enabling Project (Sigint as in Signal Intelligence). According to top-secret documents the NSA “actively engages the U.S. and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and/or leverage their commercial product designs” so that their commercial products are “exploitable.”48 For example, when a couple of in-house cryptographers at Microsoft discovered a serious flaw in a standard that had been adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2006, a classified government memo confirmed that the flaw was intentionally introduced by the NSA, which had hounded the NIST to accept the standard.51 The NSA has also been known to use the direct approach and outright seize encryption keys. In July of 2013 an anonymous source told journalists from CNET that the government was asking Internet service providers to hand over the encryption keys used to secure web-based communication (i.e. the keys used to facilitate SSL-based sessions).52 In September of 2013, the New York Times further revealed that the NSA maintains what’s known as the Key Recovery Service, a special unit which is tasked with acquiring encryption keys, though the specifics of how they acquire them (e.g. theft, bribery) is sketchy.53 Having these keys allows intelligence services to decrypt connections en masse so that thousands of otherwise secure sessions can be analyzed. When all else fails, the spooks send in members of the Special Collection Service (SCS). The SCS is a covert program that leverages expertise from both the CIA and NSA to intercept communication in circumstances where U.S. spies need to direct access to targets in order to plant and operate eavesdropping equipment (e.g. think breaking and entering, close surveillance).54 There are 74 staffed SCS sites worldwide.55 There’s little doubt that the United States spies, primarily on other national governments. But at the same time there are people who claim that it all stops there.

But at the same time there are people who claim that it all stops there. For example, in an op-ed that appeared in the Washington Post, James Lewis of the think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) asserts unequivocally: Every country in the world, large and small, engages in intelligence gathering, and that is an occasional source of tensions, but is generally practiced within bounds. There is a big difference between China wanting to figure out how can they find out what my talking points are when I’m meeting with the Japanese which is standard fare…. There’s a big difference between that and a hacker directly connected with the Chinese government or the Chinese military breaking into Apple’s software systems to see if they can obtain the designs for the latest Apple product. That’s theft. And we can’t tolerate that.60 The United States does indeed steal secrets from foreign businesses. Back in 1995 former CIA officer Philip Agee stated during a television interview that the CIA has been involved in economic espionage since its inception, particularly with regard to developing negotiating positions on trade agreements.61 In fact, he went further, claiming that the practice of state intervention abroad in this manner, on behalf of multinational businesses, is something that predates World War II. According to statements made by former CIA Director James Woolsey at a press conference held in the State Department’s Foreign Press Center in D.C., the United States regularly spies on foreign corporate interests to track dual-use technology, detect the violation of economic sanctions, as well as unearth political corruption.62 But that’s not all. The tactics of the U.S. government since September 11 is to say that everything is justified by terrorism. Scaring people to accept these measures as necessary. But most of the spying they do does not have anything to do with national security, it is to obtain an unfair advantage over other nations in their industrial and commerce economic agreements.65 The government’s own records support this view. In a 2009 letter to written to the NSA by Thomas Shannon, then the Assistant Secretary of State, he lauded the NSA for information it passed on before the Fifth Summit of the Americas, a conference where the heads of state of the continent deliberated over commercial issues: In August 2009, according to internal documents, the agency gained access to the emails of various high-ranking officials in Mexico’s Public Security Secretariat that combats the drug trade and human trafficking.

This hacking operation allowed the NSA not only to obtain information on several drug cartels, but also to gain access to “diplomatic talking-points.” In the space of a single year, according to the internal documents, this operation produced 260 classified reports that allowed U.S. politicians to conduct successful talks on political issues and to plan international investments. Within weeks of this information becoming public knowledge, the Globo news outlet published a story detailing how the NSA targeted a Brazilian oil giant named Petrobras, a company partially run by the state which sports annual profits on the order of $120 billion.69 So it would seem that, at a bare minimum, the NSA engages in economic espionage in Latin America. Globo also reported that the NSA was spying on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the cooperative network of over 10,000 banks in 212 countries which handles the transmission of almost every financial payment order that crosses international borders. This is interesting because the U.S. Treasury already has access to SWIFT data through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP). TFTP was launched in the wake of 9/11 in the name of counterterrorism. Supposedly officials implemented various controls and safeguards to ensure that data subpoenaed by the U.S. Treasury is used strictly for that purpose. Globo’s disclosure implies that perhaps the NSA has been secretly acquiring SWIFT data for reasons not related to counterterrorism. This raises a lot of questions. The information from the American foreign intelligence agency, acquired by former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, show that the spying is conducted by a branch called “Follow the Money” (FTM). The collected information then flows into the NSA’s own financial databank, called “Tracfin,” which in 2011 contained 180 million records. Some 84 percent of the data is from credit card transactions.70 Of course, the United States isn’t alone in spying on foreign companies. The 2013 National Intelligence Estimate, which represents a consensus opinion of the U.S. Intelligence Community, claims that China, France, Israel, and Russia are also involved in stealing economic secrets.73 The difference is that the U.S. government pours a whole lot more resources into it. As we’ll see in Chapter Ten the sheer scale of the U.S. surveillance apparatus dwarfs that of other countries. Researchers who study political game theory have been known to theorize that spying is inevitable. They’d argue, using logical models like the Prisoner’s Dilemma, that national governments are forced to spy.

They’d argue, using logical models like the Prisoner’s Dilemma, that national governments are forced to spy. This stance concludes that decision makers don’t have a choice, they either spy or they lose (because if they don’t spy, their opponents may spy and in doing so gain the edge). So, governments choose to spy. Often under the guise of intentionally vague, self-serving, generalities like the national interest. Former officials have warned that the United States would be put at a severe disadvantage if it limited engagement in cyber espionage.74 The idea that everyone is doing it and others would do it if they could except we’re better so they hate us for our capabilities is a race to the bottom argument. It could be used to excuse just about any intrusive and objectionable conduct, such as flying surveillance drones in any country’s airspace or building secret prisons for interrogating prisoners in any country’s land.77 I think Americans haven’t quite understood the anger of other states, of people living in Germany, you say, that Americans feel free to spy on anybody else in the world, and you just have to, sort of, reverse that and think how would Americans feel if Germans were spying on them, or the Chinese. Well, we know how people feel about the Chinese.… I mean, again, put it the other way around, if we discovered that Brazil was trying to listen to President Obama’s phone calls or emails, there would be outrage. So, you can understand why other states just are offended by this kind of behavior.79 It’s clear that unbridled mass interception tramples on fundamental human rights, the very same rights which safeguard against the emergence of police states. It would seem that the purveyors of Orwell’s nightmare are willing to pay for their alleged “national security” using individual privacy at home and abroad as currency. This sense of entitlement is a defining aspect of the Deep State. It’s rooted in our history. An early example of this mindset was noted by Mark Twain on September 7, 1906, during a speech at the Ends of the Earth Club. An indignant Twain remarked that he had recently witnessed a Union General make the following statement: Our leaders certainly don’t make much of a fuss when other countries get hacked. When the Chinese complain of “massive and shocking” intrusions, its disclosures are met with silence.84 At the same time many U.S. officials seem to erupt in fits of righteous indignation when other countries steal our secrets.85 According to top-secret documents acquired by the Washington", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:78:6b45f833fcd8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3206, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "the Ends of the Earth Club.

NSA Whistleblower Ed Snowden told reporters in Hong Kong that the United States has conducted more than 61,000 hacking operations globally.87 This self-affirming belief – I can do X because I’m Good and you are barred from X because you are Bad – is the universally invoked justification for all aggression. It’s the crux of hypocrisy. And most significantly of all, it is the violent enemy of law: the idea that everyone is bound by the same set of rules and restraints …88 Exerting soft power and attracting other people to follow your lead means steering clear of double standards. If you knew someone who feverishly went around breaking windows in other people’s houses day after day, you’d probably be hard pressed to offer any sympathy when someone finally turned around and broke a window in his house. Not only that, but you’d probably be mystified that someone so versed and experienced at breaking windows would even be so thoughtless as to even have windows to begin with. In fact, you might even be tempted to conclude that they had it coming. In 2010 the nations of France and the United States tried to broker a written agreement where they agreed not to spy on each other. It was a more formal attempt of the long-standing gentleman’s agreement that exists between the U.S. and the UK. The deal with France fell through because there were high-level officials on both sides that wanted to keep spying.89 Look at it this way, if the U.S. was confronted by Chinese leaders over an intelligence campaign inside China’s borders, would the CIA suspend its efforts or simply push them deeper undercover? Would, under any circumstances, the CIA truly cease to spy? Not if the Deep State has any say in things (espionage is a growth sector). n the realm of cyber-espionage there’s a burgeoning industry I devoted to selling offensive software and surveillance tools.

The private sector is a significant source of cyber-tools for U.S. intelligence agencies. If you doubt this, check out the WikiLeaks Spy Files submission site,90 or the Wall Street Journal’s Surveillance Catalogue.91 There’s a flourishing market that services repressive regimes, like Tunisia, that want to spy on their citizenry.92 As Julian Assange stated as a press conference in December of 2011: Much of the surveillance trade’s activity takes place at ISS World conferences organized by TeleStrategies, a company based out of McLean, Virginia. The sponsor list for ISS World provides a veritable who’s-who of the industry.93 This invitation-only setting allows vendors to meet spies from all over the world and sell them high-end interception solutions. ISS stands for Intelligence Support Systems, and the gatherings ostensibly are directed towards law enforcement types, telecom providers, and government employees. Nevertheless, the technology is inherently dual-use. There’s really nothing to stop this equipment from being used by organizations to monitor political dissidents, human rights advocates, journalists, and alleged enemies of the state. Kaspersky researcher Sergey Golovanov remarks: The problem with so-called -legal- spy tools is that any government can purchase them, including governments from countries with poor human rights records. Additionally, one government can purchase these tools and use them against another country.… The lack of regulation, the widespread trading of such dangerous technologies to pretty much anyone who has the money and the fact that they’ve already been in many dubious cases raises a big question about who will be held liable …95 In March of 2011, protestors in Egypt raided the headquarters of the State Security Services. They found what looks like a $353, 000 invoice for a surveillance software framework called FinFisher that’s sold by a software company called the Gamma International.96 There’s no evidence if the transaction was executed or not. A few months later, in August of 2011, the Wall Street Journal published an article revealing that a French vendor named Amesys had developed a mass interception product for the Libyan regime of Moammar Gadhafi. The monitoring package was implemented for Libya after it signed a contract with Amesys in 2007, and it was wielded for several years to collect the e-mails, social media posts, and online chat messages of anyone perceived to be a threat.

A Chinese company, ZTE Corp., as it happens, also had agreements with Libyan security services98 and it appears that the company may have ties with other repressive governments. In March of 2012, it came to light that ZTE had sold a mass interception system to Iran as part of a $130 million contract. The system, which utilizes what’s known as deep packet inspection, allows operators to dig into the contents of e-mails, web browser traffic, and video chat sessions.99 It’s no surprise that there’s a thriving market for surveillance technology in China. The central party leadership sees it as a necessary tool for maintaining control, and leading hi-tech companies have been there to assist towards this end. For example, a leaked internal Cisco document, written back in 2002, shows that Cisco viewed China’s Golden Shield censorship system as a money-making opportunity.100 Negative posts do not accidentally slip through a leaky or imperfect system. The evidence indicates that the censors have no intention of stopping them. Instead, they are focused on removing posts that have collective action potential, regardless of whether or not they cast the Chinese leadership and their policies in a favorable light.101 In addition to spying on ordinary citizens, it’s well known that Chinese leaders frequently spy on each other. In a development that’s reminiscent of Nixon’s Watergate scandal, Bo Xilai, the former Communist Party Chief of the city of Chongqing, was found to have been monitoring central party leaders.102 The level of intrigue among Chinese leaders is so deep that important information is usually conveyed only in person or in writing. The police state in China is eating itself. Though this is not a phenomenon limited to China. Anyone who witnessed the fall of CIA Director David Petraeus may observe similar developments in the United States.103 Roughly a year after Wall Street Journal’s initial report on Amesys, Bahraini political activists started to receive rather blatant phishing e-mails. Researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab volunteered to analyze the malware payloads mailed to the activists and concluded that they were dealing with a component of the FinFisher framework known as FinSpy.104 To follow up on this discovery, Citizen Lab conducted a network scan for FinFisher command and control (C&C) servers and identified suspected servers in countries like Bahrain, Brunei, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).105 All told, researchers identified 25 governments with dubious human rights records using FinSpy.106 One tactic used by vendors is to disguise their malware as legitimate software.

In a report published by the Citizen Lab in May of 2013, researchers disclosed that they had identified samples of FinSpy that masqueraded as Mozilla’s Firefox browser.107 Mozilla responded by sending the vendor, Gamma International, a cease and desist letter.108 These kinds of events are hardly isolated. Within months of the FinSpy disclosure, one of the investigators involved in the Citizen Lab publication on the incident, a researcher named Morgan Marquis-Boire, came across yet another surveillance tool, one sold by Italian vendor Hacking Team, while investigating a cyber-attack on group of citizen journalists in Morocco. Furthermore, Marquis-Boire found that this same tool also happened to be used against a political dissident in the United Arab Emirates, who received a spear-phishing e-mail that installed Hacking Team’s malware.109 It’s not just foreign companies that are assisting the United Arab Emirates. U.S. defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, with the consent of U.S. intelligence, helped the sheikdom create its own signal intelligence processing infrastructure, largely based on the architecture used by the NSA.110 The implications fleshed out by Salon’s David Sirota are worth considering: American politicians who are financed by Booz and other firms with a similar multinational business model not only have a vested campaign-contribution interest in shilling for the domestic surveillance state that their donors profit from. They also have a similar interest in denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too.111 But it’s not just surveillance equipment. There’s also a burgeoning market for offensive software, commonly known as weaponized malware or cyberweapons. Malware that’s been weaponized is specially engineered so that it’s easy to delivery, remains stable and manageable in hostile environments, and reliably contaminates the target. These are also the very same qualities that distinguish a military-grade bioweapon from naturally occurring pestilence. A cyberweapon can be likened to a drink that’s been spiked. The average cyberweapon is concealed inside of legitimate input that’s fed to a software application. This input could be a web page, a Microsoft Office document, an Adobe PDF, etc. Having ingested the malicious payload, which is stashed inside the input data, the software application becomes sick. It enters a trancelike state where it will accept arbitrary commands dictated by the voodoo priest. It’s like something that you’d see in the 1932 Bela Lugosi movie White Zombie.

It enters a trancelike state where it will accept arbitrary commands dictated by the voodoo priest. It’s like something that you’d see in the 1932 Bela Lugosi movie White Zombie. The first component in the chain is the most crucial: the exploit. An exploit is a tiny series of instructions that takes advantage of an unpatched flaw (i.e. a bug) in targeted software. For example, if the cyberweapon is delivered by means of a web page, the exploit may be a malformed snippet of JavaScript which the web browser is unable to process correctly. The exploit leverages the software bug to sidestep existing defenses and gain entry. It’s like a burglar who finds a hole in the side of a vault and uses it to climb inside. Once inside the perimeter, the exploit launches the second stage of the cyberweapon. Typically this is what’s known as a dropper. A dropper is a kind of installer that sets up a base camp inside the infected computer for the cyberweapon’s third stage: the payload. The dropper unwraps the payload, perhaps downloading additional components from the Internet, sticks the payload somewhere, and then configures the target machine so that the payload can run. The payload can be anything: a monitoring module to capture passwords, a logic bomb that destroys data, a routing component that re-directs network traffic to help conceal an attack, or a combination of all of these. Payloads often contain something called a rootkit. A rootkit is essentially a stealth module, it’s a collection of special tools that allow the payload to run silently so that no one knows that it’s there.112 Many cyberweapons don’t explicitly try to conceal themselves. There are literally hundreds of moving pieces in the average operating system, so many that it’s pretty easy for a cyberweapon to hide in plain sight. So the presence of a rootkit is usually the hallmark of an advanced weapon. Of all of the cyberweapon elements in the chain of components, the exploit is the most valuable. This is because it takes specialized skills to identify new software bugs, bugs that the vendor often isn’t aware of, and after doing so determine a way to capitalize on them. An unpatched bug provides a way to attack computers that’s nearly impossible to defend against. U.S. agencies shell out big bucks for zero-day exploits in the black market.113 Intelligence services, in particular, are one of the most active buyers.114 The market thrives because of the U.S. government’s patronage.

For example, though the NSA designs and builds the bulk of its own malware, in 2013 it allocated over $25 million to purchase exploits in the private sector.115 Demand is so great that there are literally middlemen, like a South African fellow known only as “the Grugq,” who earns a good living funneling zero-day exploits from independent developers to U.S. intelligence services. The Grugq claims that he makes roughly 80 percent of his income selling to the U.S. government.118 The government also buys exploits directly from outfits like Endgame Systems, which sells exploits that typically fetch between $100, 000 and $200,000.119 Well-heeled organizations can purchase a combo-pack from Endgame Systems of 25 exploits for about $2.5 million.120 To help them locate computers to use these exploits on, Endgame sells a product called Bonesaw which maps out devices connected to the Internet (e.g. routers, servers, desktop PCs). Wired magazine offers the following description of how Bonesaw might be used in practice: The client locates a region on the password-protected webbased map, then picks a country and city – say, Beijing, China. Next the client types in the name of the target organization, such as the Ministry of Public Security’s No. 3 Research Institute, which is responsible for computer security – or simply enters It goes without saying that the traditional stalwarts of the defense industry like Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics have begun to establish a foothold in this market.122 As in the case of mass interception gear, many of the American vendors who sell offensive software are listed as sponsors at ISS World conferences. To leverage these exploits the government (with ample help from the private sector) sometimes builds its own malware payloads.123 We’ve already discussed canonical examples, like Stuxnet and Flame, which have been deployed oversees. But there are also offensive payloads that have been used by the security services domestically. For example, an offensive tracking application referred to as a Computer and Internet Protocol Address Verifier (CIPAV) has been deployed by the feds on multiple occasions via drive-by-download or a malicious e-mail.124 It’s particularly useful as a way to locate targets who are trying to hide behind proxy servers. The FBI has also, in what may be the ultimate eavesdropping tactic, been known to deploy malware that remotely enables the microphones on laptop computers and smart phones so that law enforcement can surreptitiously listen in on conversations that occur in the vicinity of the compromised devices.125 The market for cyberweapons in the United States reflects a larger reality.

The United States dwarfs the rest of the world in terms of arms sales. Despite the fact that civilian manufacturing has all but vanished and cities like Detroit have become ghost towns, in terms of exporting weapons that kill people and break stuff, this is one area where the United States stands head and shoulders above everyone else. As the New York Times reports: Law enforcement agencies need the most advanced IT intrusion research and the most reliable attack tools to covertly and remotely gain access to computer systems. Using previously unknown software vulnerabilities and exploits which bypass Antivirus products and modern operating system protections such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) could help investigators to successfully achieve this task. All client traffic is funneled through the ION network allowing the analyst in the U.S. to research and target enemy sites while appearing to originate from a foreign point of presence, in this case Cairo. The target website will never have reason to be suspicious of analyst visits, as all identifying HTTP information (location, operating system, language, etc.) will be appropriate and non-attributable to any U.S. entity. What the previous section demonstrates, at least indirectly, is that developing malware doesn’t require anywhere near as much overhead investment as conventional high-yield ordnance. Early work on intercontinental ballistic missiles in the late 1940s, for example, was so resource intensive that it necessitated the full backing of the federal government and thousands of specialists. At the SOURCE Boston 2010 conference, H.D. Moore announced that the source code base of the Metasploit Framework had surpassed the 100,000 line mark. This may seem like a lot of code but it’s actually a fairly manageable amount of logic (enterprise middleware suites often grow to be millions of lines of code in size). Also keep in mind that Moore’s brainchild started as an after-hours pet project.131 If a random collection of volunteers can produce a tool like Metasploit, imagine what a formally tasked squad of wellfunded, full-time, veteran engineers could crank out. Charlie Miller, a well-known expert in the field of exploit development, spent five years with the NSA before leaving for the corporate sector.

Given that the talent needed to build and deploy spy gear exists in abundance outside of the government, it isn’t much of a jump to presume that an autonomous group would be able to acquire the resources to execute their own black-bag operations. With enough money, you can recruit the people and purchase the tools needed to set up your own shop. This is the purview of the independent operator. The demand for private sector intelligence presents lucrative options for experienced intelligence officers looking for opportunities outside of the government. As mentioned earlier, private sector operations are not driven by love of country. They exist to benefit the bottom line, even if it means undermining democratic governments, trampling on civil rights, or supporting oligarchs. The same covert tactics are brought into action. The corporate espionage industry is deliberately hidden in a thicket of complex relationships designed to obscure just who is working for whom. Often, these firms are hired as subcontractors for corporate law firms and they argue that everything they do is covered by attorney-client privilege. Thus, their operations do not surface to the public.133 There’s at least one well-known example of a law firm enlisting hired guns. In October of 2009, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed to have acquired a trove of incriminating information from a hard drive belonging to an executive at Bank of America.134 The executives at Bank of America, fearing that this data would be released to the public, decided to act preemptively and, at the recommendation of the Department of Justice, went to an international law firm Hunton & Williams. The attorneys at Hunton & Williams, in turn, sought out hired guns. Specifically, they entertained a proposal submitted to them by Palantir Technologies, HBGary Federal, and Berico Technologies.135 The proposal described a collection of what could only be called strong-arm tactics. Specifically, it advised that WikiLeaks supporters in the press like Glenn Greenwald “if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause.” The proposal also recommended an expansive campaign of disinformation as well as head on cyber-attacks against the WikiLeaks infrastructure. The very idea of trying to threaten the careers of journalists and activists to punish and deter their advocacy is self-evidently pernicious; that it’s being so freely and casually proposed to groups as powerful as the Bank of America, the Chamber of Commerce, and the DOJ-recommended Hunton & Williams demonstrates", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:86:8b5e53284363", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3214, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "like Glenn Greenwald “if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause.” The proposal also recommended an expansive campaign of disinformation as well as head on cyber-attacks against the WikiLeaks infrastructure.

These highly experienced firms included such proposals because they assumed those deep-pocket organizations would approve and it would make their hiring more likely.136 This blueprint for corporate-sponsored coercion came to light in February of 2011 when the chief executive of HBGary Federal, Aaron Barr, threatened to reveal the identities of the Anonymous hacking collective. Anonymous retaliated by hacking into HBGary and stealing Barr’s e-mail, in addition to laying waste to the company’s website and backup data. For good measure, in a move that’s reminiscent of a professional wrestler’s choke slam, they wiped Barr’s iPad remotely. Using the corporate checking account to hire mercenaries isn’t necessarily a new idea. In 1850 Allen Pinkerton saw a business opportunity and formed the North-Western Police Agency. It grew into a veritable private army called the Pinkerton National Detective Agency that catered to business interests by infiltrating unions and breaking strikes. When normal groups of people tried to organize, protest, and assert their rights, the Pinkertons were there to enforce the status quo on behalf of the corporate interests that paid their substantial fee. In 1871 Congress set aside $50, 000 on behalf of the Department of Justice to create an organization dedicated to “the detection and prosecution of those guilty of violating federal law.” 138 This could have very well been the moment of inception for the FBI, but it wasn’t. In a move that should seem eerily familiar, political leaders at the time found it more expedient to outsource this work to the Pinkertons.139 The public-private entanglement continued on into the next century. For example, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), was a core component of the United States intelligence apparatus during World War II. It was disbanded in 1945 by President Harry Truman. Its successor, the CIA, didn’t formally come into existence until President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947. In the interim, OSS veterans like Allen Dulles and William Donovan were involved in the formation of a private spy organization that functioned under the auspices of a company called the World Commerce Corporation.140 In February of 2007, a holding company led by Erik Prince, the founder of Xe Services (the company formerly known as Blackwater USA), launched a private intelligence service out of Arlington, Virginia, and called it Total Intelligence Solutions (TIS).141 The company claimed to offer “the skills traditionally honed by CIA operatives directly", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:87:7471ebe28732", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3215, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "Allen Dulles and William Donovan were involved in the formation of a private spy organization that functioned under the auspices of a company called the World Commerce Corporation.140 In February of 2007, a holding company led by Erik Prince, the founder of Xe Services (the company formerly known as Blackwater USA), launched a private intelligence service out of Arlington, Virginia, and called it Total Intelligence Solutions (TIS).141 The company claimed to offer “the skills traditionally honed by CIA operatives directly to the board room.”142 At the time of its launch the company was chaired by Cofer Black. Included in its portfolio of services were “surveillance and counter surveillance, deployed intelligence collection, and rapid safeguarding of employees or other key assets.”143 In May of 2010, TIS apparently discontinued its corporate security information services.144 In February of 2011 the Guardian published a report that detailed how large corporate interests in Britain’s energy industry hired a “business risk management” firm named Vericola to secretly monitor environmental activists.145 Agents of Vericola attended campaign meetings, subscribed to mailing lists, and generally tried to ingratiate themselves with group members. Police have voiced concern that such private-sector actors are completely unregulated. According to the Washington Post’s Top Secret America project, there are over three hundred private sector companies that perform intelligence analysis, over a hundred companies capable of executing cyber operations, and at least fifty firms that handle human intelligence collection, raking in billions of dollars each year.146 With a couple of million dollars, the right equipment, and a handful of the right people, any group can launch an intelligence operation. Furthermore, information is a form of currency. Such groups may very well be driven by profit rather than an inherent sense of patriotism, making it difficult to depict cyber-espionage as a contest strictly driven by national interests. Spies exist to unearth sensitive information, often breaking laws in the process. That’s what they do: steal secrets. This is scarcely a domain where national governments have some sort of absolute monopoly, they just happen to employ agents who tend to be better funded and better organized. There’s no doubt that national governments have the resources to support extended campaigns. Yet, as the Russians can readily testify, sometimes criminals can effectively run their own long-running intelligence operations, especially when they’re using former government operatives.148 This will only serve to make attribution more problematic in the domain of cyber-attacks. When an incident takes place on a classified network, investigators cannot simply assume that it is the work of their opposite numbers on the other continent. The playing field is becoming more crowded. The usual state-sponsored teams are being joined by a broad spectrum of non-state actors, who are just as sophisticated, have access to the same technology, and possess their own peculiar motives for pilfering secrets.

While most national entities steal secrets under the rubric of national As mentioned earlier, it’s a matter of scale. There’s a big difference between monitoring a tiny fraction of a population and monitoring the entire population. Given the sheer amount of resources that the U.S. government channels to its intelligence apparatus, it should not come as a surprise that the scale of U.S. espionage dwarfs all other efforts. The U.S. spies with the eavesdropping equivalent of a nuclear weapon because of the money, the power, the technological capability of the U.S.. The NSA is the largest intelligence agency in the world. Other countries spy with the equivalent of a canon. One of the benefits the U.S. has is that the major Internet companies are located in the U.S. so they can put pressure on them to turn over information. Bamford’s assertions are also supported by an article that appeared in the Washington Post in early July of 2013. The report described elements of the NSA’s FAIRVIEW program,151 where the U.S. government got large foreign telecom providers (the companies that run fiber-optic cables across the oceans) into providing special access to U.S. intelligence. The security agreement for Global Crossing, whose fiber-optic network connected 27 nations and four continents, required the company to have a “Network Operations Center” on U.S. soil that could be visited by government officials with 30 minutes of warning. Surveillance requests, meanwhile, had to be handled by U.S. citizens screened by the government and sworn to secrecy – in many cases prohibiting information from being shared even with the company’s executives and directors.152 There are many more populations of non-adversarial countries which have been subjected to the same type of mass surveillance net by the NSA: indeed, the list of those which haven’t been are shorter than those which have. The claim that any other nation is engaging in anything remotely approaching indiscriminate worldwide surveillance of this sort is baseless.154 27) Barton Gellman and Greg Miller, $\" 0 . 5 .$ . spy network’s successes, failures and objectives detailed in ‘black budget’ summary,” Washington Post, August 29, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackbudget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_print.html. 33) House Intelligence Committee Launches Investigation into National Security Threats Posed by Chinese Telecom Companies Working in the U.S., Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, November 17, 2011, http://intelligence.house. gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/111711ChineseTelecom.pdf. 37) H.R. 933, “An Act making appropriations for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other departments and agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.’’", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:89:9338199040df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3217, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "spy network’s successes, failures and objectives detailed in ‘black budget’ summary,” Washington Post, August 29, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackbudget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_print.html. 33) House Intelligence Committee Launches Investigation into National Security Threats Posed by Chinese Telecom Companies Working in the U.S., Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, November 17, 2011, http://intelligence.house. gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/111711ChineseTelecom.pdf. 37) H.R. 933, “An Act making appropriations for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other departments and agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.’’ March 20, 2013, http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20130318/BILLS-113hr933eas.pdf. 72) James Clapper, Statement by Director of National Intelligence James R.

Such is the effect of dramatic predictions. Anxiety is a powerful tool because worried people can be encouraged to accept all kinds of solutions without critically scrutinizing their effectiveness or cost. But while the apocalypse appears at the edge of the event horizon and lurks as a constant threat, history tells a markedly different story of the threats we face and the degree of risk that they represent. In this chapter we’re going to look at high profile cyber incidents which have involved infrastructure components, with an initial emphasis on the United States. Given the nature of these events, we could have simply relegated them to Chapters 4 and 5. Instead we decided to group them into their own chapter because they’re a great lead-in to the concept of threat inflation. For example, On August 14 of 2013, the New York Times web site went offline. Fox Business published a story which claimed that the incident was the result of a cyber-attack.5 The New York Times apologized to readers later that day, explaining that the lapse in service was merely the result of a scheduled maintenance update on the company’s servers.6 In response to the outage, the satire mavens at the Onion posted the following message on Twitter: Our money supply is backed by “the full faith and credit” of the United States government. It’s been this way since 1971 when Nixon withdrew the United States from the Bretton Woods system and got us off the gold standard. Consequently, most people’s financial assets and debts are nothing more than bytes stored in high-end mainframes.

If an attacker were somehow able to challenge the underlying trust that people have in the financial markets, or the banking system, by subverting the integrity of these bytes, people would lose faith and the global economy would face trouble. The United States economy is $14 trillion a year. Two banks in New York City move $7 trillion a day. On a good day, they do eight trillion. Now think about that. Our economy is $14 trillion. Two banks are moving $7 trillion to $8 trillion a day. There is no gold; they’re not even printed dollar bills. All of those transactions, all those transactions are massive reconciliation and accounting. If those who wish us ill, if someone with a different world view was successful in attacking that information and destroying the data, it could have a devastating impact, not only on the nation, but the globe. In late 2010 the company that runs the NASDAQ stock exchange, NASDAQ OMX Group, discovered “suspicious files” on servers that run a web-based application called Directors Desk, a platform designed to allow NASDAQ clients to share non-public information. Initially the incident was handled by the Secret Service. Later on the FBI took over as the lead investigative agency, and eventually the NSA also became involved.7 Investigators were surprised to find some computers with outof-date software, misconfigured firewalls and uninstalled security patches that could have fixed known “bugs” that hackers could exploit. Versions of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 2003 Server operating system, for example, had not been properly updated.11 Web servers seem to be a popular attack vector because they’re publicly accessible. In 1999 NASDAQ’s website was defaced by vandals, with little or no effect on trading systems.13 This is not something that’s limited to the United States either. On August 5, 2011, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange was forced to shut down its website after it was breached by intruders. Note that this did not hamper trading systems.14 On August 10, 2011, the news web site maintained by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. was attacked. Again, the impact on trading was strictly limited. The company suspended afternoon trading for seven companies that had published price-sensitive news releases during the exchange’s lunch break.15 This doesn’t mean that the core systems that run exchanges haven’t gone down. It’s just that in the past when they’ve gone offline it’s not been the result of cyber-attacks.

One unnamed chief executive provided the following comment: If there’s one segment of the financial infrastructure that invests in contingency planning and disaster recovery it’s our central bank: the U.S. Federal Reserve. For example, on April 8, 1991, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve got a chance to put its disaster recovery plan to the test. In the wee hours of the morning a water pipe burst, flooding the building in the vicinity of its mainframe. Within minutes, in a move which has no known historical rival, disaster recovery procedures were initiated. By 3 : 00 A.M . employees re-grouped, suitcases in hand, for deployment via charter flight to the backup site in Virginia. By noon electronic wire transfer service was restored, ten hours ahead of the disaster plan.17 These are obviously folks who plan ahead. Hot backups, redundant network links, and split operational models (where workloads can be absorbed by distinct production systems in the event of failure) are par for the course. History seems to reflect this emphasis on security and availability as there have been very few recorded penetrations. In October of 2010, a 32-year-old Malaysian national named Lin Mun Poo was taken into custody by Secret Service Agents as he arrived at JFK International Airport in New York. Among other crimes, he was charged with breaching a network of ten computers run by the Cleveland Federal Reserve. Prosecutors claimed the attack did thousands of dollars of damage. According to a report by NBC News: June Gates, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve in Cleveland, said the penetration was restricted to a network of “test” computers used for checking out new software and applications and did not contain sensitive Federal Reserve data about banks in the region. She declined, however, to respond to questions about whether Federal Reserve officials were aware of the hacking attack when it occurred in June – or only learned about it last month after Secret Service agents seized Poo’s computer.18 Ostensibly credible authorities on National Security matters have publicly and vocally warned that our economy will nosedive if hackers undermine our financial infrastructure. That’s a mighty big if, given that most of the hacking incidents involving the stock exchanges or the Federal Reserve have generated little if any longterm economic disruption.

In fact, viewing these incidents from the vantage point of the 2008 mortgage crisis, which led the Federal Reserve to commit around $7.7 trillion19 to rescue our financial system (more than half of our entire annual GDP), it’s probably more accurate to conclude that a handful of prominent U.S. banking interests represent far greater systemic risk to our financial system than any outside agents have.20 Federal investigators admit as much: After the banks, the power grid is another popular target for hypothetical attacks. In April of 2008, the Wall Street Jourclaimed that other nations have navigated their way through our grid, leaving malicious software which could be activated in the event of hostilities.24 The unnamed official claimed: To give you an idea just how weak the evidence is behind this threat, in early 2012 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report entitled CYBERSECURITY: Challenges in Securing the Modernized Electricity Grid.25 The report, which is 19 pages in length, strikes a very grim tone. Or, at least, it attempts to. There’s only one problem, which George Smith points out: The first is Stuxnet, which was used to attack Iran’s uranium-enrichment program and which is thought to be a joint creation of U.S. and Israeli intelligence. Stuxnet did not turn off the power in Iran. And most reasonable minds have now concluded that Iran has purged Stuxnet from the targeted systems. It’s as if people believe that somewhere in a cramped, windowless, government office there’s a big red switch that shuts everything off. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our national power grid is a labyrinth of local subsystems. Roughly 1,600 providers in the United States generate bulk electricity at, or higher than, the 100 kilovolt level.27 How difficult would it be to put all of these providers out of business in one fell swoop? For instance, in November of 2009, the television news show 60 Minutes broadcast a story entitled “Cyber War: Sabotaging the System.” In this episode, 60 Minutes reported that “prominent” unnamed members of the intelligence community blamed cyber-attacks for a power outage in Brazil that occurred in 2007. The power outage in question, which took place in the state of Espirito Santo on September 26, lasted for two days and impacted over 3 million people. Yet, according to Furnas Centrais Elétricas, the region’s utility company, the outage was the result of high-voltage insulators on a 345-kilovolt line being covered with soot as nearby farmers burned their fields. This conclusion was later confirmed by", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:93:33b442014d70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3221, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "the intelligence community blamed cyber-attacks for a power outage in Brazil that occurred in 2007.

This conclusion was later confirmed by the Brazilian independent systems operator group.31 Oliveira and Geraldes further ruled out the possibility of hackers because, following some acknowledged interferences in past years, GOB has closed the system to only a small group of authorized operators, separated the transmission control system from other systems, and installed filters. Coimbra confirmed that the ONS system is a CLAN network using its own wires carried above the electricity wires. Oliveira pointed out Coimbra said that while sabotage could have caused the outages, this type of disruption would have been deadly, and investigators would have found physical evidence, including the body of the perpetrator. He also noted that any internal attempts by system employees to disrupt the system would have been easily traceable, a fact known to anyone with access to the system.32 You may notice, right in the beginning, there’s mention of “acknowledged interferences in past years.” According to Wired, back around 2006 some Eastern European hackers breached a machine at a government agency in Brazil that was configured with a default password.33 The intruders copied some files, deleted the originals, and then demanded ransom for the data’s return. In June of 2000, California suffered from a series of rolling blackouts. In the winter and spring of 2001 more rolling blackouts hit California. These outages, which impacted millions of people, were not the result of hacking. The blackouts were a result of California’s deregulation of its electric utility industry in 1996 and subsequent market manipulation by companies like Enron.34 According to Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy from 1998 to 2001: in Bluffdale, Utah, suffered a series of 10 show-stopping electrical meltdowns over a 13 month period.36 These meltdowns have delayed the datacenter’s opening for a year as investigators scrambled for months to isolate their origin. Each incident is reported to have destroyed as much as $100, 000 in equipment. n the aftermath of the Iraq invasion the U.S. Department of I Commerce stated that more than half of the telephone lines in Baghdad were out of service.37 Re-reading this sentence you could just as easily see the glass as half full and gain an appreciation for just how much effort would be required to silence all the phones.

Despite the warnings that officials make about the Chinese company Huawei, with its alleged ties to the PLA, there aren’t that many documented instances (outside of direct military action) where aggressors have incapacitated a telecom network. There have, however, been recorded incidents of vandalism. For example, in April of 2009, someone cut a bunch of fiber optic cables in the California cities of San Jose and San Carlos. Service for tens of thousands of customers was offline for roughly 12 hours.38 But even then the shock and awe was lacking, so to speak. As a Verizon spokeswoman remarked: The knee-jerk response for many people was to assume the worst-case scenario: foreign spies had succeeded in penetrating our drone program to subvert its missions. Conversely, other security researchers postulated that it might be a legitimate monitoring package quietly deployed by the Defense Department to keep tabs on the rank and file. It turns out that the virus in question was garden-variety malware originally built to target the credentials of users who play online games.41 As such, it had no real impact on drone-related software. It found its way on to the GCS machines via a portable hard drive used to transfer data between systems. • On October 20, 2007, Landsat-7, a U.S. earth observation satellite jointly managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey, experienced 12 or more minutes of interference. This interference was only discovered following a similar event in July 2008 (see below). • On June 20, 2008, Terra EOS [earth observation system] AM–1, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration-managed program for earth observation, experienced two or more minutes of interference.‡ The responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands. Was the interference the result of actions taken on behalf of hostile foreign powers? Perhaps it was user error or a software glitch? Maybe this was actually just the handiwork of a third-party integrator on vacation with his family in Russia? The report leans towards China as the culprit, asserting that the events are in line with Chinese military papers that promote the subversion of satellite control facilities. Some cyber-attacks get attention because the target is prominent the truth is that Distributed Denial of Service (aka DDoS) attacks, which attempt to overwhelm Internet servers with torrents of network traffic, are some of the most popular and simplest attacks.

The end result of a DDoS attack is the suspension of network-based services for a period of time, often for a few hours or days. While time sensitive businesses (e.g. online betting) are the most vulnerable to this kind of attack, other targets don’t necessarily suffer catastrophic losses. Let’s look at a couple of the more recent examples. In late April and early May of 2007, a series of DDoS attacks flooded the country of Estonia after it moved a statue dedicated to Russian soldiers who died fighting the Nazis. Estonians see this statue as a reminder of the authoritarian government which took over after kicking the Germans out. The BBC covered this story with a title that read Estonia hit by “Moscow cyber war.”43 Accusations flew in the wake of the Estonia attacks. The country’s Prime Minister, Andrus Ansip, claimed that the Russian government was directly responsible. There was even talk among Estonian decision makers of invoking Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to drag other NATO countries into the fray.44 In August of 2008, Georgia came under DDoS attacks during military engagement with Russian troops. The New York Times published an article about this entitled Georgia Takes a Beating in the Cyberwar with Russia.46 More than 50 web sites were kicked to the sidelines by a flood of network traffic. The attackers, who were using a modified tool from Microsoft that’s normally used to stress-test web servers, targeted government and media sites initially and then expanded their scope to include financial institutions. The disruption was effective enough that the National Bank of Georgia was offline for 10 days.47 The U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit,48 a non-profit research institute, looked into this.49 They concluded that the attack was orchestrated by civilians who recruited participants and exchanged logistical information using social networking tools like Twitter and Facebook. Because the DDoS attacks appear to have been closely timed with operations on the ground, investigators suspect that there may have been coordination between the cyber attackers and the Russian military. The inquiry also examined botnet activity involved in the DDoS attack and traced back the corresponding command and control traffic to web sites registered in Turkey and Russia. These sites were set up using stolen American identification. The servers that hosted the command and control web sites had previously been used by criminal elements.

The Wall Street Journal mentioned this incident in a report titled “Winning a Cyber War.” Again the war meme permeates the media’s coverage. There were several theories put forward as to the motivation for the attacks, which were allegedly executed by a Russian cyber-militia. For example, reporters suspected that the attack was intended to stymie political opposition that relied heavily on the Internet to reach the public.50 On the Fourth of July, 2009, a DDoS attack hit U.S. and South Korean networks. Researchers from Bkis Security in Hanoi discovered that the attack involved over 166,000 machines spread across 74 different countries. The master command and control server that coordinated these compromised machines was originally traced to the UK.51 In a press release, the British company that owns this server, Global Digital Broadcast, stated that: To an extent, Hoekstra’s saber rattling is a predictable. A series of research studies at San Francisco State University after 9/11 demonstrated that participants who externalized blame for an attack were more likely to support a military response, while those participants more inclined towards introspection were less likely.55 Twenty months later, on March 4, 2011, South Korea once again came under a DDoS attack. The incident was investigated by McAfee,56 which dubbed the attack “10 Days of Rain.” As in the earlier 2009 episode, the DDoS attack targeted web sites run by South Korea and the United States. In fact, over a third of the sites attacked this time around were also targeted in the previous 2009 campaign. The attack was executed using a botnet based in South Korea. The malware that infected individual hosts was heavily armored to discourage static forensic analysis. Investigators view this as a gambit to buy time and allow the DDoS attack to run its course. The malware supported dynamic updates and was programmed to self-destruct after ten days, taking down the host computer with it by overwriting the host’s master boot record (MBR). Botnet members communicated with over 40 command and control servers spread out over 19 countries. The topology they implemented exposed a certain degree of architectural sophistication. Command and control servers were organized using a multi-tier architecture to facilitate scalability and make the botnet more difficult to decapitate. Despite the conspicuous nature of the attack, attribution wasn’t achieved.

Despite the conspicuous nature of the attack, attribution wasn’t achieved. McAfee investigators speculate that the relatively high level of technical expertise exhibited by the developers coupled with the hard-coded self-destruct mechanism indicates that the attacks may have been a test run that was intended to evaluate South Korea’s ability to defend itself. McAfee’s VP of threat research, Dmitri Alperovitch, suggested that North Korea might be the culprit.57 However, as usual, hard evidence is lacking. If DDoS attacks are indeed interpreted as acts of war, then McAfee has got some explaining to do. In April of 2010 McAfee distributed a buggy update to its antivirus suite, causing tens of thousands of computers running Windows XP Service pack 3 to treat the service host process (i.e. SVCHOST.EXE) as malware and quarantine/ delete it. This file, it just so happens, is required for Windows to operate normally. Machines all over the Internet blue-screened, shut down, and generally acted out.58 In September of 2012 a number of U.S. commercial banks were hit with a salvo of DDoS attacks. The banks targeted included big names like Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, and Wells Fargo. James Lewis of the CSIS, acting as if he were some sort of emissary, was quoted in the New York Times as claiming that the U.S. government believed that Iran was behind the attacks.60 Though no substantial proof has been provided that backs up this accusation. As you might expect, the attacks were often characterized as “unprecedented” in terms of their sophistication. Other experts have disputed this, as the attackers used plain old commodity malware to compromise datacenters, using cloud-based platforms to create large volumes of traffic.61 All told, the attacks generated media buzz but that’s about it. No accounts were compromised, no customers lost their money, and nobody was killed. If this was payback for Stuxnet, we’re not that impressed. Freelance journalist Constantine von Hoffman remarked: Iran is a country with a nuclear program. Is this the best the Iranian intelligence agencies can do? Or maybe Iran isn’t responsible. Strictly speaking, a troupe of hackers called “Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters” claimed responsibility for the attack. The group declared that the DDoS attacks were executed in protest of the anti-Islam movie The Innocence of Muslims. The Times reported that American intelligence officials believed this group to be a front organization created by the Iranian government.63 A recent high-profile DDoS attack took place in late March of 2013, when a non-profit organization called Spamhaus was hit by what might have been the largest publicly known DDoS attack (somewhere on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:98:b3f6cb5a118f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3226, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 99, "text": "al-Qassam Cyber Fighters” claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Times reported that American intelligence officials believed this group to be a front organization created by the Iranian government.63 A recent high-profile DDoS attack took place in late March of 2013, when a non-profit organization called Spamhaus was hit by what might have been the largest publicly known DDoS attack (somewhere on the order of 300 gigabits per second).64 Spamhaus, as its name suggests, tracks organizations on the Internet that send junk emails en masse (i.e. spam). The DDoS attack began after Spamhaus observed a Dutch company, CyberBunker, hosting spammers and subsequently put CyberBunker on its e-mail blacklist. This blacklist is widely distributed to email providers so that they can screen out spam before it reaches user mailboxes. This means that email emanating from CyberBunker’s network will, in most cases, never reach its intended destination, as it will be intercepted as spam. Let’s look at some technical aspects of the DDoS attack. A key ingredient was the misuse of DNS servers. DNS servers perform name resolution, so that computers hooked up to the Internet can locate resources online. For example, when you type www.google.com into a browser, it’s a DNS server that takes the string www.google.com and locates the physical servers hosting Google’s web site. It’s one thing to place a take-out pizza order and have them send the pizza to your home address. It’s another to place a few million bogus orders to someone else’s address. In a nutshell, this is what the attackers did. They made millions of requests to DNS servers all over the Internet and had the response to those requests (i.e. the pizza, so to speak) sent to Spamhaus. By analogy, attackers found a way to re-route the response of a DNS query so that it was forwarded to the target. To direct the response of a DNS query to the victim of a DDoS attack, the attacker spoofs their IP address so that the initial request appears to be originating from the victim (see Figure 7-2). Get an entire botnet to make this kind of request and the targeted network is flooded with a torrent of phony DNS responses. To add insult to injury, the Spamhaus DDoS attack relied on what’s known as DNS amplification, where the attacker sends a small query to a DNS server which then responds with a much larger response. This effectively amplifies the amount of data in transit. One way to stifle DNS amplification DDoS would be to shut down all of the open DNS resolvers on the Internet. Another, less drastic solution, would be to configure these DNS servers so that they didn’t respond to requests originating from a spoofed IP address. The steps needed to do so were spelled", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:99:b075bed54572", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3227, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "the attacker sends a small query to a DNS server which then responds with a much larger response.

Another, less drastic solution, would be to configure these DNS servers so that they didn’t respond to requests originating from a spoofed IP address. The steps needed to do so were spelled out years ago in a document known as Best Current Practice #38 (BCP38).66 Many companies simply decided not spend the resources to implement these steps. So, here it is, allegedly one of the most prolific DDoS attacks of all time. Granted it did cause some temporary congestion among a handful of Internet exchanges,67 but it didn’t force the Internet to a grinding halt. In fact, a spokesperson from NTT, one of the backbone providers on the Internet, placidly stated: Recall earlier in the book we discussed Thomas Rid’s criteria for acts of war: they must be violent, instrumental, and political. While many of the DDoS attacks we’ve surveyed may have been politically motivated and were instrumental to reach certain goals, the damage incurred does not measure up to the violence in traditional warfare nor the capabilities of other cyber-attack methods. Despite the media’s annoying tendency to print headlines that label these incidents as acts of war, the absence of real violence is palpable. Compare, if you will, the Estonia DDoS attacks against the fire-bombing of Dresden in World War II. DDoS attacks, as a rule, result in a negligible amount of physical damage; though they definitely generate news coverage. The bombing of Dresden leveled the city and killed over 20,000 people. In terms of dollars lost, some of the most damaging DDoS attacks occur in the online gambling industry.72 Can you imagine how much money bookies would lose if they were unable to function during the Super Bowl or the World Cup? Once more, because online gambling is a legally sticky issue in the United States, operations are often forced to defend themselves and may be incline to simply pay for “protection” rather than hire the talent necessary to fend off DDoS attacks. In that sense, we are talking about cybercrime rather than cyberwar. With the right equipment and skillset, however, it’s entirely viable to sustain network operations and mitigate a DDoS attack. This is exactly what the online gambling operations do; they hire specialists and invest in the necessary technology. Once more, there are well-known name brand companies like CloudFlare and Prolexic which openly sell protection against DDoS attacks as a core business service.

Starting on March 24, 2010, when certain Internet users in the United States and Chile attempted to connect to popular social networking websites, their computers requested routine Internet Protocol information, and a Beijing-based Domain Name Server (a clone-like iteration of a Swedish root server) replied with faulty responses. As a result, these users were directed to incorrect servers, as if the users were trying to access restricted content from behind China’s Great Firewall. These conditions persisted in some cases for several days before the administrators of the Sweden based root server temporarily disabled requests to their Beijing server “clone.” routing all traffic to about 15 percent of the Internet’s destinations through servers located in China. This incident affected traffic to and from U.S. government (‘‘.gov’’) and military (‘‘. mil’’) sites, including those for the Senate, the army, the navy, the marine corps, the air force, the office of secretary of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and many others. Certain commercial websites were also affected, such as those for Dell, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and IBM.76 This level of access could enable surveillance of specific users or sites. It could disrupt a data transaction and prevent a user from establishing a connection with a site. It could even allow a diversion of data to somewhere that the user did not intend (for example, to a ‘‘spoofed’’ site). Arbor Networks Chief Security Officer Danny McPherson has explained that the volume of affected data here could have been intended to conceal one targeted attack. Perhaps most disconcertingly, as a result of the diffusion of Internet security certification authorities, control over diverted data could possibly allow a telecommunications firm to compromise the integrity of supposedly secure encrypted sessions. n the 1980s, it wasn’t unusual to see physicist Edward Teller at press conferences warning of an existential threat: a large meteor hitting the earth", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:101:927b47a69e78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3229, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "Security Officer Danny McPherson has explained that the volume of affected data here could have been intended to conceal one targeted attack.

This worst case scenario (which was later explored by a number of Holly wood blockbusters) was a sales pitch for a nuclear-powered energy weapon he had developed called the _(x) -ray laser. Teller had earlier tried to promote his invention as a way to combat the Soviet threat in space, but with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s he needed a new use for it. Meteor strikes that precipitate mass extinction are exceedingly rare. They are prototypical black swan events. Yet witness a respected, world-renowned, scientist blatantly exaggerating the danger in an effort to produce a sense of alarm which any insurance actuary would laugh at. There’s a name for this phenomenon, it is called threat inflation.2 Threat inflation works because humans are irrational. As Charles Mackay documented in his book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, humans are fundamentally emotional creatures who succumb to primitive irrational impulses. When confronted with doomsday scenarios the average person rarely stops to perform a careful assessment or to consider the presence of ulterior motives. Most people tacitly accept the speakers’ authority (given that most of them are former high-ranking officials) and take the story at somewhere near face value. According to Mencken, the goal is to generate anxiety, to instill a profound sense of apprehension, so that the public is receptive to preconceived solutions. Psychological research has shown that anxious people will choose to be safe rather than sorry. In the throes of an alleged crisis, anxious people aren’t particular about the solution as long as it is presented as a preventative measure; they don’t care much about the cost, as they are willing to pay a steep price to feel safe again. yberwar proponents often have long-standing relationships Cwith the corporate entities that serve the defense industry. Mike McConnell is a classic example of this. He served as the director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1992 to 1996. After retiring from the NSA in 1996, McConnell took a job with a company called Booz Allen Hamilton, where he rose to the level of senior vice president. According to an article in The New Yorker, he was making about $2 million a year.4 According to the Top Secret America project, spearheaded by the likes of Dana Priest and Bill Arkin, Booz maintains a head count of over 23,000 employees and reports", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:102:e601e8d66228", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3230, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "National Security Agency (NSA) from 1992 to 1996.

Booz Allen made more the $3 billion in defense contracts from 1998 to 2003, where the contracts awarded increased on average by about $100 million each year.9 Almost $800 million of these proceeds were from no-bid contracts, over half of which were related to national security. Given Booz Allen’s role in the creation of CY-BERCOM,10 it’s obvious that this close level of involvement with the military has continued. In March of 2013 Booz Allen, which is ranked 436 on the Fortune 500, reported annual revenues of $5.76 billion, with the government providing 98 percent of these proceeds.11 Contractors like Booz Allen can make a lot of money if the United States government decides that massive retaliation or Big Brother is the way to realize cyber-security. Do you suppose there may be a conflict of interest? Even if McConnell comes from the most patriotic orientation and harbors the most genuine intent to protect the nation that he loves, a human mind is not the best equipment to separate all that from the vested interest that would benefit him and his employer. We have no way of knowing how people like Mr. McConnell formed their business relationships, and what agreements or compromises they might have made to get their private-sector jobs (and vice versa). They may be honorable men, but as recent history has shown us, there’s no reason to take them at their word. And the current one-year ban on lobbying for former officials does little to prevent conflicts of interest.12 Would it surprise you to discover that Mikulski sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as the Appropriations Committee?

According to Maryland’s Department of Business and Economic Development, the state ranks second with regard to federal research and development spending ( $13.3 billion).14 Could Senator Mikulski have reasons, outside of raw patriotism, for depicting current developments as acts of war? Stepping back, do you suppose that this raises questions about the role that for-profit business interests play in the U.S. intelligence apparatus? Does the potential for a conflict of interest exist when approximately 70 percent of the national intelligence budget is spent on what’s essentially a “Digital Blackwater”?15 The potential for waste and graft are substantial. A number of contracting firms were involved in what’s known as the Trailblazer project. Trailblazer was an initiative originally formulated in 2001 by the NSA to allow analysts to sift through the tidal wave of phone calls and e-mails that they collected every day. The goal was to allow end-users to identify useful patterns (as opposed to capturing everything, which isn’t feasible anymore). Under the leadership of General Michael Hayden, the Trailblazer project lasted several years and consumed $1.2 billion in funding. The NSA, however, was unable to deploy an operational system and the project was declared a complete failure by the NSA’s inspector general. Though the contractors involved in the project would probably beg to differ, for them it was a welcome payday. Congress was so appalled by what happened that they took away the NSA’s authority to handle major contracts.18 There are huge corporate forces with a vested financial interest in making sure the debate over security is tilted toward the surveillance state and against critics of that surveillance state. In practice, that means when those corporations spend big money on campaign contributions, they aren’t just buying votes for specific private contracts. They are also implicitly pressuring politicians to rhetorically push the discourse in a pro-surveillance, anti-civil liberties direction – that is, in a direction that preserves the larger political assumptions on which the profits of the entire surveillance-industrial complex are based.19 A man named Chris Pyle can also offer a degree of insight into the quagmire of public-private entanglement, from a slightly different angle. Pyle is an old-school whistleblower from the 1970s who exposed an extensive surveillance program run by the CIA and Army Intelligence while working as an instructor for the Army. Pyle revealed a massive effort to track Americans who were involved in lawful political activity. Pyle recalls: There were about 1,500 Army agents in plain clothes watching every demonstration in the United States of 20 people or more.

Pyle recalls: There were about 1,500 Army agents in plain clothes watching every demonstration in the United States of 20 people or more. There was also a records system in a giant warehouse on about six million people. I disclosed the existence of that surveillance and then recruited 125 of the Army’s counterintelligence agents to tell what they knew about the spying to Congress, the courts and the press. As a result of those disclosures and the congressional hearings, the entire U.S. Army Intelligence Command was abolished.21 Many people believe that they have nothing to fear from government/corporate surveillance because they have nothing to hide. But every bureaucracy is a solution in search of a problem, and if it can’t find a problem to fit its solution, they will redefine the problem. In the 1960s, the surveillance bureaucracies redefined anti-war and civil rights protests as communist enterprises; today the same bureaucracies redefine anti-war Quakers, environmentalists, and animal rights activists as “terrorists.” So political activists, no matter how benign, have good reasons to fear these bureaucracies.22 When genuine threats are in short supply, faced with financial pressure certain elements in U.S. security services will create new ones. This is a documented phenomenon that’s part of the public record; the tendency for citizens engaged in political activity to end up as targets of monitoring. This kind of repression has taken place in the 1960s (e.g. the FBI’s COINTELPRO and the CIA’s Operation CHAOS), during the Invasion of Iraq,23 and during the Occupy Wall Street protests.24 By taking an apocalyptic event and treating it as if was “imminent,” society enters a logic-free zone dominated by emotion that clouds our ability to reason. This puts the economic and political imperatives of special interests before our own. As we mentioned earlier, an existential threat like Cybergeddon can justify any cost in the throes of a crisis mentality. It’s a dangerous mindset, one that can be extremely wasteful because it draws us away from logical risk assessment. If society is going to consider Cybergeddon, however remote the possibility, why not do so in a manner that’s focused primarily on safeguarding us from immediate and tangible threats? Society needs to consider solutions that will mitigate direct threats (i.e. cybercrime, espionage, etc.) without completely dismissing the hypothetical ones.

Once an incident is detected in the wild, investigators turn to the discipline of computer forensics to determine how questions like: When did the attack occur? How was the attack executed? Were assets compromised? Who was behind the attack? It’s this last question, the quest to assign attribution that we will focus on in this chapter. In an attempt to identify perpetrators, investigators will consider the nature of the data that the intruders were targeting and the organization that owns it. They’ll inspect the time-frame of the attacks to see if there’s a correlation with other major events. Investigators will also try to recognize attack signatures by inspecting the tools that attackers used (e.g. exploits, payloads, and the delivery mechanism), the actions that attackers took once they gained a foothold inside the internal network, and the evidence that the attackers left behind. The problem with IP addresses is that they’re not necessarily a useful identifier as far as human actors are concerned. An IP address designates a device, not a person. It’s bad enough just trying to associate a person with a device, sometimes it’s not even possible to associate a given IP address with a specific device. The incidental admissions published in government reports and offhand remarks made by security professionals in the press reflect this state of affairs. In 2009, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the U.S. Government, continued to be the target of intrusions that appear to have originated within the PRC. These intrusions focused on exfiltrating information, some of which could be of strategic or military utility. The accesses and skills required for these intrusions are similar to those necessary to conduct computer network attacks. It remains unclear if these intrusions were conducted by, or with the endorsement of, the PLA or other elements of the PRC government.1 Attribution is probably one of the biggest problems for our nation, both from a defensive and an offensive posture as a country. Obviously we know that the likes of China and Russia have the greatest capabilities, like the U.S., from an espionage perspective. But we are starting to see quite a capability in the organized crime, criminal aspect.2 Contrary to what some people might tell you,3 simply going to a coffee shop with a dedicated laptop/tablet and using the free wireless access will not provide reliable anonymity.

For an attacker it will more likely result in jail time. Not only will investigators be able to trace back the network traffic to a distinct geographic location, but they may very well be able to use existing close circuit camera footage to literally catch the intruder in the act. Starbucks franchises tend to be located in high traffic business zones were cameras are prevalent. Once more, if the attacker gets comfortable and makes a habit of using the same coffee shop access point they also risk establishing a pattern that can eventually be leveraged against them. One way to foil geographic attribution is to piggyback on a poorly secured wireless network from a distance. RadioLabs sells a number of high-gain omni-directional antennas, like the WaveRV Marine XL,4 which fit the bill. On a busy street it’s likely that there will be at least one unsecured wireless router that an attacker can use as a gateway. Or, there may be access points that are secured with older protocols, like WEP or LEAP, which can be compromised with automated tools. Nota Bene: shrewd operators recognize the all-too-real hazards of data correlation. They work clean. During a job they pay for everything in cash (to avoid leaving a credit card paper trail) and leave all other electronic devices at home. Cell phones and other wireless gadgets are essentially tracking devices. Another way attackers subvert attribution is to rely on what’s known as a highly anonymous proxy server. A proxy is just a computer somewhere out on the Internet that receives network requests and forwards them in such a way that they appear to originate from the proxy rather than the original computer. As an extra measure, it’s not unheard of for security-conscious users to set up an encrypted Secure Shell (SSH) connection between their client computer and the proxy in an effort to protect traffic that they send to the proxy. This may explain why attackers have been known to build their own ad-hoc proxy servers. When attackers gain entry to an internal network, they’ll sometimes use the initially compromised machine as a proxy of sorts from which they can scan and attack other systems. The motivating idea behind this is that it allows the attacker to pick the low-hanging fruit, perhaps a desktop system used by the receptionist, and then move laterally towards more attractive targets, which themselves may also become proxies. This practice is known as pivoting and it is a feature supported by penetration testing frameworks like CORE IMPACT and Metasploit.

This practice is known as pivoting and it is a feature supported by penetration testing frameworks like CORE IMPACT and Metasploit. Criminals have proven that they can utilize this tactic effectively. For instance, in December of 2012 the Japanese National Police Agency ( Japan’s version of the FBI) announced a reward of $36, 000 for information leading to the arrest of a miscreant who was posting gruesome warnings at popular Japanese bulletin board about mass killings at an elementary school. The perpetrator used compromised machines to post these messages, and police mistakenly arrested four innocent people before they realized what was going on.6 The general strategy, of blindly forwarding traffic through several intermediary machines, has been technically refined into a process known as onion routing. With a single proxy server there’s always the threat that an investigator will subpoena log data from the ISP and use it to home in on an attacker’s geographic location. By onion routing through a cloud of zombies, spread out over several continents, the probability of geo-location is significantly diminished. We’ll explore onion routing again in the section on government-funded efforts. Another thing that attackers are mindful of, especially during initial reconnaissance, is that the configuration of his computer can be used to construct a profile that uniquely identifies him. Web browsers, in particular, are susceptible to being fingerprinted by inspecting the meta-data they transmit to web servers during a HTTP conversation.7 This includes stuff like the fonts that are installed, the host operating system, language settings, plug-ins, and so forth. To minimize the amount of information revealed, an attacker will stick to a widely available browser without installing any plugins, add-ons, or extensions. An attacker might completely disable Javascript, disable automatic image loading (e.g. JPGs, GIFs, etc), and configure the browser not to maintain extraneous information (e.g. browsing history, cache data, cookies, etc.). Many of the popular browsers, like Firefox, offer privacy browsing modes that limit how much data they persist. An attacker can test their browser configuration to see how it ranks. The Electronic Frontier Foundation hosts a site called Panopticlick which examines a browser’s meta-data to calculate how unique its configuration is.8 As an experiment, perform a series of runs with this web-based tool, gradually disabling browser functionality to see what sort of gains can be achieved. When it comes to anonymity, less is more. Then there’s the matter of forensic artifacts left behind on an attacker’s computer (e.g. cached temporary files, browser cookies).

If the computer is seized, all of these traces can be fairly damning evidence. Manually scrubbing with secure file deletion tools and disk wiping utilities is one approach. But this requires consistent operational discipline. Why take chances? To hedge a bet, an attacker can launch their online session from an operating system that’s loaded from a bootable CD. This way the OS files are guaranteed to be pristine with every system restart. The idea is to prevent forensic data from surviving the session. Any artifacts created will vanish once the machine shuts down, as most live CDs execute from an artificial system drive that’s carved out of memory. There are live distributions that are specially tailored to enhance anonymity, like The Amnesiac Incognito Live System (TAILS). An effective approach is one that relies on defense in depth. That is, combine tactics for better security. For example, an attacker can launch a network session from a laptop that boots from a TAILS CD and employs a high-gain antenna to communicate with an open wireless access point, which then routes traffic to a proxy server in another country which is linked to a command and control server managing a botnet that’s providing an anonymity service. Even a veteran network security engineer would be hard-pressed to track a person using this sort of multi-tiered strategy. For users with an actual budget, there are all-in-one commercial subscription-based services like Ntrepid’s Internet Operations Network (ION). ION offers what they refer to as operational non-attribution (i.e. a sexed-up way of saying anonymity). The company maintains a veritable cloud of rotating IP addresses which utilizes multiple levels of indirection to conceal the identity of its subscribers, most of whom are likely government agents involved in open source intelligence collection. Ntrepid has already put its technology to use on behalf of the U.S. Central Command. As part of the military’s Operation Earnest Voice (OEV), a PSYOP campaign initially launched during the invasion of Iraq, Ntrepid was awarded a $2.76 million contract to develop software that would allow the Pentagon to disseminate propaganda via social media web sites.9 The so-called “online persona management service,” known as MetalGear,10 would enable up to 50 military servicemen to control up to 10 fictitious online identities each.

For mere mortals who lack a federal budget, there’s a company called Anonymizer, Inc. that offers a subscription-based non-attribution service. For about $80 a year, customers can establish an encrypted VPN session with a proxy server. This proxy then assigns the user an “untraceable” public IP address.11 The company claims that logs are not archived or even monitored. The Tor network (see Figure 9-1) is a massive collection of geo-distributed computers, or nodes. The scheme used by Tor to ensure anonymity is similar to the botnet approach. A computer running the Tor client software establishes an encrypted session with an entry node in the Tor network, and the encrypted data sent from the client is bounced around through a bunch of intermediary nodes, at random, until the corresponding network traffic hits an exit node and is sent off to the originally intended destination. Tor is effective enough at what it does that law enforcement is often at a loss to identify attackers that use the service. For instance, the National Police Agency in Japan found the process of tracking down cyber criminals so work-intensive that in April of 2013 they asked ISPs across the country to block Tor traffic altogether.12 To help protect your anonymity, Strongbox is only accessible using the Tor network (https://www.torproject.org). When using Strongbox, The New Yorker will not record your I.P. address or information about your browser, computer, or operating system, nor will we embed third-party content or deliver cookies to your browser. StrongBox is at best only moderately secure due to its use of insecure-by-design Tor and .onion. At worst it is highly insecure due to excessive and misleading promotion of Tor and .onion, both easily spied upon services by officials, their contractors and individuals who have the same hacking and cracking skills … For example, it’s possible for Tor nodes to become subverted by malware (or unscrupulous node operators) and subsequently be used to determine who’s talking to whom. It’s been shown that if someone using Tor also happens to be using an inherently insecure peer-to-peer file sharing application (e.g. BitTorrent) they face the risk of exposing their position.16 Then there’s the fact that older versions of Tor server software (i.e. prior to version 2.4) use weak encryption that many people believe the NSA can easily crack using arrays of custom-built hardware.

Security researcher Rob Graham describes the results of an experiment involving over 22,000 Tor connections: In what’s known as a traffic confirmation attack (also known as end-to-end correlation), an opponent watching both the network traffic going into a circuit of Tor nodes and the traffic exiting the circuit can wield statistical tools to identify a specific communication path. This attack works primarily because Tor is a low-latency service which aims to get network traffic to its destination with minimal delay. Given that roughly 90 percent of the world’s Internet communication flows through the United States,18 there are those who argue that an organization like the NSA could wield this technique successfully.19 Staining documents with watermarks, or other less flagrant identifiers, is an age-old technique used by intelligence services to track down moles. In an attack which leverages this concept, the NSA has been known to stain network traffic by purchasing ad space from online companies like Google.20 The NSA advertisements incite a user’s web browser to create a cookie which identifies the user viewing the ad. The NSA uses this cookie as a stain of sorts so that they can spot a particular user even if their IP address changes. It’s also possible for client machines using Tor to be purposefully infected by drive-by malware so that they can be identified. In early August of 2013 a report appeared in Wired magazine about one such incident. Researchers discovered malware that leveraged a software flaw in Mozilla’s Firefox web browser to identify users trying to disguise their location via anonymity services like Tor.21 It turned out that the FBI was behind the subversion campaign.22 which have been placed at strategic points on the high-speed cables that make up the Internet’s backbone. This placement is crucial, and depends heavily on cooperation with major Telecom providers. QUANTUM servers have to be is a position where they can respond more quickly than the legitimate web sites, so that the QUANTUM servers can beat them to the punch line, so to speak. It’s sort of a High-Frequency Trading effect, where servers gain an inside edge because their privileged geographic placement offers faster access. Once QUANTUM servers have acquired the undivided attention of the Tor user’s web browser, they execute a packet injection attack that directs the Tor user to a second set of servers, codenamed FOXACID. FOXACID servers are exploit orchestrators that can use a variety of specially-tailored attacks to infect a visiting computer.

Once infected, a compromised machine establishes a covert communication channel, known as a callback, with FOX-ACID servers to funnel user data to the NSA and install additional malware if needed to ensure long-term infestation. In essence, FOXACID servers are command and control machines. To get an idea of the scale of this program, in 2008 the volume of callback traffic became so great that the NSA had to develop a dedicated system just to handle it. In retrospect it would appear that the NSA is building its own botnets and is following the basic operational strategies and multi-tiered architectural schemes presented in Chapter Four. Weaknesses aside, the Tor project was originally funded by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,24 and it still receives a significant amount of money from the government.25 The Tor project’s 2012 financial report states the Department of Defense (via SRI) provided $876, 099 in funds.26 This is roughly 40 percent of the project’s $2 million budget. for bi-directional communications over the Internet where the source and destination cannot be determined by a midpoint?” The ^(*)PURPOSE^(*) was for DoD/Intelligence usage (open source intelligence gathering, covering of forward deployed assets, whatever). Not helping dissidents in repressive countries. Not assisting criminals in covering their electronic tracks. Not helping bit-torrent users avoid MPAA/RIAA prosecution. Not giving a 10 year old a way to bypass an anti-porn filter. Of course, we knew those would be other unavoidable uses for the technology, but that was immaterial to the problem at hand we were trying to solve (and if those uses were going to give us more cover traffic to better hide what we wanted to use the network for, all the better … I once told a flag officer that much to his chagrin). I should know, I was the recipient of that question from David, and Paul was brought into the mix a few days later after I had sketched out a basic (flawed) design for the original Onion Routing. Mr. Reed’s candid e-mail raises issues. There’s a sort of cognitive dissonance at play. Officials publicly announce that they want “to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment – who did it, from where, why and what was the result – more manageable.”28 In other words, they want to drive anonymity out of the Internet. Yet, oddly, at the same time the Department of Defense forged ahead to investigate technology that helped create the Tor project. Such is the apparent double standard.

In a world of stark transparency the invisible man is king. The U.S. government is completely trustworthy a priori, and so it’s assumed that it should be the sole beneficiary of truly high-security technology. Everyone else, outside of the government’s circle of trust, must surrender their privacy and make do with intentionally hobbled software. As far as espionage is concerned the absence of attribution appears to be the rule rather than the exception. In fact, there have been instances in the past where when investigators thought that a nation-state was involved and strongly believed that they knew who was responsible, and were completely wrong. A DDoS attack noted earlier in Chapter Seven is an example: early in July of 2009, the Wall Street Journal published an article about DDoS attacks that simultaneously hit government networks belonging to the United States and South Korea.29 The article intimated that North Korea might be responsible, given that the attacks began following the United Nations decision to impose new sanctions on the country. Global Digital Broadcast Limited were aware of the circumstance in the middle of Monday night and due to the nature and potential location it was coming from, have treated it with utmost severity. Our engineers quickly discounted it as coming from a North Korean Government site, as suggested and was tracked back to the source which was on a VPN circuit in Miami.31 For all of the bombast about North Korea, the attacks were tracked back to an ambiguous dead end in Miami, which could have been anyone or perhaps another relay in a longer circuit. Can you imagine how our leaders would look if they had followed Hoekstra’s suggestion? This episode should be a lesson to anyone who feels the urge to entertain the sabre rattling of politicians in the wake of a cyber-attack. History repeated itself years later in March of 2013, when two South Korean broadcasters and three South Korean banks suffered cyber-attacks that affected some 32,000 computers. The attackers, a group calling itself the “Whois Team,” executed their attack using relatively unsophisticated commodity malware which wipes the hard drive of the computers it compromises.32 Investigators initially traced the attacks to what they believed was the IP address of a server in China,33 and commentators were quick to direct blame towards North Korea which had been making threats in response to a new round of economic sanctions by the United Nations.34 Shortly afterwards,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:113:0e5a829b0aea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3241, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 114, "text": "that affected some 32,000 computers.

Investigators also noted that of the 76 malicious software applications used in the attack, 30 were used in previous attacks where North Korea was suspect. Based on what we’ve seen so far, in addition to the material presented in the following section, these artifacts hardly assign culpability. Though the South Korean Internet and Security Agency (KISA) thinks that they do. The techniques surveyed in this chapter, which conceal the origin of network traffic, are just one subset of tools in a much larger black bag of tools. There are countless types of evidence that can be rigged, overwritten, manufactured, and distorted. In fact, over the years an entire discipline has evolved that’s dedicated to turning the whole process of computer investigation on its ear: we are referring to anti-forensics.38 Restating the original definition, anti-forensics seeks to defeat the process of forensic investigation by minimizing the number of forensic artifacts (data source elimination and data destruction). The artifacts that do remain will be tough to identify (data concealment) and difficult to interpret (data transformation). To add insult to injury, an attacker can leave behind misinformation that lures the incidence response to incorrect conclusions (data fabrication). In 1992 an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times about “nearly perfect” counterfeit U.S. $100 bills that had found their way into circulation.40 A congressional report placed the blame on Iran. The Secret Service, on the other hand, declined to comment on this report or its allegations. Nevertheless, there’s a relevant point here: if it’s possible to create “nearly perfect” forgeries of American currency, then creating forged cyber-attacks is also completely plausible. People who develop anti-forensic tools can testify that the technology has attained a level of sophistication where an attacker can tell whatever story they want … and it will entirely convince more credulous members of the public.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:114:f39e035e8bcb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3242, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "on Iran.

People who develop anti-forensic tools can testify that the technology has attained a level of sophistication where an attacker can tell whatever story they want … and it will entirely convince more credulous members of the public. Anti-forensics enables false-flag operations, a stratagem as old as espionage and a time-honored approach for justifying wars. From the standpoint of an offensive operation, it’s usually in an attacker’s best interests to muddy the water as much as possible. Should people expect anything less from national intelligence services or organized criminal enterprises? It’s only logical that an operator running a spy shop, as a matter of standard procedure, would go to great lengths to obfuscate any trail and stage operations in such a way as to implicate a third-party. Using internationalized tools, a different language, foreign computing algorithms, planted artifacts, and pivot points in other countries are all par for the course. Any spies worth their salt will use these techniques. TAO increasingly depends on clandestine techniques, such as commercial cover, to hide its activities. TAO uses an array of commercial business entities, some of them proprietary companies established specifically for this purpose, to try to hide its global computer-hacking activities from computer security experts in a maze of interlocking computer servers and command-and-control systems located in the United States and overseas that have no discernible link to the NSA or the U.S. government. 41 It’s meaningless because governments and private sector outfits in several nations have developed, and invested heavily in, anti-forensic technology which ensures that this is the case. The bottom line: there are high-level actors stealing secrets, and foiling attribution is a necessary prerequisite. Welcome, dear reader, to the wilderness of mirrors. Ultimately, most forensic artifacts are primarily just a sequence of bytes. These bytes can be manipulated by an attacker to create the desired perception of culpability. To compound matters, everyone has good reasons to fabricate evidence. A post at the website Cryptome describes a few such reasons43: Security experts plant malware, genuine and spoofed, as poison pills or APTs to trace, combat and counterattack attackers, to deceive and scare downloaders and to muddle publicity about attacks. Competitors plant malware to disparage products and services. AV firms plant malware to boost the market. Governments plant malware to increase fear, doubt and dependency on national security. Hackers plant malware for lulz and braggardy. Malware – and reports of malware – can be an attention-getting hoax as with any form of fear-driven security.

Given the ease with which a funded operation could stage a cyber-attack and make it appear to emanate from a particular foreign country, it’s risky to put one’s faith in the clues that attackers leave behind. In fact, you should be particularly suspicious of government officials like Peter Hoekstra who fail to question the veracity of digital forensic artifacts and then hastily overreact. n the quest for better security, former DNI Mike McConnell ad-I vises us to look back to the Cold War, where the United States used to threat of massive retaliation to keep enemies in check. He’s not alone, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has said that countries should have the capability to respond “with overwhelming force” to cyber-attacks.44 This mindset has been spelled out formally in official documents. For example, The Defense Science Board (DSB)’s Task Force on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat is the product of an 18-month study and outlines what it refers to as an “overall risk reduction strategy.”45 That strategy projects a future of cyber warfare in which the U.S. will deter attacks in part by ensuring a nuclear strike capability in the face of “existential cyber attack” and developing “world class cyber offensive capabilities” and an expanded legion of “cyber warriors.” What this entails is investing heavily in cyber arms and, as a direct consequence, providing a healthy infusion of tax dollars to the defense industry. The problem with leveraging a stockpile of pricey cyber weapons to discourage attackers is that the government needs to know where to aim them once attacked. If you can’t determine who’s behind an attack, how do you retaliate? Martin Libicki, a senior researcher at Rand, warns: During the Cold War, it was easy to pinpoint where intercontinental ballistic missiles were launched from. As we have clearly shown, the same dynamic doesn’t hold on the Internet. Operational anonymity is well within the reach of a funded group, whether the attackers are part of a campaign run by an intelligence agency, sponsored by rogue corporate interests, or bankrolled by criminal organizations. To be effective, deterrence depends on attribution. But attribution is a scarce commodity at best. Back in 1972, when Richard Nixon was President, the United States joined in an international treaty with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to ban research on and the production of bioweapons. What the United States didn’t realize is that the Soviets interpreted the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention as a green light to aggressively race ahead with its own program that scaled up", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:116:f55df46677ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3244, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "organizations.

What the United States didn’t realize is that the Soviets interpreted the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention as a green light to aggressively race ahead with its own program that scaled up into hundreds of tons. Perhaps the Soviets thought that they could gain a strategic advantage while everyone else was dismantling their own programs? According to Kanatjan Alibekov, the First Deputy Director of Biopreparat (the Soviet’s biological weapons program): The same dynamic doesn’t apply to cyber weapons. Software engineers don’t need fermenting vats that are a story and a half high. Cyber weapons tend to be small and easy to conceal. Engineers can develop cyber weapons anywhere, with little or no footprint, using tightly compartmentalized cells of developers hidden away in unremarkable office spaces. All that’s needed is computers, development tools, and access to the Internet (none of which will raise any eyebrows). In the end, all of the documentation and finished binaries can be zipped up and archived in an encrypted file that takes up a less than 100 megabytes. Try hunting that down with a spy satellite! Even if a country signed a treaty that bound them not to develop certain types of cyber weapons, there would be no way to verify such an agreement. Once more, if a country actually breaks its promise and deploys offensive cyber ordnance, it will no doubt also utilize anonymity technology in conjunction with anti-forensics to throw off investigators. In other words, the notion that we could use arms control to limit the development of cyber weaponry is probably not practical. 15) Barton Gellman, Craig Timberg, and Steven Rich, “Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network,” Washington Post, October 4, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6- 2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_print.html. 16) One Bad Apple Spoils the Bunch, Stevens Le Blond Pere Manils Abdelberi Chaabane Mohamed Ali Kaafar Claude Castelluccia Arnaud Legout Walid Dabbous, LEET 2011, 4^(th) USENIX Workshop on Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent Threats, March 29, 2011, http://static.usenix.org/event/leet11/tech/slides/leblond.pdf. Despite the prevalence of anti-forensic technology, there are still those who believe that they can solve the quanreminiscent of China’s old Hukou and Liangpiao systems. In other words, they believe that if they simply capture, archive, track, and analyze enough data they can achieve the Holy Grail of determining precisely who did what, and to whom, out on the Internet.

Back in 2006, a report published by the Washington Post put the number of people being watched without court authority at around 5,000. According to this same article, less than 10 of these people succeeded in rousing enough suspicion to justify the interception of their communications.7 The sheer demand for monitoring technology is reflected by the fact that between 2001 and 2011 the number of instances where the Department of Justice used warrantless surveillance methods increased six-fold: from 5,683 to 37,616.9 AT&T likewise reports that in 2011 it received in excess of 700 monitoring requests every day from various law enforcement agents, of which approximately 230 sidestepped the normal warrant process. This is triple the number of daily requests fielded by AT&T in 2007.10 Contrary to the claims of law enforcement officials that they’re “going dark,” with regard to their inability to monitor the public as technology progresses,12 the tools available to our security services allow them to do things that they could only have dreamed of back in the 1980s. Then there’s also the fact that, in this day and age, most people voluntarily carry a tracking device (i.e. a smart phone) which can be used to pinpoint their geographic locations, past movements, as well as harvesting a wealth of meta-data.13 The end result is that people’s daily interactions generate a rich trail of digital evidence that investigators can use to map out social relationships and create individual dossiers in ways that were unthinkable in J. Edgar Hoover’s era. As Cryptome has claimed for years, the Internet is a massive tool for surveillance.14 There are sprawling databases of information being maintained about us, and intelligence officers are just itching to find new ways to leverage them. High-ranking officials have been less than forthcoming about all of this. If anything, they’ve tried to downplay it, lie about it, or simply keep it under wraps. The program of warrantless wiretapping that took place during the tenure of George W. Bush, known inside the NSA by the code name Stellar Wind, was secretly authorized by the executive branch in 2002. It allowed the NSA to tap into the fiber optic cables which connect the United States to other countries using special fiber optic signal splitters.15 In 2005, based on information provided by a whistleblower in the Department of Justice named Thomas Tamm,16 the New York Times broke the story about the Stellar Wind17 and public outcry was strong enough that the program was presumably halted in early", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:118:097ce0a7f24b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3246, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "code name Stellar Wind, was secretly authorized by the executive branch in 2002.

The case succeeded because the plaintiffs were able to prove they were the subject of surveillance. The government, it turns out, enabled this lawsuit by accidentally released a classified document proving that the plaintiffs were being monitored.20 The end of the Terrorist Surveillance Program was not the end of warrantless wiretapping. Lawmakers responded to the suspension of the program by spearheading amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978. This was a shot across the bow as far as civil liberties are concerned. To see why, let’s rewind to the Nixon era. The FISA of 1978 is a law that was enacted specifically to outlaw warrantless wiretaps. It was a direct result of the Church Committee investigations of the 1970s, a series of congressional hearings and reports that were conducted to probe abuse of authority by U.S. security services (the FBI, CIA, and NSA) in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Lawmakers were eager to loosen restrictions established by FISA. The resulting Protect America Act of 2007 in effect moved the goal posts to legalize aspects of the warrantless wiretapping program that were originally prohibited, in addition to providing complete legal immunity to telecom carriers that had cooperated with the government. When the Protect America Act of 2007 hit its built-in expiration date, the subsequent FISA Amendments Act of 2008 was enacted to instantiate many of the provisions of the 2007 act.21 Specifically, section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 allows the government to monitor communications (email, text messages, phone calls) to acquire “foreign intelligence” on a non-citizen without a probable-cause warrant if that non-citizen is “reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.” David Kris, a former attorney for the Department of Justice claims that the government has construed the law in a manner where purely domestic communication can also be captured and analyzed as long as the parties involved are believed to be members of al-Qaeda.22 But even then there are caveats that increase your chances of being watched. For instance, the Washington Post reported that analysts", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:119:8e422b706068", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3247, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "probable-cause warrant if that non-citizen is “reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.” David Kris, a former attorney for the Department of Justice claims that the government has construed the law in a manner where purely domestic communication can also be captured and analyzed as long as the parties involved are believed to be members of al-Qaeda.22 But even then there are caveats that increase your chances of being watched. For instance, the Washington Post reported that analysts only needed to be 51 percent sure that a target was foreign in order to collect information.23 According to government documents that were leaked by the Guardian, it turns out: In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person … a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively identified as a United States person.24 geted outside of the U.S. According to a report published by the New York Times in August of 2013, an unnamed senior intelligence official claimed that the NSA is also searching all of the e-mail and other textbased digital communications that cross the U.S. border for anyone who merely references information about a foreign target of interest (e.g. a name, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number, etc.).25 In other words, because the NSA does some sort of initial content searches of the bulk communications that they collect, perhaps using very fast computers, then only keep some unknown subset of that greater bulk for a later date, no “bulk collection” occurs. This is ridiculous. No matter how you slice it, the NSA is mass collecting and searching millions of American communications without a warrant.27 This is exactly how the NSA skirts FISA restrictions, by monitoring data from access points outside of U.S. territory. Through secret arrangements with allied intelligence services and foreign telecom providers, the NSA collects contact lists associated with e-mail and instant messaging clients at a rate of over 250 million per year. The assumption is that people using such communication channels aren’t U.S. citizens, though there’s no guarantee by any means. The Washington Post reports: In practice, data from Americans is collected in large volumes – in part because they live and work overseas, but also because data crosses international boundaries even when its American owners stay at home. Large technology companies, including Google and Facebook, maintain data centers around the world to balance loads on their servers and work around outages.30 Legal provisions don’t seem to provide much protection against domestic surveillance in practice. In April of 2009, well after the passage of the FISA Amendments Act in 2008, U.S. intelligence officials admitted that the NSA engaged in “significant and system” “overcollection” of domestic communication.31 A couple of months later, in June of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:120:90ba4b3b52c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3248, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "American owners stay at home.

In the 12 months leading up to May 2012 alone, auditors found 2,776 incidents where monitoring rules were broken.33 And these were just the violations that occurred at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade. The NSA has regional outposts worldwide. Furthermore, in October of 2011 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the federal court created by the FISA to issue surveillance warrants, issued an 86-page opinion which concluded that NSA collection guidelines were unconstitutional.34 For over a year this opinion remained secret at the urging of the Department of Justice.35 It was finally released in August of 2013, offering conclusive evidence that the NSA indeed had links into backbone networks across the country. According to a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation: In March of 2012 the Director of NSA, General Keith Alexander, stood up in front of the House Armed Services subcommittee and explicitly denied that the NSA was intercepting American citizens’ communications.37 The following transcript records an exchange between Congressman Hank Johnson and General Alexander. Of course, there was a subtle form of deception at work. General Alexander was using the word intercept in a particular way. In NSA parlance, data is only intercepted after it has been specially processed for human perusal. By all means, data can still be collected without being inspected.38 So if congressional representatives had re-phrased their questions (e.g. “are you storing e-mails”), his answers would have been different. Narus is subsidiary of defense contractor Boeing, and is an ISS World Conference regular. It sells products geared towards managing and analyzing network traffic. According to a former technician at AT&T, Mark Klein, Narus developed equipment used by AT&T to capture and re-route network traffic in San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego.41 This data ends up in out-of-theway places like Bluffdale, Utah, where the NSA is building a massive complex to remotely store and analyze harvested information.42 In a secret arrangement that was established in the absence of legislative approval, U.S. attorney general Eric Holder granted the National Counterterrorism Center", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:121:a5c886cede4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3249, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "According to a former technician at AT&T, Mark Klein, Narus developed equipment used by AT&T to capture and re-route network traffic in San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego.41 This data ends up in out-of-theway places like Bluffdale, Utah, where the NSA is building a massive complex to remotely store and analyze harvested information.42 In a secret arrangement that was established in the absence of legislative approval, U.S. attorney general Eric Holder granted the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) the authority to collect and store files on American citizens, from any government database, regardless of whether they’re actually suspected of committing a crime.43 The first document to come to light was a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) order.45 FISC is a secret U.S. Federal court set up by the 1978 FISA to issue secret surveillance warrants. This secrecy, by the way, makes it hard to judge the effectiveness of the court as a tool of oversight. The aforementioned FISC order disclosed by Snowden compelled telecom provider Verizon to hand over metadata on all of the calls routed through its systems for a period of three months, regardless of whether the customers were within the U.S. or making a call between the U.S. and another country. In other words, the court order mandated dragnet surveillance of a telecom provider. Everything but the raw content of the calls themselves was handed over. The Verizon order is allowed by the “business records” provision in the Patriot Act (i.e. U.S. Code, Title 50, Chapter 36, Subchapter IV, section 1861). As a matter of pedagogy, the aforementioned legal provision (section 1861) was inserted into U.S. legal code by Section 215 of the Patriot Act (i.e. the section entitled Access to Records and Other Items under The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). So, many writers simply refer to Section 215 of the Patriot Act when referring to record collection provisions. There are those who would argue that Section 215, as it’s being employed by the NSA, violates the letter and the spirit of the law. Christopher Sprigman, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society argue: Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican and one of the architects of the Patriot Act, and a man not known as a civil libertarian, has said that “Congress intended to allow the intelligence communities to access targeted information for specific investigations” The N.S.A.’s demand for information about every American’s phone calls isn’t “targeted” at all – it’s a dragnet. “How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?” Mr. Sensenbrenner has asked.

The answer is simple: It’s not.48 NSA has been doing all this stuff all along, and it’s been all the companies, not just one. And I basically looked at that and said, well, if Verizon got one, so did everybody else, which means that, you know, they’re just continuing the collection of this kind of information on all U.S. citizens.49 Management Directive 424, NSA analysts were secretly granted the authority to track the communication metadata (phone logs, e-mail, etc.) of anyone if they could justify the monitoring in terms of foreign intelligence.50 This sort of monitoring doesn’t require a warrant and is used to create a contact chain that maps out the target’s social connections. The NSA has vast repositories to store this information. For example the Marina database which can store an entire year’s worth of computer-based metadata (e.g. web browsing history, e-mail activity, search engine queries).51 Telephone-based metadata is stored in other classified NSA repositories. Shortly after the Verizon court order became public knowledge, additional disclosures followed. The Guardian released four slides from a top-secret 41-slide PowerPoint presentation that described a data collection program called PRISM.53 It’s also known as US-984XN, which is the program’s Signals Intelligence Activity Designator (SIGAD). The program involves remotely collecting both stored data and real-time data from online service providers located inside the United States to acquire emails, chats, search queries, photos, videos, VoIP data, stored files, etc. The PRISM program doesn’t rely on individual warrants to collect data. Instead, the entire initiative collectively is authorized once a year by the FISC.54 It appears that one of the goals of the PRISM program was to establish a technical solution to expedite the process of providing secretly requested data so that complying companies could both automate the process of responding to secret requests and transfer data in a more standard format.55 To help participating companies cover the cost of compliance, the NSA has paid out millions of dollars.56 As you might expect, in light of FISA secrecy restrictions, when queried about this program corporate executives denied any knowledge of PRISM.57 In addition, in its initial coverage of the story, the Guardian quoted an unnamed senior White House official who asserted that PRISM was entirely legal and followed the restrictions specified in Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act: The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:123:b50146dba305", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3251, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 124, "text": "its initial coverage of the story, the Guardian quoted an unnamed senior White House official who asserted that PRISM was entirely legal and followed the restrictions specified in Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act: The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.58 What I can say unequivocally is that if you are a U.S. person, the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls, and the NSA cannot target your emails … and – unless they – and usually it wouldn’t be “they,” it would be the FBI – go to a court and obtain a warrant and seek probable cause, the same way it’s always been, the same way, when we were growing up and were watching movies, you know, you want to go set up a wiretap, you’ve got to go to a judge, show probable cause. Of course, based on the earlier discussion of Section 702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, his appraisal is incorrect. If an American citizen is communicating with a target outside of the United States who’s not a U.S. citizen, then the communication can be captured without a warrant. And even then there’s really no clear-cut way to ensure that U.S. citizens are not being caught in the surveillance dragnet. The agency has been playing all sorts of games with names, dividing their efforts up and using many different code names in an attempt to disguise what they’re doing. It allows them to deny that a specific program is doing something, while conveniently omitting the fact that another program is doing the thing and the two programs are talking to each other.59 While the NSA goes directly to companies, under court-approval, to procure data under PRISM, that doesn’t mean that it’s the only program for corporate collection or that the NSA even needs court approval to collect the network traffic of Americans. Under project MUSCU-LAR, the NSA, with the involvement of the UK’s GCHQ are tapping fiber-optic links used specifically by Google and Yahoo! datacenters. The subverted network gateways lie outside of the United States. This fact allows the NSA to conduct bulk collection without running into FISA restrictions, as the NSA is free to assume that anyone using a foreign network is a foreigner. This shows just how fragile FISA rules are, and how nimble the NSA is in bypassing alleged legal limits. According to a top-secret accounting dated Jan. 9, 2013, the NSA’s acquisitions directorate sends millions of records every day from internal Yahoo! and Google networks to data warehouses at the agency’s headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.

In the preceding 30 days, the report said, field collectors had processed and sent back 181,280,466 new records – including “metadata,” which would indicate who sent or received e-mails and when, as well as content such as text, audio and video.60 Keep in mind that a company like Google can afford to spend lots of money on high-grade security. Yet the spooks at the NSA casually walk right through whatever defenses Google can muster. Did Google simply turn a blind eye in exchange for plausible deniability? Did the NSA have cooperation from a third party? Or may be they just cracked the SSL encryption outright? As the “Clipper Chip” fiasco in the early 1990s demonstrated, this fear was not unfounded. The government, concerned that emerging encryption technology would hamper intelligence collection, tried to force the private sector to use a special “watered down” encryption hardware platform (Clipper Chip) which provided a built-in back door, by design, for the government. Ultimately cyber-activists foiled the Clipper Chip initiative by globally disseminating high-grade encryption tools. While the Clipper Chip battle was lost, the larger war quietly raged onward. While strong encryption technology is arguably available to anyone who knows where to look,61 the security services have responded with a couple of novel counter-maneuvers. As we saw in Chapter Six, the intelligence services went around convincing the big name vendors to insert back doors and intentional flaws into their products. Government spies also worked to weaken cryptographic standards, and (when all else failed) they acquired private encryption keys directly. But that’s not all. The government also decided to leverage the appeal of social media. Rather than sneaking onto people’s computers and decrypting their data, data collectors are relying on the fact that in the age of social media, people willfully volunteer their personal information online. The trick eliciting participation is to add a measure of convenience. Security expert Bruce Schneier astutely observes: If the government demanded that we all carry tracking devices 24/7 , we would rebel. Yet we all carry cell phones. If the government demanded that we deposit copies of all of our messages to each other with the police, we’d declare their actions unconstitutional. Yet we all use Gmail and Facebook messaging and SMS. If the government demanded that we give them access to all the photographs we take, and that we identify all of the people in them and tag them with locations, we’d refuse.

Yet we do exactly that on Flickr and other sites …62 The CIA has a team referred to as the vengeful librarians that does just that. This open source intelligence effort relies heavily on data collected from Internet-based social media.63 For example, they followed Twitter after Osama bin Laden was assassinated in order to assess the public’s response worldwide. The vengeful librarians also compare the conclusions of their social media analyses with those of polling companies to determine which mechanism produces more accurate results. We can’t help but wonder if the results obtained by the CIA’s vengeful librarians have ever experienced signal interference, so to speak, from competing programs over in the Pentagon (e.g. something like Operation Earnest Voice) that are intended to disseminate propaganda via social media? After all, it would be difficult to acquire a clear snapshot of reality when the waters have already been muddied by a military psyop. As usual, the private sector sees a need it can fill and is looking for a piece of the action. Both the CIA (via its In-Q-Tel venture arm) and Google have invested in a company named Recorded Future which scours the web for data in real-time, to establish relationships between people and events, and then uses this data to make predictions about the future.64 Likewise, Raytheon has developed a proof-of-concept tool called Riot, which stands for Rapid Information Overlay Technology. Riot uses “extreme-scale analytics” to harvest social media sites like Facebook and Twitter and distill a profile of people’s entire lives: their acquaintances, where they’ve traveled to, details about their daily routines, with the implied potential of being able to extrapolate future behavior.65 Then there are companies that don’t limit themselves to just social media. Relationship Science is a company that eschews user-generated content in favor of processing raw online data en mass to map out personal relationships. For $3, 000 a year, customers can access the company’s site and find out exactly who’s acquainted with whom, and with what degree of familiarity.66 It’s a “Six Degrees of Separation” sort of tool. Ostensibly, this could be used by an entrepreneur who’d like to pitch his idea to a venture capitalist whom he doesn’t personally know.

The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS), National Operations Center (NOC), will launch and lead the Publicly Available Social Media Monitoring and Situational Awareness (Initiative) to assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components involved in fulfilling OPS statutory responsibility (Section 515 of the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. § 321d(b)(1)) to provide situational awareness and establish a common operating picture for the federal government, and for those state, local, and tribal governments, as appropriate.67 So what exactly are they looking for? The Electronic Privacy and Information Center (EPIC) filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in search of details about this program back in April of 2011. In December of 2011 EPIC filed a lawsuit against the DHS to compel disclosure of documents. In the following month, as 2012 rolled in, the DHS started to cough up documents (i.e. 285 pages). What EPIC discovered was that the DHS hired General Dynamic to watch for: he government collects veritable mountains of information Tabout us. Every time you renew a license, pay your taxes, go to court, purchase property, or get pulled over by a police officer, there are entries created in a database somewhere. There are, however, some types of information that the government can’t directly accumulate. This is what’s driving the idea of information sharing between the government and corporate America. A number of big names in the social network market have proactively published what they call compliance handbooks directed specifically towards government officials. These manuals describe what sort of data is archived, how it can be requested, and the services available to access it. Some providers even provide access in real-time for emergency situations related to National Security. A number of these compliance handbooks have been acquired by leak website Cryptome. You can view them at: http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/aol-spy3.pdf http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/facebook-spy3.pdf http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/gmail-spy2.pdf http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/myspace-spy3.pdf http://cryptome.org//isp-spy/microsoft-spy.zip http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/twitter-spy.pdf http://cryptome.org/isp-spy/yahoo-preserve.pdf As you can see, the major players in social media, like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace have published guides. Some organizations have gone a step further and have created dedicated interfaces so that security services can access allegedly secure communications. According to a report published by Moscow News, this is exactly the path taken by Microsoft: Since its acquisition of Skype in May 2011, Microsoft has added a legitimate monitoring technology to Skype, says Maksim Emm, Executive Director of Peak Systems.

For example, back in early 2005 technicians at Vodafone Greece, a major cellular service provider, discovered that intruders had commandeered lawful interception functionality on a series of telephone switches to eavesdrop on over 100 high-level officials for the better part of a year. The list of people who were monitored included the prime minister of Greece, the mayor of Athens, and an employee of the U.S. embassy.74 In the event that an organization shows any sign of resistance, the government can legally demand information. Using what’s known as a “National Security Letter” (NSL), intelligence agencies (e.g. the CIA, FBI, Department of Defense, etc.) can compel organizations to submit information on specific individuals (e-mail and telephone logs, financial records, and credit information) without offering probable cause. Furthermore, the NSL legislation contains provisions for a gag order that prevents recipients from disclosing that they’ve received an NSL. One exception is Nicholas Merrill, the owner a New York ISP named Calyx Internet Access. In February of 2004 he received an NSL from the FBI and responded by mounting a legal challenge against it. For years, as the trial dragged on, Merrill was known in official courts documents only as “John Doe.” The FBI would eventually drop its demand for records and in July of 2010 the courts released Merrill from the gag order that prevented him from even discussing the case. Looking back over his court battle, Merrill commented: I kind of felt at the beginning, so few people challenge this thing, I couldn’t just stand by and see, in my opinion, the basic underpinnings of our government undermined … I was taught about how sophisticated our system of checks and balances is … and if you really believe in that, then the idea of one branch of government just demanding records without being checked and balanced by the judicial just is so obviously wrong on the surface.77 Shortly after the Google disclosure, Microsoft came forward and released figures that hinted at the number of NSLs the company has received. For example, in both 2010 and 2011 Microsoft received between 1,000 and 1,999 NSLs. So we know with certainty that the companies received at least a thousand NSLs.79 Secrecy is the name of the game. Secret government surveillance is difficult to hold to account.

Unless we as Americans insist that the government release basic information about what its surveillance powers authorize and how it is using those powers, there is little reason to believe that the surveillance abuses of the past will not be repeated.80 Such is the significance of the NSL’s gag order. In lawsuits that questioned the legality of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (e.g. Clapper vs. Amnesty International), the cases were frequently dismissed because the plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate that they were under surveillance. Gag orders ensure that this state of affairs persists. It’s only in rare circumstances, like Al-Haramain vs. Obama, where the government accidentally releases classified information and tips its hat to those being monitored. The secretive nature of NSLs may be their undoing. In March of 2013 a federal judge in Northern California, in response to a legal challenge filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation on behalf of an unnamed telecom, took this issue head on. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that NSLs were unconstitutional and barred the government from issuing them.81 Judge Illston stayed her order for 90 days in the event that the government wanted the opportunity to appeal her decision. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA, aka H.R. 624) is a bill that was written by Congressman Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan who chairs the House Select Committee on Intelligence, and Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat from Maryland who also sits on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Proponents claim that the bill is aimed at allowing the government and the private sector to expediently share threat information in an effort to ward off cyber-attacks. ‘(i) use cybersecurity systems to identify and obtain cyber threat information to protect the rights and property of such self-protected entity; and ‘(ii) share such cyber threat information with any other entity, including the entities of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice designated under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2(b) of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. In other words, the above CISPA excerpt provides broad legal immunity to companies that decide to cooperate with warrantless seizure of information, and furthermore exempts them from disclosure rules. CISPA will allow the security apparatus of the U.S. government to hoover up data behind the scenes as long as the private sector actors consent, leaving the general public largely oblivious to when they’re being watched. History has shown that companies like AT&T have readily acquiesced when asked to break existing federal wiretap laws. Then there’s the vague wording of using “cybersecurity systems” to acquire “cyber threat information” for the sake of “cybersecurity.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:129:78a516a5aade", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3257, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "and furthermore exempts them from disclosure rules.

Then there’s the vague wording of using “cybersecurity systems” to acquire “cyber threat information” for the sake of “cybersecurity.” This could potentially give companies new rights to monitor users as long as they could find a way to justify the monitoring in terms of a perceived threat to their networks or systems. For example, AT&T maintains a massive phone call database that goes all the way back to 1987, providing details on every single call that has ever passed through the company’s telephone switches. To give you an idea of the scale involved, approximately 4 billion calls are added to this database every day. Since 2007 AT&T has been providing metadata on phone calls to the DEA and local law enforcement drug units in a counter-narcotics program called the “Hemisphere Project.”82 Phone metadata is released in response to administrative subpoenas issued by the DEA and the individual requests are handled by AT&T technicians who’ve been embedded in local crime groups all over the country. Google exists in a market where it sells its product (user data) to buyers (the advertisers). The company’s hallmark web search engine technology, though impressive, is not how Google supports itself. The company’s truly valuable commodity, what it charges its customers for, is information on the people who use Google services. Business is booming. According to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, every day the company generates a couple of exabytes of data.85 To give you a frame of reference for this figure, the amount of data that mankind had created from its inception up until 2003 is on the order of five exabytes. Google doesn’t hesitate to capitalize on this tidal wave of data. For example, it’s a well-known fact that Google regularly scans Gmail messages for keywords. In July of 2010 during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the privacy engineering lead at Google, Dr. Alma Whitten, said: Companies have already begun aggressive lobbying campaigns to stop or dilute tighter privacy rules, which they say would interfere with their business models and decrease profits and growth. The companies’ efforts are, in turn, supported by countries like England and Ireland that fear that such restrictions would hamper economic recovery.87 To evade this kind of data collection you could eschew online services and social networks altogether. For the moment, it’s still a tenable alternative. Yet seemingly small decisions can morph into momentous decisions over time.

Information resellers thrive because they’ve developed cost-effective ways to aggregate information from a variety of sources, correlate it, repackage it, and then provide access to government agencies for a fee (see Figure 10-1). Credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union are well-known information resellers. LexisNexis, a company that opened up the field of electronically accessible legal documents in the 1970s, is another prominent data broker. The vast majority of the information that’s purchased on behalf of the government is used by U.S. security services (tracking fugitives, performing background checks, border screening, researching asset ownership, etc.).88 There is actually one instance of a telecom CEO going to Jail. That would be Joseph Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International. He was convicted on 19 counts of insider trading.90 Nacchio alleges that in February of 2001, six months before the attacks of 9/11, the NSA approached him about spying on customers and he flat out refused. Nacchio claims that the government then retaliated by canceling a number of unrelated contracts with Qwest and initiating a politically motivated criminal case against him.91 Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Facebook all made gestures of legal protest by petitioning the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to allow them to disclose more detailed statistics on government information requests.92 Once more, service providers voiced concern that collaborating with the government has damaged their credibility and could hurt their revenue as Internet users flocked en masse to other, less intrusive, platforms.93 On the other hand, most of these protests occurred after cookie cutter denials proved inadequate,94 after lies about cooperating with the NSA were exposed. Up until Ed Snowden’s disclosures, most corporate executives were acting as if nothing was wrong at all, publicly declaring that they didn’t know anything about special NSA programs to collect user data. The public record shows that corporate America has a history of cooperating with U.S. intelligence services. For instance, in the late 1940s the CIA launched a program called “Operation Mockingbird” in an effort to influence the corporate media.

For instance, in the late 1940s the CIA launched a program called “Operation Mockingbird” in an effort to influence the corporate media. The program took place under the supervision of Frank Wisner, the director of the CIA’s covert operation branch. Deborah Davis, a Village Voice reporter who investigated the CIA’s campaign in a 1979 book wrote: By the early 1950s, Wisner “owned” respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS and other communications vehicles. Wisner referred to this apparatus as a “Mighty Wurlitzer,” referencing the theater organ capable of controlling diverse pipes, instruments, and sound effects from a central console.96 The CIA maintained … a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence foreign opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of foreign newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets …97 The CIA’s influence wasn’t limited to foreign news sources. In 1977, one of the journalists who exposed the Watergate Scandal, Carl Bernstein, published a lengthy exposé which revealed that more than 400 American journalists were secretly carrying out assignments on behalf of the CIA. Bernstein noted: Documents published last year by WikiLeaks obtained from the U.S. intelligence contractor Stratfor, show that in 2011 Jared Cohen, then (as he is now) Director of Google Ideas, was off running secret missions to the edge of Iran in Azerbaijan. In these internal emails, Fred Burton, Stratfor’s Vice President for Intelligence and a former senior State Department official, describes Google as follows: Google is getting WH [White House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they are doing things the CIA cannot do…[Cohen] is going to get himself kidnapped or killed. Might be the best thing to happen to expose Google’s covert role in foaming up-risings, to be blunt. The U.S. Gov’t can then disavow knowledge and Google is left holding the shit-bag …100 In the Google book it even states that what Lockheed Martin was to the 20th century, hi-tech companies will be to the 21st. It’s a really quite strong form of neo-imperialism. And I don’t want to use that phrase as some sort of hackneyed Marxist expression, but that’s what it’s about – jacking in the entire world into the U.S. economic and informational system.103 What all of this demonstrates is that various components of the private and public sector are tightly interleaved on several different levels, such that with regard to data collection they may as well be a single entity.

Heidi Boghosian, the executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, states that it’s a matter of projecting elite power: For all intents and purposes, the distinction right now between government and the corporate world is virtually nil. They are hand-in-hand working to gather information about Americans as well as people across the globe, to really be in a race to collect more information than any other country can, because I think in their eyes, having this information, storing it, and being able to access it for years on end is a symbol of power and control. So that you can’t really make that distinction anymore between big business and government.104 While cooperation probably carried risks in the minds of corporate officers (especially if someone found out), the pluses ultimately outweighed the minuses. For example, as demonstrated in the previous section, a number of these companies (some of whom have gone to court in order to publicly disclose government surveillance requests)105 have been lobbying the government to weaken privacy laws. Remember, spying on consumers is often a fundamental part of the corporate business model. Government contracts also represent a significant stream of income for hi-tech vendors. For example, in May of 2012 the U.S. Department of the Interior awarded a 7-year $35 million dollar contract to Google to provide e-mail services.106 Also, in December of 2012 Microsoft signed a three-year $617 million enterprise license agreement with the Department of Defense.107 The more mature vendors, which have relationships with the federal government that span decades, tend to do very well. Over the course of 2012 IBM won approximately 1.5 billion dollars in contracts with the federal government.108 Think of it this way, someone has to sell the NSA the acres of supercomputers and networking equipment that it deploys to archive and decipher digital communications. The NSA’s new $1.2 billion datacenter in Bluffdale, Utah, is 15 times the size of the MetLife Stadium that hosts the New York Giants.110 It’s bigger than Google’s largest data center.111 Then there’s also the NSA’s $3.2 billion expansion into Site M, which represents an even larger deployment.112 Site M will host the U.S. Cyber Command Joint Operations Center (USCYBERCOM JOC). Its High Performance Computer Center (HPCC) is slated as being roughly three times as large as the one in Utah. Hi-tech vendors like Microsoft (sitting on a war chest of over 60 billion in cash reserves)114 or Apple (whose $147 billion cash hoard represents almost 10% of all corporate money not held by financial institutions115) aren’t exactly defenseless.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:133:aa0ba3b9e127", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3261, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "into Site M, which represents an even larger deployment.112 Site M will host the U.S. Cyber Command Joint Operations Center (USCYBERCOM JOC).

Hi-tech giants chose to acquiesce because the benefits outweighed the negative consequences. So there’s a convergence of interests at work. Both the government and corporate America are spying on the public. Both the government and corporate America are leveraging each other to get what they want. It’s almost unheard of to encounter a company like Lavabit that takes a firm ideological stance against government surveillance, to the extent that the owner of the company would rather shutter his service than continue to collaborate. You see, dear reader, for large service providers there’s too much money at stake. As we saw earlier, there’s a severe dissonance between what our leaders are saying and what whistleblowers like Thomas Tamm, William Binney, and Thomas Drake are saying. The basic narrative that officials have tried to convey is that PRISM and other programs like it are part of a lawful surveillance apparatus that, per the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, collects data on specific people rather than hoovering up everything. Whistleblower Ed Snowden claims, as do the other whistleblowers, that U.S. security services have fallen back on dragnet surveillance as the collection mechanism of choice. What makes Ed Snowden’s claims so damning is that he had possession of the classified documents to sufficiently corroborate his assertions. During an interview with journalist Glenn Greenwald he stated: The NSA specifically targets the communications of everyone. It ingests them by default. It collects them in its system, and it filters them, and it analyzes them, and it measures them, and it stores them for periods of time, simply because that’s the easiest, most efficient and most valuable way to achieve these ends. So while they may be intending to target someone associated with a foreign government or someone that they suspect of terrorism, they’re collecting your communications to do so. Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything. But I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal judge, to even the president, if I had a personal email.117 Once leaders start chipping away at civil liberties, it’s a slippery slope.

If people aren’t bothered by mass interception because they feel they haven’t done anything wrong, why not just give the authorities the ability to search anyone’s home or digital communication for no particular reason? You’ve got nothing to hide, right? After all, this might allow our security services to catch more terrorists. The disquieting fact is that the tools of an Orwellian society, the ability to capture, collect, and analyze every digital communication on the planet, have been put into place with nothing more than secretly interpreted policy directives to prevent abuse by those in power. To assume that this safeguards society is the height of recklessness. only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state are policy…. And because of that, a new leader will be elected, they’ll flip the switch, say that because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the world, you know, some new and unpredicted threat, we need more authority, we need more power, and there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it, and it’ll be turnkey tyranny.123 This long series of half-truths seriously damages the government’s credibility with regard to offering an honest public appraisal of its own surveillance programs. Why should anyone trust what officials have to say when their picture of reality contrasts so sharply against leaked government documents? Again, this is false. The Washington Post has reported on an internal NSA audit dated May of 2012 which noted 2,776 legal violations in the preceding 12 months.128 Furthermore it turns out that, according to the NSA’s inspector general, approximately a dozen violations over the past ten years were indeed willfully committed.129 Details on some of these incidents, where analysts abused their monitoring tools, have been released by the NSA and are a part of the public record.130 The Wall Street Journal has reported that the NSA’s surveillance apparatus can encompass up to 75% of all U.S. Internet traffic.132 Other estimates aren’t this optimistic. During a program segment on Democracy Now!, the owner of an e-mail provider named Lavabit came on the air to comment on why he shuttered his service. Lavabit gained public notoriety when it was disclosed that the company was the e-mail provider of choice for NSA whistleblower Ed Snowden.

In the wake of Snowden’s revelations, Lavabit closed its doors to protest legal coercion by U.S. security services. The owner, Ladar Levison, in the presence of his attorney, made the following statement: This sort of mass interception undermines constitutionally based freedoms and grants a dangerous amount of control to a small group of people. Imagine the power of an organization that can monitor, archive, and correlate everything that travels through global networks. This power is bolstered by a body of secret laws that has been established to justify the emerging surveillance state and is clearly antithetical to democracy. Secrecy poses the greatest threat to the United States because it divides the population into two groups, those with access to secret information and those without. This asymmetrical access to information vital to the United States as a democracy will eventually turn it into an autocracy run by those with access to secret information, protected by laws written to legitimate this privileged access and to punish those who violate these laws. Those with access to secret information cannot honestly partake in public discourse due to the requirement to lie and dissimulate about what is secret information. They can only speak to one another, never in public. Similarly those without access to secret information cannot fully debate the issues which affect the nation, including alleged threats promulgated by secret keepers who are forbidden by law to disclose what they know.134 We have reached the point where the classified information system prevents even trusted members of Congress, who have security clearances, from learning essential facts, and then inhibits them from discussing and debating what they do know. And this extends to matters of war and peace, money and blood. The “security state” is drowning in its own phlegm.135 It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.137 Foreign intelligence services also concur. For instance, in January of 2012 the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (the FBI of the Netherlands) published a report titled “Jihadism on the Web: A Breeding Ground for Jihad in the Modern Age.”140 This report describes a “Deep Web,” a set of obscure forums that are largely invisible to modern search engines.

These sites reside in the uncharted back alleys of the Internet, and constitute the online meeting spots where terrorists actually congregate: The AIVD estimates that approximately 25,000 jihadists originating from over 100 countries belong to this group of core Internet forums. Most of them operate on the so-called invisible Web, a part of the World Wide Web that has not (yet) been indexed and cannot be found by readily accessible search engines. The core forums hidden inside this invisible Web are constructed and maintained by fanatical jihadists. Within the confines of these virtual gathering places, all members can participate in interactive group discussions that lay the foundation for radical discourse, paving the way for legitimized violence against the enemies of “true” Islam. Jihadist organiza- Organized criminal gangs with comparable levels of sophistication take similar precautions. For example, the criminal gang Mara Salvatrucha has been known to use Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox 360 game consoles to establish covert channels of communication. The devices, designed explicitly towards multi-user online gaming, offer voice over IP (VoIP), text chat, and video teleconferencing features which give gang members the ability to interact with associates in other countries.141 The Mexican drug cartels take this out-of-band approach to a whole new level. They spent millions of dollars to create their own encrypted radio network from the ground up, an extensible series of antenna and repeaters that constitute a shadow communications system that reaches throughout most of Mexico’s thirty-one states.142 There is money to be made in the mass [interception] approach. We are learning that much of the snooping is farmed out to profit-seeking corporations that have great appetites for government contracts, secured through executives who enrich themselves by shuttling between agency jobs and the contractors’ board rooms.145 The article detailed an illegal domestic surveillance program run by a special unit within the CIA which targeted over 10,000 U.S. citizens involved in the antiwar movement and other dissident groups. Inside the CIA this initiative was known as “Operation CHAOS” and was geared towards unearthing “foreign influence” (i.e. communists).146 Operation CHAOS was launched under the auspices of Lyndon Johnson’s administration and, as you might expect, it gained even more traction under President Nixon. CHAOS wasn’t an isolated incident. A group of journalists and scholars at a non-profit called “The National Security Archive” have unearthed an NSA program called “Minaret.” Like Operation CHAOS, Minaret was a Vietnam-era watch list operation initiated under President Lyndon Johnson and continued by President Nixon.

A group of journalists and scholars at a non-profit called “The National Security Archive” have unearthed an NSA program called “Minaret.” Like Operation CHAOS, Minaret was a Vietnam-era watch list operation initiated under President Lyndon Johnson and continued by President Nixon. The program was supposedly launched to track suspected terrorists and drug traffickers. However, as the operation evolved, the White House requested surveillance of high-profile figures like Martin Luther King, New York Times journalist Tom Wicker, and Muhammad Ali, in addition to Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker. Reports derived from this monitoring were sent directly to the office of the President. Documents show that the NSA itself saw Minaret as “disreputable if not outright illegal” due to the complete absence of judicial oversight.147 Because we know that these recent documents were never expected to see the light of day, you have to know that honesty prevails throughout. There is no good reason to sugarcoat the comments. This is what they really think. They didn’t have to be coy about it. The NSA considers the American people to be its adversary, thus its use of the word adversary.149 But Alexander’s narrative has been brought into question by his own people. In a hearing that took place on July 31st, the NSA’s own Deputy Director John Inglis admitted that the NSA’s mass collection of phone metadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act had been pivotal in stopping only a single terror plot. In open session, directly, they can’t even say that seven years’ worth of phone records collection, basically a network of everyone’s social interactions conducted over the telephone, which is very easy to tell from metadata, for seven years, from all Americans, has maybe stopped one terrorist plot.154 The same sort of dynamic is at work on a local level. In the hunt for radical Islamists after 9/11, the New York Police Department went so far as to re-create its intelligence division from scratch. The police Commissioner went out and recruited a former high-ranking CIA officer named David Cohen to show him how to do it.158 The division launched an operation that was known as the NYPD’s demographics unit and sent a wave of undercover informants all over the city looking for terrorists. The operation, after years of building and maintaining files on Muslim-Americans, failed to produce as much as a single lead.159 Absolute data collection, however justified, leads to the mass destruction of personal autonomy, whether the collectors intend it or not….

When does the protector become the enemy?161 Based on what we’ve presented, it’s clear that both the govern-ment and the private sector are wielding high-powered surveillance tools to extract data from the Internet. Furthermore, though there is plenty of overt data collection, there is also interception (e.g. NSLs) that’s shielded by official secrecy. CSIS has ample individual connections to the defense industry through its advisors and trustees, including CSIS Senior Advisor Margaret Sidney Ashworth, Corporate Vice President for Government Relations at Northrop Grumman, and CSIS Advisor Thomas Culligan, Senior Vice President at Raytheon. CSIS President and CEO John Hamre is a director for defense contractor SAIC.164 Society is being blackmailed on the grounds of a false dichotomy: give up privacy or leaders can’t protect the public from the awful things that are going to happen. The essence of surveillance is control, and the more privacy that we yield the more control society hands over to the small group of people wielding the telescreens. If there is one more 9/11 – or worse, an attack involving nuclear material – it could lead to the end of the open society as we know it. If there were another 9/11, I fear that 99 percent of Americans would tell their members of Congress: “Do whatever you need to do to, privacy be damned, just make sure this does not happen again.” That is what I fear most.172 In other words, we must undermine constitutional liberty because a future terror attack might occur, one which might involve nuclear weapons. And if an attack like that occured it would surely mean the end of the Constitution. Using absurd logic, Friedman claims that we should undermine the Constitution in order to save it. Friedman intentionally neglects to acknowledge that the true threat to the U.S. constitution isn’t a terrorist attack, it’s how our leaders respond to an attack. During World War II the British Government produced a poster exhorting people, in the aftermath of German air strikes, to “keep calm and carry on.” Instead of clamping down on constitutional freedoms, decision makers could follow this maxim. With homage to Bruce Schneier, leaders could refuse to be terrorized. Germans have experienced firsthand what happens when the government knows too much about someone. In the past 80 years, Germans have felt the betrayal of neighbors who informed for the Gestapo and the fear that best friends might be potential informants for the Stasi.

Millions were monitored.173 Security and privacy are not two sides of an equation. This association is simplistic and largely fallacious. The best ways to increase security are not at the expense of privacy and liberty. Giving airline pilots firearms, reinforcing cockpit doors, better authentication of airport maintenance workers, armed air marshals travelling on flights and teaching flight attendants karate are all examples of suggested security measures that have no effect on individual privacy or liberties. Hunting down criminals on the Internet will always be an expensive, resource intensive proposition. Hunting down spies will be even harder than that, if not impossible, because national governments tend to make the necessary investments in anti-forensic technology. The examples that we surveyed in the second part of this book underscore these realities. 3) Barton Gellman, “Code name ‘Verax’: Snowden, in exchanges with Post reporter, made clear he knew risks,” Washington Post, June 9, 2013, http://www. washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/code-name-verax-snowdenin-exchanges-with-post-reporter-made-clear-he-knew-risks/2013/06/09/ c9a25b54-d14c-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_print.html. 23) Barton Gellman and Laura Poitras, ^(′′)U.S. , British intelligence mining data from nine U.S. Internet companies in broad secret program,” Washington Post, June 7, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_print.html. 30) Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, “NSA collects millions of e-mail address books globally,” Washington Post, October 14, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-addressbooks-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_print. html. 60) Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, “NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo!, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say,” Washington Post, October 30, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documentssay/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_print.html. 67) Privacy Impact Assessment, Publicly Available Social Media Monitoring and Situational Awareness Initiative, Office of Operations Coordination and Planning, Department of Homeland Security, June 22, 2010, http://www.dhs.gov/ xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_ops_publiclyavailablesocialmedia.pdf. 91) Andrea Peterson, “A CEO who resisted NSA spying is out of prison.

As shown earlier in the book, the verdict of cyberwar is a misdiagnosis. It implies a military problem, one which consequently lends itself to military solutions. But where does this leave people outside the United States? Cyber-attacks are a global phenomenon. Cyber-security is a universal need.

Ivan Arce, the CTO of Core Security Technologies, offers a view from outside: When a computer is breached, there’s a tendency to seek out simple explanations based on a single source with a direct chain of causality (“for want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” and so on). Despite the aesthetic appeal of such explanations, they’re at best an approximation of reality. A more nuanced approach is needed to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. Security incidents usually involve multiple factors that work together in concert on several levels (see Figure 11-1). There are exciting causes which lead directly to compromise. There are predisposing causes that work to reinforce the exciting causes. Finally there are remote causes that have a less immediate connection to what happened, but nevertheless play a role. In this chapter we’ll look at factors that exist at all three of these levels and offer potential paths towards remediation. Looking back through Part II of the book, it’s clear that users tend to do things they shouldn’t, much to the benefit of thieves and spies. This includes visiting web pages that execute a drive-by download, plugging in an infected thumb drive, or opening a booby-trapped attachment in an e-mail. By hook or by crook, malware gains a foothold with the assistance of the user. As you’ll recall from the chapter on cybercrime, there’s an entire industry of PPI services whose sole goal is to trick users into infecting their computers. Also, looking back through the chapter on espionage, spear-phishing was the attack vector of choice in practically all of the instances that we surveyed. Then there’s the perennial menace of poorly chosen passwords. For example, in the summer of 2012 hackers publicly released a list of almost half a million login credentials for Yahoo!. Of these passwords, over two thousand consisted of a sequential series of numbers (e.g. “123456”) and over 700 of these passwords simply used the word “password.”4 Granted there have been efforts to educate users on behalf of government agencies, like the NSA7 or US-CERT,8 and public-private sector partnerships, like the National Cyber Security Alliance.9 These efforts usually consist of publishing a basic guide with a series of tips for users on how to stay safe online. Sometimes problems arise because an organization fails to institute security measures that it knowingly could have. For example, in the aftermath of Operation Aurora, investigators discovered that Google stored its source code, its crown jewels, in an unprotected SCM system. Then there’s the TJX Hack, where a retail store relied on a wireless encryption scheme that was known to be insecure.

Then there’s the TJX Hack, where a retail store relied on a wireless encryption scheme that was known to be insecure. Let’s also not forget the Spamhaus DDoS, which was facilitated by a bunch of Internet service providers who failed to implement the recommendations spelled out in Best Current Practice #38 . In March of 2013, researchers posted an announcement on Seclists.org claiming to have commandeered more than 420,000 embedded devices using nothing more than empty or default credentials. Which is to say that people didn’t even bother to configure the devices with a password. The researchers stated: The agency [the IRS] had not always (1) implemented effective controls for identifying and authenticating users, such as enforcing password complexity on certain servers; (2) appropriately restricted access to its mainframe environment; (3) effectively monitored the mainframe environment; or (4) ensured that current patches had been installed on systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.12 Often there are political forces at work which compel an organization to adopt a less than optimal security profile. In a university environment, for instance, faculty members have been known to scream “academic freedom” the minute that someone suggests locking down machine settings. Security may also be sacrificed for ideological reasons at an Internet startup company where upper management dictates that everything should be in the cloud. With regard to promoting appropriate configurations, vendors like Microsoft have made some headway by introducing products, like its web server, which are closer to being secure by default. Microsoft has also worked towards establishing baseline configurations and best practices with tools like its Security Compliance Manager. Even careful users can have their computers breached. This includes systems run by the Department of Defense. Internet folklore has it that if you stick to “safe” web sites then you really don’t have to worry about drive-by downloads. In other words, if you’ve been hacked, it’s probably because you’ve been visiting porn sites or downloading pirated movies. The unpleasant reality is that it’s not uncommon for reputable sites, like those belonging to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, to serve up malicious web pages.13 Part of the problem is that high-traffic commercial portals often rely on ad networks like MSN and Google subsidiary DoubleClick to serve up web-based advertisements, and these providers can be tricked into placing malicious ad content.14 Over the six-month period ending in December of 2008, Websense Security Labs conducted a study which concluded: The notion that malware infections most commonly result from “risky” sites such as counterfeit software is a misconception.

Cisco’s analysis indicates that the vast majority of web malware encounters actually occur via legitimate browsing of mainstream websites. In other words, the majority of encounters happen in the places that online users visit the most – and think are safe.16 It comes down to this: you can educate and train users to the point that they’re obsessive-compulsive. You can meticulously impose draconian security settings (e.g. be completely “control compliant”) and monitor for the slightest deviation.17 But a well-crafted exploit, based on some obscure flaw that the software vendor didn’t catch, will sink your battleship every time. For many system administrators, it’s gotten to the point where public-facing servers are like children: they require constant attention, you never stop worrying about them, and the minute you look away they try to do something they are not supposed to. As the head of the NSA’s Information Assurance Directorate stated: n the nascent years of the software industry there was talk of a I software crisis.21 This concept was based on the observation that the design and implementation weren’t on equal footing with established engineering disciplines. The problems that researchers identified are largely still with us today, such that the crisis (which implies a brief duration) could probably be viewed as an enduring depression. Part of the problem is the attitude that software engineers have towards failure. When a building collapses due to a flawed design it’s treated as a major catastrophe by all parties involved (the architects, the engineers, the contractors, the owners, etc.). Furthermore, it’s unusual for a large-scale structure to be constructed on a design that’s based on substandard engineering. Not only will the architects and engineers recast the initial blueprints, they will also question the integrity of other buildings that use a similarly flawed design. In contrast to their engineering brethren in more traditional areas, software engineers have a comparatively blasé attitude about failure. Critical flaws, the type of bugs that can be used by attackers to breach the security of a computer, aren’t viewed as catastrophic. From the vantage point of the average software developer, critical bugs happen all the time. They simply shrug their shoulders and move on. Can you blame them? No, this mindset is encouraged from above. As the quotes at the start of this chapter indicate, management seems to think that “Done is better than perfect,” and engineers should “Move fast and break things.” In", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:143:88e345606e72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3271, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "that can be used by attackers to breach the security of a computer, aren’t viewed as catastrophic.

As the quotes at the start of this chapter indicate, management seems to think that “Done is better than perfect,” and engineers should “Move fast and break things.” In a sad fit of cognitive dissonance, these same executives have forgotten that “carelessness causes security incidents.” Bugs are so plentiful nowadays that there are literally automated tools for finding exploitable flaws in software. One proofof-concept tool designed by researchers, aptly named MAYHEM, not only identifies bugs but also spits out a working exploit.22 Furthermore, there has been research towards automating the attacks which leverage these software bugs so that the whole process of penetrating a network23 and wielding exploits to establish a foothold24 can be executed en masse by a small group of intruders. Take for example Adobe Reader, a preferred attack vector for black hats who create poisoned PDF documents. In the summer of 2008 Adobe released version 9 of the reader. Since that time Adobe has published well over 30 critical security advisories which describe flaws that could “cause the application to crash and could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.”25 You’d think that Adobe would learn its lesson after being publicly reprimanded like this. The release of Adobe Reader version X has been followed by a steady stream of similar critical security advisories. In fact, in December of 2011 a zero-day exploit for Reader version X was announced in the press, and reporters indicated that it was being used to breach networks belonging to defense contractors.28 The same holds true for Microsoft. While Internet Explorer 6 was a complete disaster from a security standpoint, serious flaws have continued to surface in later incarnations (i.e. versions 9 and 10). Since version 9’s release in the spring of 2011, there have been dozens of remote code execution vulnerabilities identified.29 Three generations after version 6, and drive-by downloads are still an active threat.30 In fact, while this book’s manuscript was being prepared in September of 2013, Microsoft announced an unpatched vulnerability that impacted all supported versions of Internet Explorer.31 It’s not just Microsoft’s browser either. The company’s flagship operating system, Windows 8, is also a ripe target which has been revealing a constant stream of critical bugs. Within days after Microsoft released Windows 8 in late October of 2012, the CEO of VUPEN, Chaouki Bekrar, announced via Twitter that his engineers had already developed the first operational zero-day exploit: Adobe and Microsoft aren’t alone.

Oracle’s Java platform has gained an industry-wide reputation for enabling attacks, as veritable wave after wave of critical flaws have been exposed. In January of 2013 the Java platform’s state of insecurity became so severe that the Department of Homeland Security recommended that users disable it.33 In the wake of this announcement, name brand companies like Apple34 and Twitter35 either told users to disable Java or went so far as to disable it automatically. While Oracle rushed to bolster Java’s security with an emergency software patch outside of its normal patch release cycle, dozens of new bugs quickly emerged to fill the void.36 This state of affairs prompted H.D. Moore, the original developer of the Metasploit penetration testing tool, to warn: Though raw shame goes a long way towards getting holes fixed, it’s not unheard of for a bug to go unpatched and ignored for long periods of time, simply because bugs are not viewed as threats by the people who make decisions about bug severity. Or perhaps an intelligence agency has made a special request. Either way, it’s also not unheard of for these same bugs to end up being exploited later on by clever attackers.38 Even worse, certain software vendors can be reticent about disclosing security problems and have been known to retaliate against researchers who discover them. For example, in the summer of 2011, a researcher named Dillon Beresford was gearing up to give a presentation at a security conference in Texas called TakeDown- A few months later, in the fall of 2011, security researcher Charlie Miller unearthed a flaw in Apple’s iOS operating system that could be used to download and execute malicious code. As a proof of concept, Miller created a fake stock ticker application that leveraged this flaw and submitted it for distribution at the Apple App Store, which validated the application as legitimate. After Miller disclosed the flaw, Apple revoked his application developer license and suspended him from Apple’s developer program.40 By silencing the messenger, with legal threats software and retaliation, vendors can maintain the appearance of security and avoid spending money on proactive audits, which is good enough as far as some executives are concerned. The industry as a whole seems to prefer a state of denial, which conveniently pretends that software is secure, and markets it as such … until some pesky researcher opens his mouth and generates a load of bad press.

As you might expect, the underlying reasons are often (but not always) financial. In criminal trials here in the United States the burden of proof is on the prosecution. In other words, you’re innocent until proven guilty. Likewise, our current attitude towards software security infers that users believe software to be secure until proven otherwise. Hence, there’s the presumption of security. The result of this mindset is what’s known as the patch-and-pray treadmill. Software is viewed as relatively secure until someone publicizes a zero-day exploit and pressures the vendor into admitting there’s a flaw and releasing a patch. At this point the software is again presumed to be secure, or at least you pray that it is. It’s the only alternative, really, because there’s no scientific method for conclusively determining if the patched software is any more secure. One possible response would be for people to throw up their arms and declare that it’s hopeless. To accept that critical software bugs are a fact of life and that society will just have to learn to live with shoddy products. Software vendors like this apology because it absolves them of responsibility. Security software vendors like it because it keeps them in business. But to surrender to this perspective is to choose the easy way out and completely negate the likelihood that software engineering, like other fields of engineering, will mature as a discipline. Society does not have to accept low-quality software as the status quo. Software engineering can evolve and advance. Tools exist that software engineers can use to create secure code.42 Gary McGraw, a well-known authority on software security, believes that focusing on the tools used to build software may be an attractive starting point.43 In other words, if you can limit the ability of a tool to create insecure code then you’ve made solid headway: C was a disaster, C + + was a disaster, Java was getting better, .NET was getting even better. You know, we’ve been moving slowly towards languages that at least have different sorts of vulnerabilities built into them, and make the job of software security easier. So I’d like to see a whole new class of languages that are designed with security right up front. And maybe we can get that accomplished in ten years. We analyze the system at design time for potential problems that we then correct. We test prototype devices to see how well they perform under stress or when used in ways beyond the normal specification.

We test prototype devices to see how well they perform under stress or when used in ways beyond the normal specification. Security acceptance testing not only exercises the product for its expected behavior given the expected environment and input sequences, but also tests the product with swings in the environment outside the specified bounds and with improper inputs that do not match the interface specification. We also test with proper inputs, but in an improper sequence. We anticipate malicious behavior and design to counter it, and then test the countermeasures for effectiveness. We expect the product to behave safely, even if not properly, under any of these stresses. If it does not, we redesign it.45 Some of the big vendors have made progress in this direction, or at least the perception of progress. For example, Microsoft has an assurance process it calls the “Security Development Lifecycle” (SDL).46 Oracle, too, has established an assurance program.47 To get a broader industry-wide view of where things are headed, you can glance over the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM). BSIMM is a framework for quantifying security practices based on a study of eighty-one software security initiatives executed by forty-two companies (including Adobe, EMC, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP).48 Business-types like metrics. They believe that unless you can measure a process you’re flying in the dark. Hence the utility of the BSIMM, in theory, is that it establishes universal metrics for the assurance initiatives. Not only that, but it goes beyond mere process to include social and organizational factors. For our purposes the Then again, some people may consider it disingenuous for a company to declare its code “trustworthy,” and even more dubious to believe that a sexy-sounding development process, whose efficacy has not been scientifically confirmed, can guarantee that code will actually be trustworthy, especially if the NSA has been involved. Certification appears to have taken a back seat to marketing. This is the case because software vendors aren’t penalized when they’re wrong. Take a standard server operating system like Windows Server 2008 R2. Microsoft originally launched its Trustworthy Computing Initiative back in 2001. The company launched the Server 2008 R2 product in the summer of 2009, nearly a decade later (so you’d think they had plenty of time to get things right). Service Pack 1 for this OS, a gigabyte-sized behemoth, was released on the ides of March in 2011.

In the months that followed the publication of Service Pack 1, Microsoft issued more than a dozen patches for flaws that could allow remote code execution (an average of more than one per month). Keep in mind that this is after Service Pack 1 had plugged two years of existing bugs. So while evangelists may laud the success of their assurance initiatives, the battle is far from over. This highlights less obvious historical forces. In the years before Microsoft released its first version of DOS, the domain of corporate I.T. was ruled by mainframe vendors like Control Data and IBM. These big iron systems were built from the ground up to be stable and available. It was viewed as a priority by the engineers because customers, who paid large sums of cash to purchase the mainframes, demanded it.50 Vendors would literally monitor the machines they sold to ensure that they caught problems early so that the machines didn’t go down. Microsoft’s early operating systems targeted the low-end of the market. The fundamental strategy was to gain market share by providing cheap software that was “good enough.” Even something as basic as application memory protection was nonexistent. If an early Windows machine crashed, the user would shrug their shoulders and reboot. Contrast this to the high-end arena, where a vendor could expect a prompt phone call from angry executives if their multi-million dollar installation went down. Only in the past ten years, or so, has Microsoft started making inroads into the high-end of the enterprise. Their flagship server products continue to be haunted by the “good enough” mentality which allowed Microsoft to dominate the low-end of corporate computing. Even Germany, presumably an ally of the U.S., has shown qualms about deploying Windows 8 on computers with the latest Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. TPM chips store cryptographic keys. These keys are used to verify the integrity of the operating system. According to the Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security: Hence while officials persistently warn of hardware that’s been tampered with by foreign intelligence agencies, it appears that other countries are just as concerned about the United States adding some special sauce into the technology that we export to them. As we discussed back in Chapter Six, these suspicions are completely justified.

As if it wasn’t bad enough that software quality falters so badly, the tools that most people rely on to catch malware are also lacking. It’s common knowledge that malware authors, as a matter of standard operating procedure, test their creations against a battery of different anti-virus products to ensure that they can evade detection.55 Recall earlier in the book how F-Secure’s chief research officer, Mikko Hypponen, openly admitted that the anti-virus industry was out of its league in its own game.56 None of the solutions on offer from the AV [anti-virus] industry give us any hope against a determined targeted attack. While the AV companies all gave talks around the world dissecting the recent publicly discovered attacks like Stuxnet or Flame, most glossed over the simple fact that none of them discovered the virus till after it had done its work.57 Microsoft’s Security Essentials anti-virus technology performs so poorly in tests that the company has adopted what it refers to as a baseline strategy. That is, Microsoft suggests that users should only rely on Security Essentials as a backstop and install a dedicated anti-virus package from another vendor for additional protection.58 In early 2013 there was a flurry of stories about media outlets like the Wall Street Journal, 59 the Washington Post, 60 and the New York Times, 61 being targeted by long-term cyber campaigns. A spokesman for the New York Times, in particular, stated that anti-virus software from Symantec was deployed on all of the machines in the company’s network, and yet it failed to detect the malware used by the intruders.62 Symantec released an official statement in response, explicitly claiming that “anti-virus software alone is not enough.”63 To add insult to injury, enterprise security software sold by companies like Symantec and McAfee itself has been known to sport critical bugs which can be leveraged by attackers.64 Can you imagine entrusting the well-being of a server farm to an expensive security solution only to have intruders turn around and use it to compromise the entire network of machines? It’s like a police department led by a corrupt chief. Another factor that allows cyber-attacks to flourish is their in-ternational nature. If operators can find a permissive setting literally operate out in the open. The Koobface gang in St. Petersburg, Russia, is a definitive example.

Here’s another example. In the book Fatal System Error the author, journalist Joseph Menn, recounts a story where a detective from the United Kingdom, Andrew Crocker, traveled to the Russian city of Astrakhan in pursuit of a hacker who went by the handle of “Zet.” Per standard protocol, Crocker notified the local police chief of Astrakhan, Alexander Petrov, in advance of his arrival, and Petrov was nice enough to take him out to dinner when he arrived. During the course of the greet-and-eat, Petrov insisted that he and Crocker grab some guns and go boar hunting. Petrov, it turns out, was the father of the hacker named Zet. While flawed software is arguably the most severe threat that try that encourage this to be the case. The broad proliferation of bugs is actually a function of the market in which software vendors operate. The current state of affairs didn’t spontaneously appear. Society’s cyber-insecurity is the logical, if not predictable, consequence of economic forces at work. Enterprise software vendors like Microsoft are corporations. Like any publicly traded corporation, they need to cater to the mandates of Wall Street and turn a profit. Traditionally, Microsoft has targeted the low-end of the computing spectrum, where it has been incredibly successful. Recently Microsoft has been making headway in the mid-range segment with its server software product line. In these zones of the market, users demand two things: cheap software and new features. To survive as a profitable company, Microsoft has had to meet these demands. There’s an old story that Tim Jackson describes in his book Inside Intel. It’s about a team of software engineers at Intel who identified a snippet of code in Microsoft Excel that, when slightly modified, increased the execution speed 8-fold. They called up the engineers at Microsoft to let them know what they had found so that they could include the improvement. The engineers at Microsoft brushed them off, claiming: From a business perspective, this makes sense. Tracking down bugs and conducting the security audits necessary to unearth them is a resource-intensive process. It’s so complicated and grueling that guys like Charlie Miller can make their living finding bugs. Why would a profit-driven company devote time and money to securing an existing product, much less supporting an outdated legacy product, when it could just add a bunch of new features", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:150:a2fcba6acfda", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3278, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "the improvement.

Tracking down bugs and conducting the security audits necessary to unearth them is a resource-intensive process. It’s so complicated and grueling that guys like Charlie Miller can make their living finding bugs. Why would a profit-driven company devote time and money to securing an existing product, much less supporting an outdated legacy product, when it could just add a bunch of new features and sell it to users as the next edition? Most users have no idea what a zero-day exploit is, anyway, much less how to evaluate the security of a software package. Thus, unknown critical security flaws can be conveniently overlooked, and the corresponding product miraculously deemed “secure,” until an independent researcher comes forward with an unpleasant discovery. This approach effectively outsources the task of security auditing to a third-party (one who often works at a steep discount) and turns the user-base into a bunch of glorified beta testers. But, then again, why spend resources up front finding bugs, bugs that otherwise might never surface, when it’s relatively cheaper to put the marketing folks into damage control mode and issue a patch? This is the calculus that software companies abide by. Clarke’s comments deserve some qualification. Obviously, Microsoft has major competitors in the consumer device market, and the company does appear to have invested in its Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) assurance program. Conversely, the company continues to churn out new products on a regular basis and critical security flaws likewise continue to sprout up every month, lending credence to the notion that aforementioned market forces continue to prevail. In economics, a negative externality is a consequence of production that damages society as a whole without impacting the bottom line of the producer. Pollution from manufacturing plants is a common negative externality in places like China where environmental regulation is weak. In the software industry, as things stand now, the costs of cleaning up after security incidents that result from software bugs are a negative externality. Vendors aren’t in business to do the right thing; they’re in business to make money. To add insult to injury, the resources that both individual users and victimized organizations themselves spend to clean up after incidents don’t necessarily make any progress towards fundamentally improving software security. As an afterthought, software companies have been known to offer rewards for security researchers who identify bugs in their products. This practice generates good press, and helps to create the perception that security is a genuine priority. As such, it can be viewed by more skeptical eyes as a marketing gimmick. For example, Google periodically shells out a wad of cash,68 sometimes as much as $60, 4000, 7 to anyone to can find a new way to compromise the company’s Chrome browser.

Microsoft has also announced that it’s willing to pay up to $100, 000 for researchers who identify critical bugs in its products.70 Bug bounties essentially outsource quality control to independent third parties working at a steep discount. Unfortunately, as we saw earlier in the book, there’s a thriving industry devoted to selling zero-day exploits. The very existence of this shadowy global market, which caters to the highest bidder, underscores the reality that peddling malware is much more profitable than collecting a token reward and a public pat on the head. It’s pretty clear that demand in the black market has outstripped the modest corporate reward system. In addition, not every zero-day exploit bought by the government would be used defensively to patch holes in software. Some of the purchased zero-day exploits would be used in offensive operations by U.S. intelligence services. Do you suppose other nations would feel safe if the United States possessed a near monopoly with regard to zero-days? More likely than not, a campaign to hoard zero-day exploits on behalf of the U.S. would merely drive up prices, as arms dealers played one government against another. While accidental bugs are a reality, so are also intentional bugs. Though much of this chapter appears to place the blame forbad security on sloppy engineering, this picture is incomplete. As described earlier in the book, our government plays a role in subverting cyber-security, much to the financial glee of the defense sector. Back in Chapter Six, we introduced the malware industrial complex; an entire industry devoted to subversion. These companies thrive because of buggy software, flaws and weaknesses that sometimes arise inadvertently and other times are intentionally planted on behalf of intelligence agencies. The products this malware industry sells are used by governments and independent actors to execute clandestine operations. The growing demand for weaponized exploits provides financial motivations which ensure that software bugs remain secret. This market makes it much more profitable to package and sell flaws as exploits rather than publicize them. Secrecy of this kind makes it less likely that vendors will take corrective action and release patches. Because the flaws aren’t addressed, society as a whole is put in a more vulnerable position. All of this occurs on behalf of organizations that want to perform cyber-attacks. Some government agencies have tried to distance themselves from the seedier elements of the digital arms trade by developing exploits in-house.

Some government agencies have tried to distance themselves from the seedier elements of the digital arms trade by developing exploits in-house. The problem with this is that the unearthed exploits still remain a secret. Vendors will remain oblivious to the discovered flaw or perhaps be induced by government officials to ignore it on behalf of national security. Either way, the corresponding bugs go unfixed and the bulk of society goes unprotected. But things get even more twisted. Black market sellers can, in fact, cash out twice by turning around and selling custom detection tools at a hefty premium.73 Thus, not only do they sell malware, but they sell the tools that detect it. It’s like a rogue bioengineer selling a custom bioweapon and the vaccine to cure it, all to the highest bidder. While politicians and generals often make frenzied accusations about China inserting back doors into hardware and software, this serves only to distract us from U.S. treachery. According to anonymous sources within the government, thousands of hi-tech companies voluntarily provide sensitive information to U.S. security services so that they can infiltrate computers belonging to anyone viewed as an “enemy.” The list of collaborators, known as “trusted partners,” includes big names like Microsoft: Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world’s largest software company, provides intelligence agencies with information about bugs in its popular software before it publicly releases a fix, according to two people familiar with the process. That information can be used to protect government computers and to access the computers of terrorists or military foes.74 This puts the behavior of our intelligence officials in a whole new light, because while they’re clamoring about cyber-Armageddon on one hand, they’re simultaneously neck deep in the black market for weaponized malware, collaborating with vendors to insert back doors, and doing everything they can to sabotage mainstream encryption technology. The government is actively perpetrating the same acts of economic espionage and sabotage that it publicly disparages. Now perhaps it’s clear why India, China, and Russia are working on developing their own operating systems. Furthermore, do you suppose this casts doubt on the viability of global Cloud Services which use platforms based on technology developed by U.S. hi-tech companies? The intelligence community within the government benefits from keeping attacks secret so that they can be deployed against our enemies, and very likely stockpiles zero-day exploits for this offensive purpose. There is then pressure to selectively harden sensitive targets while keeping the attack secret from everyone else and leaving popular software vulnerable. This is “security for the 1% ,” and it makes the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt:153:fa5b8cae0580", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3281, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584801", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584801_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 154, "text": "the viability of global Cloud Services which use platforms based on technology developed by U.S. hi-tech companies?

A citizen trying to get security against authoritarians is likely to be accused of aiding and abetting national enemies of free markets. The consequence is a campaign to promote the notion that an innocent citizen has nothing to hide from the biggest players in security – governments and their contractors conjoined by agreements to keep the best security highly secret and out of reach of citizens, thereby treating tax-paying and gullible citizens as enemies. This is where the offensive approach to cyber-security will take us. Cold War strategies based on massive retaliation will inevitably lead governments to frantically engage in surreptitious malware development and software subversion. The same holds true for strategies that advocate preemptive attacks. Indeed, any approach that revolves around aggressive action will only serve to accelerate the arms race. Cyber-attacks will proliferate via pricey custom tools and backroom deals with vendors. The malware industrial complex will flourish. The average user, relying on buggy software and commodity security software, will be the primary loser. This top-down model sacrifices security for the 99% by relegating high-security to cabals of spies and criminals. 60) Craig Timberg and Ellen Nakashima, “Chinese hackers suspected in attack on The Post’s computers,” Washington Post, February 1, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/chinese-hackers-suspected-in-attack-onthe-posts-computers/2013/02/01/d5a44fde-6cb1-11e2-bd36-c0fe61a205f6_ print.html. Why should normal citizens suffer the fallout of poor se-curity so that a select group of organizations can launch covert operations? Why should higher levels of security be the sole domain of classified and “critical” networks? Why can’t security grow organically from the bottom up? If individual citizens are secure, then aren’t nations as a whole more secure? As we’ve demonstrated, the same cannot be said for the top-down approach. Fortifying a small group of allegedly high-value targets doesn’t necessarily do much for Mr. and Mrs. Smith when they go online. he software industry needs to reorient its mindset towards failure.

Truly robust implementations, which possess inherent fault tolerance, are often referred to as self-healing. There are those who promote reactive measures. But as the DEA can corroborate, a law enforcement approach that focuses on interdiction, apprehension, and harsh sentencing has done little to halt the flow of drugs into the United States. It only leads to a perpetual, and costly, struggle against heavily armed cartels that sprout up in response to poverty on one side of our border and heavy demand on the other. Prevention, education, and treatment are what stifle the demand that fuels the drug trade. Hence, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure; which is to say that investing in prevention offers a much higher return on investment than pouring money into response. Hence, we believe that the first tier needs to be reexamined. To this end there are a couple of strategies that merit attention. In the years following World War II, the Soviet nuclear program was the focus of a vast intelligence campaign on behalf of U.S. intelligence agencies. To counter this effort, the Soviets utilized elaborate, multi-level, denial and deception strategies. According to Mikhail Gladyshev, who was in charge of the plutonium enrichment station at the Mayak complex in the city of Ozersk, compartmentalization of information was very strict: [W]e put the [plutonium] paste in a box and transferred it to the consumer plant. How much plutonium was in that box we didn’t know and it was not recommended for us to know. Even later, when I was the plant’s chief engineer, the plans for plutonium production were known only to the facility’s director, and all documents were prepared in single copies.3 You know what is absolutely moronic about this breach? WHY do you have to have trade secrets on network facing equipment? In this day and age with all the breaches and other nasties happening out there, wouldn’t most companies think it would be wise to keep their trade secrets on a separate internal network that is not connected to the Internet? How often does the source code have to be accessed?6 There are a number of breaches which we’ve surveyed that probably could have been prevented if air-gap security had been implemented. The idea behind air-gap security is simple: relegate sensitive data to a special-purpose network that is physically separated from other networks. The experts trust this approach.

For example, Bruce Schneier used air-gap security while working with documents disclosed by Ed Snowden.7 In ultra-high security environments, machines in air-gapped network are electromagnetically shielded with wire mesh (i.e. what’s known as a “Faraday cage”) to prevent TEMPEST emanation. While air-gap security raises the bar that an attacker must surmount, even with an isolated network there’s the risk that malware will gain entry when data needs to be exchanged between the isolated network and the outside world. This is exactly how the perimeter of CENTCOM was breached. The same holds in the case of Stuxnet, which propagated in the absence of an outside network connection. To defend against this, companies like San Francisco-based Cryptography Research have tackled the issue of data exchange using a dedicated USB drive that’s wiped clean after each use.8 To be even more wary, optical media could be leveraged to transfer data in an encrypted format. Obviously as inter-network bandwidth needs increase, this becomes a less efficient solution.

As early as they calle of Heroi 3400 b.c. ., the Sumerians used the opium poppy, which y plant,” for its euphoric effects. In The Politics omplicity in the Global Drug Trade, University of Wisconsin Professor Alfred McCoy explains that most opium, and its derivative heroin, still comes from poppies grown in the northern section of former Sumerian lands and adjoining territories. Today, this includes a narrow 4,500-mile stretch of mountains extending along the southern tier of Asia, from Turkey through Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to India, an area known as the “Golden Crescent.” That same stretch of mountains then extends to the world’s second largest area of poppy cultivation in the “Golden Triangle,” where Myanmar (formerly Burma), Thailand and Laos come together adjacent to Vietnam.1 Access to an abundance of opium poppies by Western industrialized countries brought centuries of problems to the East, particularly in China. There, in the early 1500s, the Chinese had only used opium medicinally and in oral form. During this time the Portuguese fleet initiated the smoking of opium in China, discovering that the effects of smoking opium were instantaneous. The Chinese, however, considered the practice barbaric and subversive.4 In the early 1700s, the Dutch took over trade with China and the islands of Southeast Asia, while popularizing the use of a tobacco pipe for opium smoking. In 1729, the Emperor Yung Cheng issued an edict prohibiting the smoking of opium and its domestic sale, except under license for use as a medicine.5 By 1750, the British East India Company had taken control of several opium-growing regions of India, and by the 1790s had developed a monopoly on the opium trade. China’s new emperor, Kia King, then banned opium completely.

China’s new emperor, Kia King, then banned opium completely. This failed to stop the British East India Company from increasing their smuggling and sale of opium in China, which grew from 15 tons a year in the earlier 1700s to 3,200 tons a year by 1850.6 American University Professor Clarence Lusane argued that once Britain had developed its empire, it used opium as an important new political tool for conquest. The British, he wrote, used opium to help addict and control the Chinese people en masse, increasing British profits in China and allowing them easier access to China’s resources.7 Statements of high-level Chinese officials support this argument. In 1836, mandarin Hsu Nai-tsi, vice president of the Sacrificial Court, informed the emperor that opium, originally ranked among the medicines, was now being inhaled. Hsu called the practice “destructive … injurious,” and despite its ban in 1799, the foreign “barbarian merchants” helped it “spread throughout the entire empire.” Mandarin Chun Tsu, a member of the Board of Rites, found that within the Chinese army, “a great number of the soldiers were [opium] smokers; so that, although their numerical force was large there was hardly any force found among them.” Chu proclaimed the Chinese needed to oppose the “covetous and ambitious schemes” of the British with their opium sales.8 By 1839, the British East India Company’s shipments of opium to China reached 1,400 tons per year. The Chinese premier tried to outlaw foreign ships from bringing opium into Chinese ports for sale. Chinese officials confiscated 15,000 chests containing 95 tons of opium from foreign merchants, including 10 tons from the American firm Russell & Co. They dissolved the opium in a trench of water with salt and lime.9 Unwilling to lose the political power opium had given it, Britain attacked China in the first Opium War, which lasted three years until 1842. China then signed a peace treaty giving Hong Kong to Britain. China kept opium illegal, but stopped confiscations. However, when Chinese officials tried to enforce the prohibition of British opium sales, tensions led to the second Opium War (1856-1858).

France’s Le Monde Diplomatique said that “HSBC’s first wealth came from opium from India, and later Yunan in China.” Yunan is in the Golden Triangle area. The first Opium War forced China to cede Shanghai to Western powers, transforming it from a fishing village to China’s largest, most modern city with a network of opium smoking dens. Prof. Alfred McCoy would eventually call Hong Kong “Asia’s heroin laboratory,” and HSBC would become the world’s second largest bank. By 1900 China had an estimated thirteen million opium addicts. Six years later, 27% of all adult males in China smoked opium. This astounding rate of addiction has never since been equaled. Other Asian countries developed similar public addiction issues when forced to participate in the drug trade by European powers. Corrupt, foreign-supported leaders in these countries may have also been motivated to make money on the side through taxing opium sales.11 However, the opium-trafficking families of the U.S. and Europe made the most money, as they bought most of the 35,000 metric tons of raw opium being produced in 1906 and sold it at a premium once it was processed. This was 85% of the world opium production that year and more than four times as much from any other single source in history. Most of this opium production took place in southern China, adjoining the area considered the Golden Triangle of opium production in Laos, Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar) and Vietnam.12 British rulers appeared to also use opium against British citizens who struggled to better their living conditions. Famous British resident Karl Marx coined the term “opiate of the masses” about opium abuse and addiction keeping people politically asleep. The timing of the ill effects of the industrial revolution—worker displacement, starvation and rioting in the early 1800s—suggests that British rulers promoted opiates to help quell the masses of poor and struggling workers, many of whom joined protests.13 After a particularly turbulent eight years of rioting and protest, in 1819 British Parliament passed the Six Acts, turning Britain into a police state. These acts prevented public meetings, restricted newspapers, sped up the judicial process and restricted access to firearms. Within ten years, street patrols of police were introduced. In 1827, the first commercial batches of the opium derivative morphine were produced14 Opium distribution for medicinal and recreational use in industrialized European countries led to problems among their own poor and working classes.

Professor Lusane cited Karl Marx in Capital, which stated that in 1861, 26 percent of deaths among English children resulted from their working-class parents treating the children’s ailments with opiate medicines. As Prof. Al McCoy also reported, mass addiction to opium became a significant feature of the late 1800s in England.15 tarting in the 1700s, the British East India Company acquired a number Sof partners among American families from New England. The opium merchants’ power and loyalty extended to their American partners, and the American anglophiles showed their continued commitment to Britain by becoming part of the reported 15% of Americans who fought for the British as Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War.16 In his book, Pipe Dream Blues: Racism and the War on Drugs, Professor Clarence Lusane argues that British aristocracy and many of America’s wealthiest families used alcohol and drugs as weapons, not only in the East, but also in Africa and in the Americas, with New England families dominating the rum trade. Lusane notes that prior to European influence, Africans traditionally drank only palm wine. Other intoxicants were used medicinally and in moderation. European traders introduced rum, tobacco and opium to Africa for economic gain, swindling African traders when gathering captured slaves, and also introduced rum in the Americas to lead a large percentage of Native Americans into dysfunction.17 The American families smuggling opium into China alongside the British included the prominent Russell family of Connecticut. The Russells intermarried with other rich families, including the Pierponts, the family that later spawned tycoon Julius Pierpont “J.P.” Morgan. Over a halfdozen of the richest families, including the Cabots, Cushings, Astors, and Perkinses, gained huge wealth in the opium trade and went on to attain positions of power in the U.S. In just one single year (1840) these New Englanders brought 24,000 pounds of opium into the U.S.18 of the Cabot opium-trafficking family founded Harvard’s Porcellian Club, called the Porc or Pig Club by critics. The Russell Company unabashedly used the skull-and-bones pirate symbol in its international opium shipping. In 1856, a Skull and Bonesman, Daniel Coit Gilman, co-incorporated the Russell Trust Association, the opiumtrafficking Russell family’s fund, which then started bestowing money to Skull and Bones members. The Russell Trust reportedly granted each Skull and Bonesman $15, 000 , the equivalent of $255, 000 in 2010 dollars, upon their graduation.

In time, many of these Bonesmen rose to the ranks of the most powerful people in the world.19 Germany introduced heroin as a commercial product. Bayer introduced its milder pain reliever, aspirin, one year later. Both drugs were mass-marketed on a similar scale, with heroin being touted as a “non-addictive” cure for adult ailments and infant respiratory diseases. Other companies followed suit and mass marketed heroin throughout Europe and America, with the American Medical Association’s approval of heroin as a non-addictive morphine substitute.20 The next thirty years were a time of great political upheaval in the United States. Socialist and anarchist newspapers thrived both in the cities, particularly among recent immigrants, and in the rural areas where homegrown leftist activists gained a readership. This widespread radical leftist political activism came on the heels of the American Industrial Revolution, which followed a few decades after Europe’s Industrial Revolution. In the European countries, the newly rich industrialists stood in opposition to the old money of the royal families. Columbia University sociologists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven described how these European industrialists and royal families competed for the workers’ allegiance. This gave the workers more leverage to gain concessions, such as better workplace conditions and national health care. Piven and Cloward noted the marked difference between European and American labor history. When the industrialists rose up in the U.S. after the 1860s Civil War, there was no aristocracy standing in opposition to them. As workers in the factories tried to organize for better wages and conditions, the industrialists initially used violence against them, but soon employed more sophisticated strategies.21 The opium-trafficking families ramped up their importation of drugs by the end of the 1800s. Companies marketed much of the imported opium and its first derivative, morphine, in medicines. But at least a quarter of imported opium was intended for smoking. By 1900 over 1% of the U.S. population was addicted to opium. Addiction to opium, particularly heroin, rose “at alarming rates” in 1903, in parallel with a rise of worker activism.22 During this time period, women organized for the right to vote. In the 1870s, police arrested Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth for their efforts in this cause. In 1890, the National American Woman Suffrage Association was created to promote women’s voting rights. Many of these activist women also fought for anti-lynching laws and formed groups fighting for better working conditions.23 By the 1890s and early 1900s women made up two-thirds to three-quarters of opium addicts.24 ale University Professor David Musto wrote that opiate addiction reached its peak in the early", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:4:f8f57eee8c6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3289, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "In the 1870s, police arrested Susan B.

The opiate-addict population nearly doubled the rate of addiction today. It is unknown how many only “abused” opiates without developing a full-fledged addiction. Abuse alone could generally be enough to fill up users’ free time and disincline their political and social activism.25 At the turn of the century, cocaine addiction became almost as widespread as opiate addiction. This appeared to have its genesis in 1886 when, during the early stages of the Progressive Movement, the Georgia counties of Atlanta and Fulton passed alcohol prohibition legislation. In response, a Georgia pharmacist, John Pemberton, developed Coca-Cola, a non-alcoholic version of French Wine Coca. He developed the original formula for Coca-Cola, containing 2.5mg of cocaine per 3.3 ounces of fluid. The syrup had 5 ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, an addictive amount for those with the susceptibility. This formula was sold as a headache cure and stimulant.26 A wealthy Atlanta pharmacist, Asa Candler, bought exclusive rights to the Coca-Cola formula and incorporated Coca-Cola in 1892. Manufacturers sold cocaine in a wide range of patent medicines, tonics, elixirs and fluid extracts at that time. Asa Candler and his wealthy investors put massive amounts of money into advertising his new drink for sale in popular drug-store fountains all over the U.S. and Canada. It soon became America’s most popular drink. By 1902, cocaine-related products provided many ways to access the drug on a daily basis. This led to an estimated 200,000 cocaine addicts in the United States. Between 1900 and 1907, U.S. coca leaf imports tripled. Hundreds of early Hollywood silent films depicted scenes of drug use and trafficking.27 Meanwhile, leftist workers organizing for better work conditions gained help from investigative magazines that exposed corrupt companies. Together, these organizers and writers helped bring the reform-minded president Theodore Roosevelt into office in 1901. Roosevelt, who also founded the Progressive Party in 1912, helped gain the passage of anti-trust laws to break up the robber barons’ monopolies over certain industries. When these tycoons bought out all their competition in an industry, they could raise prices as high as they liked. During the Roosevelt administration, many laws and regulations were instituted to give the average American a “Square Deal,” or a chance to make a fair living without getting robbed by the rich.28 Professor Musto detailed how the Progressive Movement of the late 1800s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:5:35146a76429a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3290, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "helped gain the passage of anti-trust laws to break up the robber barons’ monopolies over certain industries.

Morgan families bought out all the top investigative magazines that contributed to American political reform.30 By 1915, J.P. Morgan also bought out the major newspapers. The Congressional Record revealed that in 1915, J.P. Morgan’s “‘steel, shipbuilding and powder interests’ had purchased control of twenty-five great newspapers … to control generally the policy of the daily press of the United States.”31 Control of the media aided the Rockefellers, the J.P. Morgan family, and their fellow intermarried, wealthy families. In 1917, they swayed public opinion and influenced the United States to aid England in World War I. While tens of thousands of Americans died after the U.S. entered the war, these wealthy families made huge profits from moneylending, steel manufacturing for armaments, and oil sales for trucks, tanks, railroads and airplanes.32 ontrol of the media aided the creation of the first “Red Scare.” CResearchers say the Russian Revolution of 1917 scared the wealthiest in all the capitalist countries. The Russian Revolution took land from the wealthy and redistributed it to the poor. It took ownership of the factories and gave it to councils of workers. In response, to make sure nothing fomented in the U.S, the corporate owners, including the Rockefellers, Russells, Morgans, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Harrimans and Bushes, helped propagate a Red Scare through the media. Their tactics led to the Sedition Act of 1918, which criminalized many behaviors formerly seen as merely unpatriotic. Legislators also passed laws directed at immigrants, leading to imprisonment and deportation of people for radical or anarchist political beliefs.33 Evidence supports the case that U.S. intelligence framed Italian anarchist organizers Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti before their trial and execution.34 In 1919 and 1920, U.S. Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, and his young functionary J. Edgar Hoover, started a mass arrest of immigrant workers nationwide. These were known as the “Palmer Raids.” Hoover led the “Alien Radical” division of the vastly expanded Bureau of Investigation (soon the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI).

These were known as the “Palmer Raids.” Hoover led the “Alien Radical” division of the vastly expanded Bureau of Investigation (soon the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI). Estimates of the numbers of Italian, Russian and other immigrants arrested for “radical subversion” in one massive dragnet ranged from 3,000 to 19,000 persons.35 Some of the still-independent press complained, as did some members of Congress. The Immigration Act of 1920 initially sought to help victims of the Palmer Raids. It ended up making possession of radical literature, and even sympathy for activist causes, punishable offenses for immigrants, referred to as “aliens.” Criminal syndicalism charges started in most states, and were used to repress socialist and anarchist political organizing. In 1903 the State Militias had been organized by Congress into what would become the National Guard, for additional peacetime repression.36 Yet again, toward the end of the 1940s, U.S. intelligence, politicians and journalists created a second Red Scare. The U.S. House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), along with a similar Senate committee led by Senator Joe McCarthy, held hearings to root out Communists, suspected Communists, and “fellow travelers.” Many were jailed, thousands more were blacklisted, even for leftist leanings, making it impossible for them to find jobs in their fields, most notably in the film industry and the arts. The FBI visited employers and warned them not to hire such people.37 They also interrogated friends and relatives of suspected “pinko” targets. The CIA appeared to attack such targets out of concern for anyone infringing on their own attempt to mold people’s hearts and minds.38 A government memorandum showed CIA plans to set a particular example of two Communist activists. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of treason for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. They became the only people executed for treason during peacetime. Later, published evidence supported the possibility of their innocence.39 These events demonized Italian and Jewish leftist communities and left them fearful of participating in activism.40 Politicians further directed legislation at workers’ organizations, such as the Industrial Workers of the World, nicknamed the Wobblies. The Wobblies used sitdown strikes to gain many workers’ rights. Starting in 1917, the U.S. Justice Department and War Department, with many high posts held by the Rockefellers, Harrimans and Bush tycoons, ordered troops to invade Wobbly headquarters, broke up Wobbly meetings, and took Wobblies hostage without charges. The Postmaster suspended scores of second-class mailing permits for progressive newspapers and magazines, based on minor infractions, while the Justice Department closed down socialist newspapers and deported the Italian immigrant publisher of the top anarchist paper.41 n 1902, Daniel Coit Gilman, the man who incorporated the Russell Trust", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:7:2025b6abefb5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3292, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "Department and War Department, with many high posts held by the Rockefellers, Harrimans and Bush tycoons, ordered troops to invade Wobbly headquarters, broke up Wobbly meetings, and took Wobblies hostage without charges.

One of Gilman and the Carnegies’ first projects was the genocidal “eugenics” agenda. Awardwinning syndicated columnist Edwin Black wrote about the Eugenics Movement exhaustively in his book, War Against the Weak. Black had his manuscript for the book peer-reviewed and corrected before publication. He noted that the word “eugenics” derived from the Greek for “well born.”42 Black described how the Rockefellers, Harrimans, Carnegies, and the J.P. Morgan family used their money and influence to pass laws in a majority of American states that led to the sterilization of poor people and immigrants. The wealthiest enlisted military researchers to invent biased IQ tests, called Alpha and Beta tests. These tests used wealthy white cultural examples from the early 1900s, such as asking what was missing from a tennis court or bowling alley. The tests purported to prove that ^(*)47% of whites generally, 70% of Jews and 89% of Negroes were deserving of elimination.” Asian and Latino immigrants were also targeted as inferior.43 Officials further used sly and unsavory means to kill poor Americans. Incoming patients at certain hospitals were fed milk from tubercular cows, resulting in a thirty- to forty-percent annual death rate. Such hospitals and institutions were often the only ones in poor areas, like the Illinois Institution for the Feebleminded in the Chicago area in Lincoln, Illinois.44 Ivy League universities, as well as Stanford, Johns Hopkins and others, received funding from eugenicists to lend legitimacy to the fraudulent pseudoscience. The Journal of the American Medical Association supported eugenics in many of its articles, aiding the passage of sterilization legislation in 27 states. These states also passed legislation against mixed-race marriages.45 The Eugenics Movement had its founding national office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York.46 In 1928, the Ford Company and the Rockefellers interlocked their companies with the giant German chemical company I.G. Farben (which included heroin-introducer Bayer). All three companies played major roles in Nazi Germany. I.G. Farben gave massive funds for Hitler’s election, helped him initiate and wage his wars, and ended up running the largest concentration camp—Auschwitz.

Black further documented that the Ford Company used slave labor from the Buchenwald concentration camp. 47 London’s Guardian reviewed U.S. documents and found the Harriman and Bush families joined these other groups in helping fund the rise of the Nazis. George H.W. Bush’s father, Prescott Bush, managed the elite British-American banking venture, Brown Brothers Harriman. BBH worked behind the back of the British government on behalf of the government’s opponents, the British royalty. Former Brown Brothers partner Montagu Norman, a Bank of England Governor, was reportedly a Hitler supporter. The bank also worked behind the back of President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration. BBH and Bush-Harriman steel and shipping companies kept up joint ventures with German steel mogul, Fritz Thyssen. In his autobiography, I Paid Hitler, Thyssen boasted of helping finance Hitler’s rise to power.48 Brown Brothers Harriman’s Silesian Steel owned German steel and coalmines, and their Hamburg-Amerika shipping line spread pro-Nazi propaganda in the U.S. and Germany.49 IBM also offered huge support to the Nazis. Edwin Black’s bestseller, IBM and the Holocaust, detailed how IBM first used its Hollarinth punch cards to systematize the extermination of Europe’s Jews, gypsies, Communists, socialists, anarchists and homosexuals. IBM employees conducted door-to-door censuses, and processed all of the information onto punch cards. These cards acted as the key codes to the earliest versions of computers, and kept the data necessary for identifying and speeding up the execution of so many people. Six million Jews and five million people from these other groups were killed on the spot or sent to one of at least 300 concentration camps. There, Nazis etched tattoos on prisoners’ arms with numbers corresponding to their punch card numbers.50 Other U.S. major banks and corporations also aided Nazi Germany. Chase Bank helped the Nazis exchange the money stolen from Jewish bank accounts. General Motors supplied Hitler with tens of thousands of inexpensive military Blitz trucks and worked with Rockefeller’s Standard Oil and I.G. Farben to build advanced ethyl plants for the Nazis.51 Throughout WWI and WWII, the Russell Opium Trust-funded Skull and Bones folks were omnipresent in power positions. They included Skull and Bonesman Henry Stimson, who served as President W.H. Taft’s Secretary of War, President Hoover’s Secretary of State, and President Franklin Roosevelt’s Secretary of War.

Roosevelt selected the aging Stimson to appease the Republicans by making his cabinet more bipartisan after entering WWII.52 Henry Stimson took direct control of the atomic bomb development, overseeing the Manhattan Project.53 He pushed President Harry Truman to drop the atomic bomb on the Japanese twice in several days, against the wishes of most military commanders who said it was by no means necessary.54 Such actions appeared indicative of the continued Eugenics extermination philosophy.55 Within the WWII intelligence group, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), were members of America’s wealthiest families, including J.P. Morgan’s sons, the Mellons, Vanderbilts and Duponts.56 Later, other key Skull and Bones members gained important positions in U.S. intelligence including Prescott Bush, father of President George H.W. Bush. These families played the major role in helping pass the legislation titled the National Security Act of 1947. This act founded the Central Intelligence Agency and gave the CIA preeminence among the other fourteen-plus intelligence agencies developed thereafter.57 The highest-ranking CIA whistleblower, former Assistant Deputy Director Victor Marchetti, was a 14-year CIA veteran. Marchetti joined British magazine editor Frances Saunders in finding that virtually the entire CIA leadership and middle ranks were filled with members of the white, Protestant, wealthiest families, with the most connections coming from the Rockefeller family and Foundation. It remained that way into the 1970s with few exceptions. Brothers Allen and John Foster Dulles were close friends with the Rockefellers. John headed the Rockefeller Foundation before becoming President Dwight Eisenhower’s Secretary of State (1953- 61). Allen would become the longest serving CIA Director (1953-61).58 Nearly one quarter of a million federal documents released in the post-WWII time period exposed the facts that the CIA, along with MI6, its British equivalent, hired Nazi war spies and other war criminals following the war. These included five key associates of infamous Nazi leader, Adolph Eichmann, and top Nazi spy, Renald Gehlen. The CIA helped Gehlen and his advisors retain their leadership in West Germany’s intelligence network. A New York Times article revealed that the CIA gave at least two of these Nazis citizenship. Many Nazi war criminals were charged with mass murders. Yet MI6 also hired many Nazi agents, including one responsible for killing close to 100 British agents.59 Researchers in the 1980s revealed other extensive aspects of CIA/Nazi work.

Yet MI6 also hired many Nazi agents, including one responsible for killing close to 100 British agents.59 Researchers in the 1980s revealed other extensive aspects of CIA/Nazi work. Award-winning investigative reporter Christopher Simpson’s 1988 book, Blowback: America’s Recruitment of Nazis, listed hundreds of government archival files and thousands of documents, among its copious citations, describing a half-dozen U.S. intelligence operations protecting and employing Nazis. One, code-named “Sunrise,” was comprised of former Nazi spies. Another, of Nazi scientists, was code-named “Paperclip.” Simpson named Robert Lovett, Allen Dulles and OSS agent Frank Wisner as U.S. intelligence leaders who pushed the hiring of Nazis to do CIA work in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Simpson summarized, “hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of such recruits were SS [Nazi elite guard] veterans.”60 A whistleblowing former chief prosecutor of the Justice Department’s Nazi War Crimes Unit, John Loftus, reported that under Operation Sunrise, CIA director Allen Dulles helped smuggle some 5,000 Nazi Gestapo and SS agents to South America for U.S. intelligence work.61 As detailed later, these Nazis would help the CIA create vast drug trafficking networks in Central and South America. U.S. intelligence abided by the famous dictum of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, who said the aim was not about controlling people Frances Saunders reviewed troves of buried archival U.S. intelligence documents that explained their goals. In a 1950 “NSC Directive,” the U.S. intelligence umbrella group, the National Security Council, described it as psychological warfare … [through] propaganda … to influence [people’s] thoughts and actions … [so that] the subject moves in the direction [controllers] desire for reasons which he believes to be his own.62 Frank Wisner, at the Office of Policy Coordination, oversaw 302 people on their payroll. The Office conducted psychological warfare operations through its “Propaganda Assets Inventory.” Wisner boasted he could, “play the media like a mighty Wurlitzer [music organ].” Wisner supervised an increasing staff that rose to 2,812 locally in 1952, along with 3,142 overseas contract personnel. The budget also rose in that period from $4.7 million to $82 million.63 While it is unknown exactly what Frank Wisner’s employees were doing, various investigators shed some light on their work. Watergate muckraking reporter Carl Bernstein wrote a seminal 1977 exposé on the media. Despite his earlier ’70s Watergate fame, only Rolling Stone magazine published this revealing article. Bernstein wrote that a Senate Intelligence Committee forced CIA Director George H.W. Bush, to admit, “more than 400 journalists had lived double lives, maintaining covert relationships with the CIA.” Others in the CIA told Bernstein the number was far higher. Bernstein listed the Senate Committee findings that owners of virtually all of the leading media companies worked with the CIA. They also had top executives, editors and journalists on the CIA payroll willing to reprint CIA-written articles verbatim under their names.64 The Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan interests had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:11:3bae62ec781d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3296, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "CIA Director George H.W.

Bernstein listed the Senate Committee findings that owners of virtually all of the leading media companies worked with the CIA. They also had top executives, editors and journalists on the CIA payroll willing to reprint CIA-written articles verbatim under their names.64 The Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan interests had already bought control of the most influential newspapers and investigative magazines. Ben Bagdikian, Dean of the University of California/Berkeley Journalism School, set forth the ways in which multinational corporate owners continued to gain even tighter controls over public information in his book The Media Monopoly, describing how the ever-consolidating world of media ownership approached near-monopolization by a few companies.66 He explained that most major media outlets have directors on their company boards who also sit on the boards of major multinational corporations. For example, the Board of Directors of Time magazine and the industry standard-bearer New York Times also sit on corporate boards involved in defense contracting, oil, and pharmaceuticals, as well as banks, finance and insurance companies. Under law, “The director of a company is obliged to act in the interests of his or her own company.”67 Thus, the directors of media further the interests of the interlocked multinational companies. In the 1970s and 1980s, to further tighten the elite’s control of public information, U.S. intelligence gained direct ownership over the vast majority of magazine and journal information sources. One of their own publications, Armed Forces Journal International, revealed that the Pentagon (military intelligence) published 371 magazines in 1971, making it sixteen times larger than the nation’s next biggest publisher. This number increased to 1,203 different periodicals by 1982.68 These 1200 magazine and journal titles straddled many areas of life, controlling information that could make it to the pages of news, fashion and sports magazines crowding book chain outlets. In 1975, a Senate intelligence committee issued a report revealing the taxpayer-funded CIA owned outright “more than 200 wire services, newspapers, magazines, and book publishing complexes,” according to Professor Michael Parenti in his book, Inventing Reality, and Washington Post reporter Morton Mintz in his book, Power, Inc. Mintz quoted a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities 1976 report that showed how the CIA promoted its own propaganda. It said a book written “by one CIA operative was reviewed favorably by another CIA agent in the New York Times.”69 Dan Rather, one of the best-known media insiders, described the media’s conservative censorship in stark terms. Rather’s career included reporting for United Press International, working as the CBS Southern Bureau chief and then a position as anchorman on the CBS Evening News in 1981. He remained in that position until 2005.

He remained in that position until 2005. In 2002, the British Broadcasting Corporation interviewed Rather about the media’s aid in the suppression of dissent in the United States. Rather said, “What you have here is a miniature version of what you have in totalitarian states.”70 As detailed later, this kind of control over people’s access to information would allow American rulers to manipulatively promote certain dangerous drugs. It would further hide the use of Nazis in various U.S. intelligencerelated operations. And, it would influence people to fight wars to control other countries’ drug crops, while leading people to believe they were fighting for freedom and democracy.

General Motors “humanitarian” efforts continued long after the war. GM led a criminal conspiracy to monopolize and undermine mass transit in dozens of American cities; sixteen months after the end of World War II, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover got a memo outlining GM’s work to develop shadow company National City Lines in 1937. As suggested by a theme in the 1980s movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit, General Motors helped create the front company National City Lines, with five uneducated bus drivers, the Fitzgerald brothers, owning it. General Motors led Mack Truck, Phillips Petroleum, Standard Oil of California and Firestone Tires in operating behind the scenes as major preferred stockholders of National City Lines. The company bought trolley car systems in more than sixteen states and pulled the tracks from the streets. They then trashed or burned the cars and replaced them with more expensive and environmentally-hazardous motor buses. 54 Alexandra Robbins, Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power (Boston: Little, Brown, 2002).

This film won the Grand Jury Prize for documentary at the Sundance Film Festival. Rather’s quote was reprinted at www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2002/cyb20020517_extra.asp. Project MK-Ultra was the CIA’s umbrella name for at least several projects that used psychedelic drugs against the enemies of the American ruling oligarchy. This was revealed by Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain, who interviewed hundreds of people and read thousands of declassified government documents, books and articles for their book Acid Dreams, The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties and Beyond. Although CIA Director Richard Helms destroyed all of the CIA’s MK-Ultra files in 1973, he missed the financial department’s files. It is those files and other source material that provided Lee, Shlain and other researchers with information on the project.2 One such researcher, Professor Alfred McCoy, the author of The Politics of Heroin, later wrote about the CIA projects that led up to MK-Ultra. In his book, A Question of Torture, McCoy wrote that Dr. Kurt Plotner and other Nazi scientists tested mescaline on concentration camp prisoners during World War II. The New York Times wrote that the U.S. Justice Department printed a 600-page secret report in 2006 about the U.S. government’s operations saving Plotner and thousands of other Nazis. Writers such as retired Air Force colonel Walter Boyne, a former director of Washington’s Air and Space Museum, wrote an Air Force Magazine article about “Project Paperclip” (better known as Operation Paperclip) that saved at least 700 Nazi scientists. The Joint Chiefs of Staff started these operations in 1945, and the CIA continued them, saving what was originally estimated as “10,000 Nazis” from various professions, though the Justice Department report found a somewhat lower number of Nazis saved. The operations gave these Nazis employment with the U.S. government, ostensibly to fight Communism during the Cold War.3 Hank Albarelli Jr., a veteran journalist who also had served in President Jimmy Carter’s administration, wrote several articles as well as a book about Operation Paperclip and MK-Ultra, exposing the fact that the Operation transferred over 1,600 Nazi scientists to the U.S. to work in the former eugenics office, known as Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, as well as in the Brookhaven nuclear laboratory and on Plum Island, the site of biological weapons experiments.

Nazi scientists brought with them their research on psychedelics into offices shared with CIA scientists. They also regularly met with Swiss Sandoz scientist Albert Hoffman.4 The many inhumane exploits of these Nazi scientists who later worked in MK-Ultra programs are well known. CIA-employed Nazi scientist Herbert Gerstner had programmatically killed German children.5 America’s “father of space medicine,” Hubertus Strughold, tested psychedelics on concentration camp victims at Dachau, and he conducted experiments that involved shooting victims, injecting them with gasoline, crushing them to death, and freezing them to death in ice water.6 In 1938, Albert Hoffman created Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) while working for a Swiss company, Sandoz, a subsidiary of the Nazi I.G. Farben cartel. The Swiss pharmaceutical industry had previously handled much of the European opium traffic. Sandoz then supplied LSD to Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele who first experimented with it on concentration camp victims.7 In 1943, Albert Hoffman tried his first experiment with LSD on unwitting patients at a Swiss hospital; he then experimented on university students and laboratory workers. At least one of them committed suicide by jumping from a high window. A later Independent Commission of Experts in Switzerland found that Sandoz, as well as the Swiss pharmaceutical company Ciba, acted in collaboration with I.G. Farben in Nazi atrocities. During WWII, Farben fired all the Jews employed in its companies and replaced them with Nazi supporters. They also collaborated on the manufacturing of Zyklon B and other lethal gasses used in concentration camps.8 Gordon Wasson, who had been working as a vice-president of J.P. Morgan and Company, reported that he and several scientists began working for the CIA several years after it had formed.9 Wasson traveled the world with CIA scientists in search of poisonous and psychedelic mushrooms that they gathered and sent to Albert Hoffman at Sandoz.10 In the late 1950s, Wasson published an article in Life magazine promoting psychedelic mushrooms.11 The U.S. Army made former Nazi Friedrich Hoffman (no relation to Albert) the “Chief of Agents” (drugs) at Maryland’s Edgewood Chemical Arsenal, where seven other former Nazi scientists also worked. Hoffman, Dr. Savage and fellow scientists gave LSD to unknowing soldiers at Edgewood in the 1950s. They then coupled the LSD with other techniques in a project called Artichoke. Their experiments included keeping prisoners, who were drug-treatment patients in Lexington, Kentucky, tripping for 77 days straight.12 The U.S. Army also worked with the CIA in running similar experiments in their Chemical", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:24:3c1573a4e426", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3309, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "Albert) the “Chief of Agents” (drugs) at Maryland’s Edgewood Chemical Arsenal, where seven other former Nazi scientists also worked.

Their experiments included keeping prisoners, who were drug-treatment patients in Lexington, Kentucky, tripping for 77 days straight.12 The U.S. Army also worked with the CIA in running similar experiments in their Chemical Warfare Laboratories, sharing their research with British and Canadian scientists. The CIA claimed they researched LSD because of an unverified report that the Soviet Union had bought up the world supply.13 However, only three months before, CIA Director Helms had said the Soviets were five years behind the U.S. in LSD research.14 Similarly, a group of conservative politicians formed the Committee on the Present Danger and propagandized the myth of Soviet technical superiority in nuclear weapons. They warned of imminent danger from a Soviet Union nuclear attack. In reality, the Soviet Union developed nuclear arms years after the U.S. The Soviet arsenal never came close in size to America’s. The CIA also falsely claimed the Russians might put LSD in the U.S. water supply. In fact, it was the CIA that researched and successfully found a way to make LSD work in a water supply.15 Within several years, the CIA combined many of its mind-altering drug Richard Helms was an assistant deputy, in charge of covert operations, and supervised Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who ran the program. Gottlieb had worked on other projects that obtained substances from the U.S. Army Special Operations, and he continued to direct the testing of LSD and other substances as potential incapacitants, and for the purpose of assassination. Two other areas of MK-Ultra focus included cancer-causing compounds and radiation warfare, the latter of which was almost completely blacked out of CIA documents.16 The CIA put LSD in the drinks of thousands of unsuspecting people from the 1950s onwards. Jonathan Marks, Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the U.S. State Department, described how the CIA started dosing individuals in 1952.17 The CIA leaders came from some of the wealthiest families, and they considered leftists their political opponents. The CIA eventually would develop a hit list of leftist leaders to dose, damage and discredit (presumably with an extremely large amount of LSD at one time). Marks stated that the involuntary dosing with LSD caused one Argentine leftist professor, an early victim, to act in highly irrational ways that discredited him for several years.18 As will be discussed in more detail, one of the largest populations of saved Nazis was in Argentina.

Pierce’s Math Department chair fired two members of his department for alleged activities in “controversial” political groups. Pierce said he was considered a “left-winger,” due “partly to my membership in peace groups and opposition to the Cold War, but it was primarily my criticism of FBI investigations.” The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Professor Pierce. Pierce moved to Oklahoma State University, where he published a letter criticizing unreasonable psychiatric hospitalizations. A few days later, a police officer and sheriff ’s deputy arrested Pierce for false reasons, involuntarily committed Pierce, and placed him under the care of influential By 1953 the CIA had ordered 10 kilos of LSD from Sandoz for $240, 000 . Having already tested LSD many times since 1949, the CIA knew this supply offered one hundred million doses. The CIA asked the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company to try to synthesize LSD. By mid-1954, Eli Lilly broke Sandoz’s formula and assured the CIA that in a matter of months LSD would be available in tonnage quantities.20 U.S. intelligence superspy Captain Alfred Hubbard served with the CIA-forerunner Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Hubbard worked with British psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond in experiments with LSD and mescaline on patients in Canada, even though Hubbard had no medical or scientific credentials.21 By 1953, psychiatrists had begun using LSD across North America, utilizing low doses on patients in special mental health treatment centers. Soon, similar LSD centers sprung up in Germany, Holland, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia and some Scandinavian countries.22 Dr. Osmond used large doses of LSD on patients at Weyburn Hospital in Canada, reportedly to cure their alcoholism. Hubbard opened three treatment centers in Canada for the same purpose. The centers claimed a 50% success rate and began using “high dose” treatment with LSD in the U.S. Whether their 50% success rate was true or not (later medical reviews said it wasn’t), Hubbard and Osmond had other plans with LSD, or “acid.” They said they wanted to transform the belief systems of world leaders to “further the cause of world peace.” Their actual goal appeared the same as their U.S. intelligence employer’s—to damage leftist leaders’ minds and increase American rulers’ global dominance.23 Dr. Humphrey Osmond coined the term “psychedelic,” meaning “mindmanifesting.” Osmond’s work to popularize acid led him to enlist Brave New World author Aldous Huxley as a proponent of psychedelics.

Brave New World, published in 1932, was listed by many literary organizations as one of the most important novels of the century. Osmond first gave mescaline to Huxley in May of 1953. Huxley wrote about the experience in The Doors of Perception. Osmond continued his LSD experiments at Princeton University.24 While Huxley worked on another book, Hubbard supplied him with his second mescaline trip, before introducing LSD later in the year. Captain Hubbard impressed Huxley with his connections to the top echelons of American business and government, which Huxley believed was due partly to Hubbard’s fortune made as a uranium entrepreneur.25 Huxley promoted psychedelics in his last books, despite the themes of Brave New World, which warned of rulers keeping people content with their lot through the use of escapist drugs. n the early 1950s, a push began for mental hygiene departments that were I closely intertwined with eugenics. William Welch, a founding leader of the Committee of Mental Hygiene, was also chairman of the Eugenics Record Office board of scientific directors, and scientific director for top eugenics funder John D. Rockefeller.26 This movement enabled Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to run MK-Ultra psychedelics experiments through contracts with many institutions. It began with jails, but soon included drug treatment agencies and mental institutions. The directors of the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institutes of Health used their agencies to help channel funds to these institutions for the known purpose of testing drugs on subjects. By 1953, in what appeared to be purposeful targeting, MK-Ultra doctors started damaging more prominent people with their MK-Ultra drugs. After a divorce in that year, Harold Blauer, a once-highly-seeded, 42 year-old, Jewish professional tennis player, went inpatient for depression. Despite progress he made in talk therapy, doctors at the Rockefeller-funded New York State Psychiatric Institute ordered MDA for him as part of a military experiment on him without his knowledge. MDA (code name EA 1298) is an ecstasy pre-curser drug, and the Army Chemical Corps, stationed at Maryland’s Edgewood Arsenal, supplied it. Dr. Paul Hoch, a member of the still-extant Eugenics Society, and Blauer’s hospital physician, ordered the drug, well aware it would damage Blauer, as Hoch had previously published a paper on that very subject. When Blauer had a bad reaction and attempted to refuse a fourth injection of the drugs, Dr. Hoch ignored him. A fifth injection of the drugs killed Blauer.27 It should be remembered that eugenics deemed 70% of Jews deserving death.28 Dr. Hoch worked for the Army and as a CIA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:27:48f30b69ba2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3312, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "member of the still-extant Eugenics Society, and Blauer’s hospital physician, ordered the drug, well aware it would damage Blauer, as Hoch had previously published a paper on that very subject.

A fifth injection of the drugs killed Blauer.27 It should be remembered that eugenics deemed 70% of Jews deserving death.28 Dr. Hoch worked for the Army and as a CIA consultant. He gave LSD to psychiatric patients and then lobotomized them to compare the effects of acid before and after the surgery. In one experiment a patient was given a local anesthetic and told to describe what he saw as the doctor removed chunks of his cerebral cortex. Hoch is quoted as saying, “It is possible that a certain amount of brain damage is of therapeutic value.” In 1955 Hoch became New York State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene.29 Two years earlier, in 1953, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb used LSD as a weapon on an important CIA scientist named Frank Olson. Olson headed key biological warfare experiments at Camp Detrick (now Fort Detrick) in Maryland. U.S. intelligence considered Olson a serious security risk after he began telling people close to him that he wanted to leave the CIA. Olson had helped guide Air Force testing of anthrax-like spores on people in Antigua and Alaska. Less dangerous spores were tested in San Francisco and many other cities. The family of one man claimed these spores caused their father’s death in a case that was taken to the Supreme Court.30 U.S. intelligence first interrogated Olson in 1949, but had darker plans for him by 1953. Those closest to Olson reported he became very disturbed about the Air Force’s use of biological weapons he had worked upon in the Korean War from 1950-53.31 Olson also voiced strong misgivings about taking part in some of the early MK-Ultra experiments in Germany where he had joined other CIA and Nazi scientists, including concentration camp experimenters, in interrogating agents from the Soviet Union and East Germany. These interrogations involved the use of LSD and other drugs. They also involved fatal torture. Olson’s close friend and former military scientist colleague, Norman Courneyer, said Olson returned from that trip to Germany very distraught. In a documentary film, Code Name Artichoke, Courneyer relates that, in 1953, Olson told him that witnessing people tortured to death led him to prepare to resign from his CIA post.32 Hank Albarelli wrote an 800-page book on Frank Olson’s murder at the hands of the CIA. Alabarelli conducted hundreds of personal interviews and sifted through decades of government documents.

Alabarelli conducted hundreds of personal interviews and sifted through decades of government documents. Albarelli’s book, A Terrible Mistake, presented overwhelming evidence that the highest levels of the CIA wanted to silence Olson. They not only wanted to stop him from speaking out on the operations cited above but also, and more particularly, for his exposing of Project SPAN, an operation involved in the 1951 aerosol spraying of LSD on the town of Pont-St. Esprit, France, which resulted in several deaths and many injuries.33 Two CIA sources, among others, confirmed to Albarelli that MK-Ultra Director Sidney Gottlieb targeted Frank Olson with LSD and another interrogation drug at a retreat near Camp Detrick on November 19, 1953. After the interrogation, Olson remained highly confused and disturbed.34 The CIA then sent Olson to New York to see a Columbia University professor, Harold Abramson, MD. Abramson was also a major in the Army, working as a part-time consultant for the Army Chemical Corps as part of Operation Artichoke, which officially became part of MK-Ultra in April of 1953.35 On November 28, nine days after his interrogation, Frank Olson fell from a 10th floor room of the Statler Hotel in New York. A CIA agent was found in his room moments later. Albarelli’s book and the film Code Name Artichoke present overwhelming evidence that CIA agents threw Olson out of that window. According to notable forensic doctors, Olson suffered blunt trauma to the head that killed him before he was thrown from the window. Also of interest, Francois Spirito and longtime CIA spy Pierre Lafitte were the last people with Olson just before his death. MK-Ultra Deputy Director Robert Lashbrook left Olson with Spirito and Lafitte at the end of the night. They escorted Olson up to his room, shortly before Olson came falling out the tenth floor window. Award-winning journalist Sally Denton and former National Security Council staff member Roger Morris found that Pierre Lafitte also played a major role in the opium-trafficking network that included Meyer Lansky and in which the CIA “ultimately colluded.”36 During his time off from Columbia University, Dr. Abramson ran MK-Ultra experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island in New York.37 Did research at this location, formerly the official eugenics headquarters, continue where it had left off, using more sophisticated tactics in the targeting of groups the oligarchs and CIA considered undesirable? According to Hank Albarelli: “Abramson, throughout the 1950s, was well known in select circles for staging almost weekly LSD sorties at his Long Island estate. The gatherings were said to be so popular that guests had to be turned away.”38 MK-Ultra agents appeared to duplicate Abramson’s model in the 1960s.

Dr. Ewen Cameron, an important Canadian academic working with LSD, had headed the Canadian, American, and the World University, Cameron administered LSD in frequent doses and delivered massive electroshock treatment in conjunction with repeatedly playing tape-recorded messages to “depattern” and then recondition people he diagnosed with schizophrenia. Cameron also injected LSD into patients with depression and put them through electroshock treatment, many times at far higher doses than was standard.39 Dr. Cameron’s methods were later discredited, and nine of his subjects sued the American government for a million dollars each when it was learned that Cameron had been working with the CIA’s MK-Ultra program. Plaintiffs said they never agreed to participate in Cameron’s scientific experiments and still suffered from the trauma up into the 1990s.40 The CIA settled out of court for substantial amounts of money. One of Cameron’s victims was the wife of a prominent Jewish leftist politician, David Orlikow. After Orlikow’s wife, Val, gave birth to their daughter, she suffered from postpartum depression. The Winnipeg Free Press described what happened next. “She was sent to Montreal for several treatment stints, totaling three years, under the care of psychiatrist Ewen Cameron. She was made an unwitting guinea pig in secret brainwashing experiments financed by the CIA that used frequent shock treatments at far stronger than standard levels. She was the subject of 14 experiments with LSD … the damage to her mind was permanent.”41 Dr. Cameron had also been a member of the Nuremberg Tribunal (1945- 1948) that passed judgment on Nazi war criminals. To many, the Nuremberg “trials” appeared a sham, at least in part. For example, Mary M. Kaufman prosecuted the case against I.G. Farben, which ran murderous experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kaufman said, “We were hampered by the [U.S.] State Department throughout.” She also said she was shocked to find one I.G. Farben defendant out of jail. The defendant told her: “The judge let me out so I could go over some evidence.” She said, “What he had done, in fact, was to go with an assistant to the place where the I.G. Farben files were kept and indicate which files should be destroyed. Which was promptly done! The judges … were motivated by a tremendous anti-Semitism … [and] getting their hands on German real estate.”42 The Nuremberg Tribunal heard the cases against Nazi war criminals and set the International Code of Ethics, including an international ban", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:30:c914f662c3f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3315, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "I could go over some evidence.” She said, “What he had done, in fact, was to go with an assistant to the place where the I.G.

Yet, the U.S. subsequently allowed the CIA and other intelligence agencies to act outside of the Code. Many Nuremberg defendants got off easy or completely, despite what Kaufman described as a mass of evidence against them. I.G. Farben’s Director, Otto Ambrose, received an eight-year sentence. U.S. intelligence, under Operation Paperclip, commuted it to three. Upon release, Ambrose was hired by major American chemical company W.R. Grace.43 At locations such as Edgewood Arsenal and U.S. Air Force bases, American and ex- Nazi MK-Ultra scientists gave LSD to more than one thousand soldiers. At Edgewood, records of these soldiers were tracked from 1955-75. Early on, the records made it clear to MK-Ultra officials that LSD caused lasting damage in their research subjects.44 An officer reported volunteering for an experiment with a substance he was told was akin to alcohol. After receiving two LSD doses, he ended up feeling permanently damaged. Over the next eleven years he suffered extreme anxiety, depression and violent behavior. He retired early from the Air Force in 1968.45 AgentsUsedinthe,Edyruood/AberdeenExpsmmeits, TabeLCoPeticalAgontsCieAnlondSirCo W N HrenrClaas Aeh Ansler MleL) B(BmsMde An et) 12 Pwni A D sogk(De) Mei A Aet rge(P06) tdeAe cgke (rbw) 5y Aee t (eelii Ainbr ssivd emilide atiz(PTJ8.at Thnie APOK muiitx Beoir Maoke r 4isns aus lui ho Cl e Ou snu(PDK) ( Cefirpe (PDR) Soaylles Golinie [PURi Dds Choliwyir (PDR MO 15m smeeRnctiote Anu C Fkormoi Dye doeeh ocLim De Sd Se S o Shi Alcoe d) dire Andhal Ab Sodedrv Cll Hytet Salalee Meo Sodar(roR) Nest Sattive(FORs rtital e Sedesies Solmid Salative(FOR) Caffeoe Doedre a(PDE) Rini mt(POB3 MAedspebd nm NNh V De Under the auspices of MK-Ultra and linked government programs, the military used soldiers at Edgewood Arsenal as guinea pigs in testing dozens of drugs for unconventional warfare. Another soldier, a U.S. Army sergeant, “suffered hallucinations, memory loss, incoherence, and severe personality changes as well as uncontrollable violence. These effects destroyed his family and impeded his working ability. He never knew why until the Army asked him to participate in a follow-up study.” After suing for compensation, he lost a Supreme Court decision. But in 1991, his Congressman sponsored a bill that helped him receive $400, 000 compensation from the government for the damage LSD had done to him.46 Research by two physicians in 1970 determined LSD use didn’t necessarily cause “an acute psychotic reaction” in people without “marked schizoid or sociopathic", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:31:691c16e543c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3316, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "family and impeded his working ability.

The study’s authors found that LSD led to prolonged psychoses in a quarter of their subjects; in another quarter, it caused a decrease in the ability to cope with anxiety, even weeks after use. The authors concluded that, “this was most notable in periods of stress, when it was necessary to mobilize resources to counter anxiety. Instead of functioning effectively, they experienced depersonalization and a return to visual hallucinations, and were much more incapacitated than they had been before the LSD experience.”48 One man whose LSD use initiated long-term psychosis was Mark Vonnegut, the son of best-selling novelist Kurt Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse Five). Mark Vonnegut reported previously “tripping” on LSD four times without any problems, but the fifth time led to immediate and lasting psychosis. Vonnegut ended up in a mental institution for a year. He wrote about this harrowing time of his life in a memoir, Eden Express. 49 An overview of 46 existing studies, published in 1968, reported many harmful reactions lasting beyond the intoxication stage of acid. These included “paranoia … megalomaniacal delusions … prolonged or intermittent LSD-like psychosis.” LSD use also resulted in “psychotic depressions usually associated with agitation and anxiety.” The studies further found that longer-term LSD use often led to “chronic anxiety reactions associated with depression, somatic symptoms, difficulty in functioning and a recurrence of LSD-like symptoms,” along with “acute panic states.”50 A 1966 study by Max Rinkel stated, “Dangers are many times multiplied by their illegitimate use. People who have taken LSD obtained on the black market can become psychotic often weeks or months after the ingestion of LSD. They are being admitted to the hospital in ever-increasing numbers.” While this quote may be an overstatement of the problem, Rinkel died of a heart attack shortly after publication of this study, and Sandoz laboratory discontinued their provision of LSD to researchers.51 The American Psychiatric Association produced a position statement on LSD at a meeting in June of 1966. After ten years of use in their therapy sessions with patients, they cautiously admitted the dangers of LSD use, stating, “The indiscriminate consumption of this hazardous drug can and not", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:32:0a744bb58b5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3317, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "numbers.” While this quote may be an overstatement of the problem, Rinkel died of a heart attack shortly after publication of this study, and Sandoz laboratory discontinued their provision of LSD to researchers.51 The American Psychiatric Association produced a position statement on LSD at a meeting in June of 1966. After ten years of use in their therapy sessions with patients, they cautiously admitted the dangers of LSD use, stating, “The indiscriminate consumption of this hazardous drug can and not infrequently does lead to destructive physiological and personality changes.” Cornell University Professor Donald Louria stated that LSD “must be listed as one of the most dangerous drugs in the pharmacopeia of man … well-adjusted persons can be thrown into acute psychosis requiring days or weeks of hospitalization. This is true even in the hands of an experienced physician who carefully selects his patients.”52 Researcher Conrad Schwarz reviewed 46 studies of LSD in a presentation to the North Pacific Society of Psychiatry. One of the five discussion points of this meta-study remains key. The author commented on the findings of LSD users’ “personality deterioration toward a nonactivist role in society.” Conservative think-tank leaders later commented on their success at spreading the use of LSD to cultivate a “dropped out” society of young Americans.53 Schwarz’s meta-study further brought up the danger of contaminants and impurities in LSD. One common additive to LSD is strychnine, an animal poison that can cause some mild brain damage. While some say this is an urban myth, respected researchers Lee and Shlain report strychnine as a common additive in the 1960s, and forensic textbooks report it remains an LSD contaminant today.54 At least four studies, conducted between 1966 and 1976, support evidence of LSD, street-bought or not, causing possible brain damage. A 1969 study by William McGlothlin et al. found “evidence of moderate impairment of abstract abilities … suggestive of minimal brain damage,” though the experimental design could not determine whether it was definitively causal. A 1972 study by I.D. Accord noted that the subjects who had previously taken LSD showed “some mild, but measurable cerebral dysfunction regarding abstract abilities.” A 1973 study by Accord and Barker began “to indicate that there may be a causal relationship between the use of hallucinogens and brain damage.” And a study that Margarete DiBenedetto conducted in 1976 on the brains of subjects who had discontinued LSD use three to twelve months prior to testing also suggested some possible cerebral damage.55 1 See pdf of paper, “Chemical Warfare Agent Experiments Among U.S. Service Members,” https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did ⌊= 466161, including: US Army Medical Department, US Army Health Services Command, Project Director LTC David A.

After World War II, a civil war broke out in China, and in 1949 the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, led by Communist Mao Zedong (also written Mao Tse-tung), overthrew the old, U.S.-backed colonialist government. Mao introduced food crops to replace the poppy fields and led a massive detoxification campaign that eliminated demand in the world’s largest addict population. Those who refused to give up their addiction were sent to labor camps.1 The Kuomintang (Nationalist) leader at the time of Mao’s revolution, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island of Taiwan while Nationalist Chinese generals and many thousands of troops also retreated to Burma, adjoining China’s southern border. In the following years, the Burmese Army drove some of these troops into Laos. In both Burma and Laos, these generals cultivated vast new poppy fields similar to the ones they had presided over in China. From 1950 onwards, the U.S. military and intelligence also aided Chiang and his generals’ attempts to regain control of China.2 By 1950, weapons manufacturing companies in the U.S. gathered politicians to form the Committee on the Present Danger. Under the leadership of Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson, they influenced President Truman to pass National Security Council Directive 68 that called for military containment of the Soviet Union. The National Broadcasting Corporation aired a weekly television program to promote it. This initiated the anti-Communist Red Scare, or Cold War, that lasted for over three decades.3 The fight against the “Red Menace” was first played out in Korea, a country bordering Communist China’s northeast. By the end of World War II, the Japanese had controlled Korea for over fifty years. After WWII, Korea was divided in half, with the Soviet Union occupying North Korea and the U.S. occupying South Korea. Around 1950, border skirmishes between the two territories ended up with American soldiers fighting for South Korea and Red Chinese soldiers sent in to defend North Korea.

Once installed, the peasant soldiers began cultivating the crop they new best, the opium poppy. When China entered the Korean War, the CIA had a desperate need for intelligence on that nation. The agency turned to the warlord generals, who agreed to slip some soldiers back into China. In return, the agency offered arms. Officially, the arms were intended to equip the warlords for a return to China. In fact, the Chinese wanted them to repel any attack by the Burmese.7 In brief, the U.S. followed a CIA directive to arm these longtime opiumtrafficking generals partly for a counter-revolution in China. Professor Alfred McCoy backed Collins’s assertion that the CIA also helped arm the Chinese Nationalist generals in Burma to protect their opium crops from attacks by the Burmese Army. The CIA supported the Nationalist Chinese while they became the opium barons of the Golden Triangle area of Burma, Thailand and Laos. According to McCoy: “CIA activities in Burma helped transform [its] Shan states … into the largest opium growing region in the world.”8 In late 1952, towards the end of the Korean War, the Nationalist Chinese generals once loyal to Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. led thousands of Nationalist Chinese mercenaries to help them expand their territory in Burma. The Burmese Army pushed back and found American consultants’ dead bodies on the battlefield. In March of 1953, four months before the end of the Korean War, Burma took its case of Nationalist Chinese and American aggression before the U.N. Burma won a resolution for the Nationalist Chinese generals and soldiers to be deported to Taiwan. Professor McCoy detailed how the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, a senior advisor to the CIA, helped orchestrate a fake exodus of Nationalist generals and soldiers (impersonated by tribal boys) that actually left all the generals and most of the mercenary Nationalist Chinese soldiers where they were: in Burma, protecting their opium fields.9 Many of the wealthiest American families already had a hand in the opium trade. Now family members and employees in leadership conjunction with their opposition to Communist influence in countries worldwide. Professor McCoy, in The Politics of Heroin, points out how, when France was still digging itself out from war in 1947, various factors, including the CIA covertly intervening, helped topple the Communist party from power and brought about a permanent realignment of politicians in Marseille, France.10 Just after World War II, the newly created CIA provided arms, money and other support to help the Corsican Mafia take control of Marseille ports from the labor unions and Communist Party.

The CIA aided the Mafia in drug trafficking too, and soon Marseille was the opium-trafficking capital of the industrialized world. This was spotlighted in a Hollywood movie, The French Connection. Heroin laboratories opened in Marseille in 1951, only months after the Corsicans gained control over the waterfront.11 The French had fights over opium trafficking both locally and abroad. The future North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, was educated in France, before helping found the French Communist Party. In Marseilles, dock workers fought for higher pay and better working conditions, striking in 1947 and 1950. A CIA agent was quoted as saying he supplied a leader of the American Federation of Labor with up to $2 million to pay off Corsicans to break strikes and bring in replacement workers from Italy. Corsican gangsters threw any Communist leaders who opposed them into the harbor.12 In South Vietnam, the French and U.S. gave money and arms to local leaders in a war with each other for control of the country. French intelligence, the Deuxieme Bureau, spent a great deal of money strengthening their already existing groups, such as the Binh Xuyen. The CIA gave millions of dollars to Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem and his Vietnamese army.13 UC-Berkeley Professor Peter Dale Scott documented the importance of drugs in America’s Vietnam War. In Drugs, Oil and War he wrote, “In 1959 … the local drug trade was threatened by political developments,” which pulled the U.S. into its first U.S. Marine presence in Vietnam within a year. Scott’s research also found the CIA supporting the Kuomentang Nationalist Chinese Party in their goal of reconquering China, and in their drug trade with corrupt officials in Thailand and Hong Kong.1 Professor McCoy detailed how in 1959, “Field Marshal Sarit [Thanarat of Thailand] unleashed a full military assault on the opium trade.” Troops “swept the country, raiding the opium dens, seizing their stocks, and confiscating opium pipes.” Sarit then made a declaration of drug eradication to the Thai people.15 Two weeks later, seemingly on behalf of the American oligarchy’s drug traffickers, the CIA raised this as a crisis in neighboring Laos, saying it required increasing American military intervention over the next decade (and triggering the war in neighboring Vietnam). Agent John Stockwell, like other whistleblowers, took part in the drug trafficking for his employer throughout that area and Indochina before he quit the CIA.16 The opium traffickers who comprised part of America’s wealthiest ruling oligarchy had good", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:42:49b67cc8ad8b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3327, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "Thai people.15 Two weeks later, seemingly on behalf of the American oligarchy’s drug traffickers, the CIA raised this as a crisis in neighboring Laos, saying it required increasing American military intervention over the next decade (and triggering the war in neighboring Vietnam). Agent John Stockwell, like other whistleblowers, took part in the drug trafficking for his employer throughout that area and Indochina before he quit the CIA.16 The opium traffickers who comprised part of America’s wealthiest ruling oligarchy had good reason to covet the poppy fields of the region around Vietnam. Along with its potential for cash, they wanted the opium to help suppress leftist liberation movements at home and abroad. So, in tandem with using the money garnered from opium sales to buy support against the Communist North Vietnamese, they flooded American inner cities with heroin. They appeared to do this to repress antiwar activists and people of color struggling for equal rights. In his landmark book The Politics of Heroin, Professor Alfred McCoy detailed the manner in which American-supported South Vietnamese leaders were able to traffic heroin with U.S. intelligence aid. McCoy also chronicled later how South Vietnamese heroin was directly imported into New York and other cities. Around the time Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Viet Minh were about to win an overwhelming victory in the 1954 Vietnamese elections, the American oligarchs and their political allies countered by supporting a political split in that country. The Communists posed the threat of ridding the country of opium dealings, as Mao Zedong had done after the Communist revolution in China.17 McCoy quoted the infamous “Pentagon Papers” leaked by government official Daniel Ellsburg to the press. The conclusion: South Vietnam “was essentially a creation of the United States,” and, “Without U.S. aid in the following years … South Vietnam … could not have survived.”18 McCoy cited military reports on the development of major heroin trafficking from this U.S. intelligence-created South Vietnamese government. One report from a U.S. Army provost marshal stated that high-ranking members of the South Vietnamese government were “the top ‘zone’ in a four-tiered heroin pushing pyramid.”19 The CIA aided the South Vietnamese government and the neighboring Laotian government in fighting the growing movement of people in both countries struggling for a more egalitarian communist society. The Academy Award-winning documentary Hearts and Minds presented South Vietnamese leaders saying the CIA forced their government to do CIA bidding, such as arranging deliveries from other opium-producing countries like Burma to areas where Laotian and Vietnamese people sided with the Communists against U.S. goals.20 The CIA also trained the Hmong people. From “1960-1974, the CIA maintained a secret mercenary army of 30,000 Hmong tribesmen in the mountains of northern Laos, participants in a covert operation that remains the largest single operation in the agency’s forty-year history,” to fight Communist insurgents throughout Laos.21 The Hmong cultivated opiumproducing poppy fields, the opium", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:43:baedb5d3bd32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3328, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "such as arranging deliveries from other opium-producing countries like Burma to areas where Laotian and Vietnamese people sided with the Communists against U.S. goals.20 The CIA also trained the Hmong people.

In further response, U.S. intelligence repressed the Vietnamese militarily through Operation Phoenix, which assassinated Communist South Vietnamese by the tens of thousands. The CIA expanded its use of heroin to repress activists and potential activists in China and other Asian countries. McCoy wrote, “Still enjoying tacit CIA support for their counterinsurgency work [against the government of Communist China], [ousted] Nationalist Chinese military caravans [in Burma] continued to move almost all of Burma’s opium exports into northern Thailand, where they were purchased by a Chinese [organized crime] syndicate for domestic distribution [inside China] and export to Hong Kong and Malaysia.” These Chinese Nationalist CIA assets were used as part of what news organizations labeled the 1967 Opium War against Communists in Burma, partly to gain further control of their poppy fields.23 During U.S. military missions in Indochina, the CIA set up a vast opium-trafficking system through Laos.24 Within a dozen years, the country would have one of busiest airports in the world despite having a population under three million and its third-world status. With the other two countries around Vietnam, Burma and Thailand, Southeast Asia became the source of about 70% of the of the world’s opium for heroin production by 1970.25 These European countries exported much of Africa’s natural resources of gold, rubber, sugar, diamonds and oil while exploiting African labor. Researcher Thomas Peckenham, in The Scramble for Africa, quoted many verified accounts of European brutality against the Africans. Peckenham said, and other researchers agreed, that blacks in Africa were slaves in every way except by name. European colonizers used decades of starvation, mutilation and mass murder to ensure servitude.26 World War II left European armies depleted, allowing local leaders in Africa to organize independence movements. Libya, under joint control of Italy, Britain and France, gained independence in 1951. Egypt ultimately freed itself from Britain in 1953.

Sudan fought off British control in 1956, and Tunisia gained freedom from French rule in that same year. Morocco gained independence from France and Spain in 1956 as well. The socialists and nationalist groups leading the movements were tired of being exploited by industrialized countries. U.S. intelligence worked in collaboration with British and other European intelligence agencies to stop African independence. These independence movements cost the wealthy corporate owners in their countries hundreds of millions of dollars (billions in present values). Intelligence agencies used guns and drugs against the African independence movements, in both open and surreptitious actions.27 The CIA’s use of drugs for this purpose remains a part of their covert operations, with few details revealed. CIA documents state how the agency used LSD to aid interrogation on an operational basis from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s. As previously mentioned, the CIA also used LSD against foreign leftist leaders. A CIA document noted that the CIA’s administration of LSD “to high officials would be a relatively simple matter and could have significant effect at key meetings, speeches, etc.”28 The agency planned to slip odorless, tasteless LSD, “to socialist or left-leaning politicians in foreign countries so that they would babble incoherently and discredit themselves in public.”29 The CIA certainly wasn’t looking to cause mind expansion. Their own documents said the acid could “produce serious insanity for 8-18 hours and possibly longer.” ABC News showed CIA documents citing how CIA MK-Ultra’s Dr. Sidney Gottlieb carried LSD overseas to dose leftist foreign diplomats and statesmen. Egyptian President Gamal Abdal Nasser, one of Africa’s most outspoken leaders, was on the hit list.30 The CIA concealed exactly how and if the leaders on that hit list were dosed, but did they give these leaders massive LSD doses in an attempt to also cause subtle brain damage? The assassination of the Congo independence leader Patrice Lumumba represents a well-documented example of U.S. and European attacks on African independence leaders with MK-Ultra scientists’ aid. The U.S. became the first country to recognize the claims of Belgium’s King Leopold II to the territories of the Congo Basin. Brutal economic exploitation under Leopold II resulted in millions of Congolese deaths. The U.S. acquired a stake in the Congo’s minerals. The U.S. military used uranium from Congolese mines for manufacturing atomic weapons.31 As various African countries began to gain their independence, the Belgian Congo’s Patrice Lumumba organized the Mouvement National Congolais in 1958. The Congolese people elected the 34-year-old to be their Prime Minister in 1960. In his acceptance speech, Lumumba said the Congo’s independence ‘‘put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed on us by force.”32", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:45:991d89975067", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3330, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "Congolese deaths.

The Congressional Church Committee found that CIA director Allen Dulles ordered Lumumba’s assassination.34 The CIA’s MK-Ultra director Sidney Gottlieb aided this assassination, devising a poison resembling toothpaste, and he flew to the Congo with it. Lumumba was assassinated in January of 1961.35 Details on the role of the poison in the assassination remain unknown. 1 On largest addict population, estimated at 40 million Chinese addicts, and mass detox, see C.P.

Henry Luce, the founder of Time and former Life magazines, was a close friend of CIA Director Allen Dulles, who held that position from 1953-61.

During Jackson’s decades-long career at Time Inc., he took several breaks for U.S. intelligence leadership work. He was deputy chief of the Psychological Warfare Division, and functioned as outside director of CIA covert operations. He later worked as Special Adviser to President Eisenhower for Psychological Warfare, and more closely enmeshed the media propaganda unit with the covert operations unit of the CIA. Jackson used Time Inc.’s publications for psychological manipulation of society at home and abroad.2 Jackson embodied the violently anti-Semitic, racist, anti-leftist belief system typical of the wealthiest oligarchical families with whom he helped start the CIA. The rabid anti-Communist agenda they carried out, which barred thousands of people from work, exemplified Jackson and his Psychological Warfare Division’s opinion and influence.3 Jackson’s psychological warfare operations also targeted black cultural leaders. One of his propaganda projects financed black musicians, writers and actors who didn’t comment on U.S. racism, eroding the livelihood of activist black writers and performing artists.4 One of C.D. Jackson’s activist targets was the African-American singer Paul Robeson, who overcame institutionalized racism while becoming the most accomplished black entertainer of the first half of the 20th century. An extensive report from military intelligence to FBI Director Hoover detailed the close intelligence surveillance of Robeson and his wife as early as 1951, according to an FBI memo discussing his friend Richard Wright.5 Robeson had achieved much in a wide variety of endeavors by the 1930s. After becoming an All-American football player at Rutgers University, he went on to graduate from Columbia Law School. He starred in plays and then movies, while also receiving honors as a world-renowned singer. Robeson’s activism included raising money against Spain’s fascist Generalissimo Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s. Robeson told President Truman that if he refused to sponsor anti-lynching legislation to stop the ongoing murders of southern blacks, they would arm themselves for self-defense.6 Robeson spoke more than twenty languages, including Russian, Chinese, and several African languages. When the government returned Robeson’s passport in 1958, he decided to live in the Soviet Union, where he said he experienced less racism. Robeson was on close terms with Jawaharlal Nehru, Jomo Kenyatta, and other Third World leaders. He always planned to return to the U.S. to help lead the emerging civil rights movement.9 While Robeson was in the Soviet Union, he arranged a trip to Cuba for a meeting with President Fidel Castro and revolutionary leader Ernesto “Che” Guevara, scheduled for two years after Castro’s revolution and two weeks before the failed U.S. “Bay of Pigs” invasion of Cuba.

In lectures, interviews, and articles, Robeson’s son, Paul Robeson Jr., detailed how U.S. and British intelligence orchestrated a chemical attack on his father, partly to stop At the time, Paul Robeson was staying at a hotel in Russia. A large group of anti-Soviet Americans connected to the U.S. government had a large party in the rooms next door to Robeson’s. Some of the Americans talked Robeson into joining the party where they gave him a drink that caused him to experience the symptoms of an LSD trip (note, Robeson said it was either a large dose of LSD or the more potent BZ, in different speeches). When Robeson’s son went to check on his father the next day, someone also dosed his drink with a hallucinogenic. Robeson Jr. said that when he came down from his trip he was able to function again and help his father when he came out of the hallucinogenic trip.11 Several days later, Paul Robeson re-experienced the hallucinogenic trip and depressive symptoms. Doctors and associates talked his wife into having him go into a psychiatric hospital near London, where they kept him for two years and gave him fifty-four electric convulsive treatments at levels much higher than those used today. His son found that this, along with drug therapy used at the British hospital, matched the CIA’s Project MK-Ultra “mind depatterning” technique.12 Within months of Robeson’s treatments, another leftist artist, writer Ernest Hemingway, also experienced the same damaging treatments while U.S. intelligence closely spied on him.13 When Paul Robeson Sr. came back to the United States, someone dosed his drink yet again. Robeson felt he couldn’t fully recover from the more recent incident. He kept himself out of the public eye until his death fifteen years later, to avoid tarnishing his legacy. The CIA had effectively neutralized him.14 Robeson’s son subsequently lectured about his father’s targeting. He also told Julia Wright he believed that her father, the renowned African-American novelist Richard Wright, a close friend and political ally of Paul Robeson, was similarly targeted with LSD. With the 1940 publication of Native Son, Wright had become the first best-selling African-American novelist. While a mass of evidence supports the contention that U.S. intelligence targeted Wright due to his leftist political activism, adequate evidence for the use of psychedelics in that targeting has yet to appear, though it seems clear that intelligence-manipulated media played a role in an organized attempt to discredit him.

Richard Wright continued his literary success with the bestseller Black Boy: A Record of Childhood and Youth, published in 1944. In 1945, an article about Wright in Time-owned Life magazine showed a picture of unidentified adults putting a glass (of something) to a young boy’s lips, with an outrageous caption: “At the age of 6, Richard Wright became a drunkard.” Wright’s FBI files contained a 1951 military intelligence memorandum to FBI Director Hoover discussing surveillance of Wright’s meetings with Paul Robeson. In 1960, Richard Wright spent many hours discussing strategy with Martin Luther King. In November of 1960, Wright also made a long speech discussing tactics U.S. intelligence was using in America, in Paris where he resided, and against his friend Patrice Lumumba in the Congo. It was filmed and first broadcast on November 28 on Radio Television Francaise as the first of four installments. On the same day as the November broadcast, Richard Wright mysteriously died in a French hospital after being admitted for an ongoing mild stomach ailment. Doctors had just given Wright an otherwise clean bill of health during that hospital admission. Ollie Harrington said Wright had forewarned him of French and U.S. intelligence carrying out his murder during such a hospital stay and had developed procedures to protect himself. Harrington said this was the first time Wright strayed from those procedures. Authorities said Wright died of a heart attack and, despite family suspicions of murder, no autopsy was done.15 The Beatniks, or Beats, wrote popular poems and books with radical political content that countered racism, anti-Communism, and the war industry. Although Senator Joseph McCarthy had been discredited in 1956, people still feared the anti-Communist witchhunts. Just after McCarthy’s discrediting that year, Beat poet Allen Ginsberg published two famous poems with radical leftist sentiments. Psychiatrists who had worked for the U.S. Navy and U.S. intelligence gave Allen Ginsberg his first LSD dose in 1959, as part of the CIA MK-Ultra experiments.16 Acid, the popular term for LSD, diverted Ginsberg and some other Beats. Ginsberg’s friend Jack Kerouac wrote the highly acclaimed classic On the Road in the early 1950s, and later The Dharma Bums. In the latter book, Kerouac created a lead character who took psychedelic drugs.17 Within a few years, Allen Ginsberg partly weaned himself away from psychedelics.

Ginsberg started feeling depressed about his drug “trips.” In 1961 he visited eminent Jewish philosopher Martin Buber in Israel, and an Indian swami who influenced him away from acid. While in Japan in mid-1963 he wrote a poem titled “The Change” about leaving psychedelics behind.18 Another Beat writer, William S. Burroughs, took an immediate dislike for psychedelics. Burroughs was no prude about drugs, and had written several books related to his heroin addiction. He was hooked on heroin and wrote about it while living in Tangiers, producing Naked Lunch, a literary blockbuster. The U.S. tried to ban Naked Lunch, but many called it a work of allegorical genius. Naked Lunch beat the ban, selling well.19 Burroughs’s fame grew as large as his Beat generation friend Jack Kerouac’s. In their book Acid Dreams, Lee and Shlain noted Burroughs’s comments on psychedelics. Looking back on the era, Burroughs eventually said, “LSD makes people less competent.” About the forces behind LSD, he added, “You can see their motivation for turning people on [to acid]. Very often it’s not necessary to give it more than just a little push. Make it available and the news media takes it up, and there it is. They don’t have to stick their necks out very much.”20 At the immediate risk of finding myself the most unpopular character of all fiction – and history is fiction – I must say this: Bring together stay of news – Inquire onward from state to doer – Who monopolized Immortality?

The wealthiest oligarchy and their U.S. intelligence apparatus faced a The most serious emerged in the 1950s in the form of movies and music, particularly popular youth music. The FBI eventually admitted having started files on musicians such as Elvis Presley in the mid-’50s and other musicians thereafter, but never fully disclosed the reasons.22 In the early ’50s, Allan Freed, a half-Latino Jewish disc jockey in Cleveland was credited with introducing rock music to large white audiences. White crooners such as Perry Como dominated pop radio at the start of that decade. Freed was the first large-city deejay to introduce danceable black rhythm and blues musicians to white audiences at a time when most stations only allowed white musicians’ songs. Freed was credited with coining the term “rock and roll,” which he borrowed from a black slang term for sex. Freed, under the moniker Moondog, drummed pencils and howled to songs.

He inspired other small stations nationwide to develop his R&B format, soon forcing large stations to follow suit.23 By 1952 Freed’s soaring influence could not be denied. That year, 25,000 people, two-thirds of them white, came to a 10,000-seat arena for Freed’s first concert.24 A few years later, Jewish mobster Morris Levy signed a deal with Allan Freed and influenced him to accept a huge salary as a deejay at WINS, one of New York City’s top music stations. Freed’s program became #1 within months.25 Levy and former OSS agent John McCaw appeared to use Allan Freed for more nefarious reasons. McCaw attended meetings of the U.S. intelligence umbrella group, the National Security Council, as he served on their Advisory Council.26 After Freed helped make WINS the country’s most popular music station, McCaw implemented changes at the station in 1957 that shaped the rock music world. WINS led the nationwide promotion of the Top 40 music format. This format helped large money interests gain the most dominant influence and control over top music sales through promotion money and radio play menus.27 It would further aid censorship of political songs by barring them from radio play. Levy, an associate of the Genovese Mafia family, owned top New York jazz clubs and song publishing rights. The Genovese family, started by Vito Genovese and U.S. intelligence collaborator Charles “Lucky” Luciano, were the first of the five Mafia families to break the code of not dealing drugs and were the first family to work with U.S. intelligence. The Italian Mafia took over from the Jewish mobsters who had dominated the drug trade in the 1920s.28 With the help of Freed’s popularity, Levy started the jazz and rock record label, Roulette Records, in 1956. An Assistant U.S. Attorney claimed that Roulette Records was also a way station for heroin trafficking around that time.29 Powerful forces started a continuous assault on Freed the following year. In 1958, when violence occurred outside a Boston arena at a Freed show, authorities indicted Freed for inciting a riot. This became a common accusation against leftist musicians and activists.30 Although charges were dropped against Freed, McCaw fired him in 1958. On the day Freed was fired, a gunman looked for him in the WINS studio before Freed escaped. It was alleged that the gunman was an upset concert promoter.31 Allan Freed went to work for WABC, but researchers believe Freed was set up there and scapegoated when Orrin Hatch’s congressional committee focused exclusively", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:54:17e7d0fc4512", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3339, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "indicted Freed for inciting a riot.

It was alleged that the gunman was an upset concert promoter.31 Allan Freed went to work for WABC, but researchers believe Freed was set up there and scapegoated when Orrin Hatch’s congressional committee focused exclusively on him in the “payola” scandals in 1959. The term implied a “pay to play” bribe for certain songs. Morris Levy, the source of much of the payola money to play his records, was never called to testify. Fredric Dannen, author of the bestselling book, Hit Men, said these deals weren’t illegal then, and were only considered misdemeanors thereafter. Nonetheless, the scandal effectively ended Freed’s career around 1960. He died of alcoholism five years later.32 Elvis Presley was apolitical, but socially radical for his time, defying racism and segregation. Elvis embraced African-American music and star of his era. He countered segregationist attitudes by expressing great admiration for black musicians and broke segregation rules in regularly attending black-only shows and events both before and after he was famous. At least a dozen black celebrities, from Muhammad Ali to Fats Domino, whom Elvis called the real “King of Rock and Roll,” defended their friend Elvis against accusations of racism, as did investigating black magazines.33 Reports of Elvis’s racism stemmed from Sepia magazine reprinting a rumor in 1957. A writer from another magazine, Jet, investigated the rumor that year and stated that it was unfounded. Furthermore, while Elvis profited off a racist music marketplace that segregated black music, he credited black musicians with creating rock.34 John Trudell experienced murderous U.S. intelligence attacks that killed his whole family. In the 1980s Trudell turned to music. On his Jackson Browneproduced debut CD, AKA Grafitti Man, Trudell included a song about Elvis titled “Baby Boom Che.” Trudell said that in this song he felt Elvis was revolutionary in terms of freeing men to express their emotions openly.35 As noted, the FBI admitted starting a file on Elvis Presley by the mid-1950s. Colonel Tom Parker talked Elvis into a management deal in 1955 when Elvis was twenty years old and already a star. In 1948, Tom Parker had received the rank of Colonel in the Louisiana State Militia, which was involved in major U.S. intelligence covert operations.37 Elvis’s former manager, Memphis radio deejay Bob Neal, reportedly couldn’t accommodate Elvis’s success and let Parker take over some duties. Parker took complete control over Elvis Presley’s management and his life. Did Parker do this on behalf of U.S. intelligence?

In the late 1950s the Army drafted Elvis and mainly stationed him in Germany from 1958-60.38 As previously noted, MK-Ultra was conducting operations with former Nazi intelligence at their military bases in Germany. A close associate of Elvis said Parker introduced Elvis to amphetamines early on, and Elvis started using them heavily while in the Army.39 Researchers claimed that “the Elvis Presley who emerged from the army in 1960 would bear little resemblance to the Elvis who entered the service in 1958.”40 John Lennon, who was watching Elvis’s career closely, would later state on BBC Radio One: “When Elvis died, people were harassing me for a comment. I’ll give it to you now. Elvis died when he went into the army. That’s when they killed him, that’s when they castrated him. The rest of it was just a living death.”41 Many say that Parker and Esposito, along with several other of the “Memphis Mafia” who worked with Elvis, at least allowed, if not encouraged, his increasingly dangerous drug problem. In the 1960s and 1970s, Elvis’s addiction led to multiple near-death overdoses and concerts where reports stated he could barely function.46 If Colonel Parker and his associates worked for U.S. intelligence, as their control of Elvis suggests, the wealthiest had power over a music star with influence over millions of fans. Bloated, overweight, 42-year-old Elvis Presley was found dead on the floor of his bathroom in 1977. Before the autopsy was complete and toxicology was known, medical examiner Jerry Francisco declared cardiac arrhythmia as the cause of death. Within months, two lab reports said that “polypharmacy” was heavily implicated.47 Elvis’s doctor George Nichopoulos had written prescriptions for 10,000 doses of amphetamines, sedatives and narcotics in Elvis’s name for the eight months before the singer’s death. Dr. Nichopoulos’s license was suspended for three months. In the 1990s the state medical board revoked the doctor’s license for overprescribing.48 Was Nichopoulos working for U.S. intelligence before losing his immunity in the 1990s? 12 Personal Interview, Julia Wright, 6/18/08, Paris.

In the 1960s, SDS members became Freedom Riders to combat racial inequality in the South, joining forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to desegregate buses, register southern blacks to vote, and for other civil rights. Mostly-white SDS increased in numbers nationwide.3 In the early 1960s, civil rights demonstrations and marches began exploding onto newspaper front pages in the U.S. and abroad. On the 1st of October of 1962, in Oxford, Mississippi, mobs killed two residents and a French journalist, while injuring 375, in an unsuccessful attempt at stopping the integration of the University of Mississippi. In Birmingham, Alabama, fire marshals used firehoses on civil rights demonstrators. The high-pressure water hoses caused broken legs and caved in rib cages. Arrests were made by the hundreds. 4 Besides dosing leftist leaders, when the civil rights movement and its media assets and agents to promote LSD to the masses. After writing the definitive book on the politics of heroin, Professor Alfred McCoy studied CIA interrogation. He found that from 1953 to 1963, the CIA received funding of $25 million for mind-control research, with MK-Ultra supervising 149 projects and 33 subprojects.5 With researchers finding that LSD led many to “personality deterioration toward a nonactivist role in society,” conservative Hudson Institute think-tank consultants would later reveal their purpose of having “social control” over many young people and creating a “dropped out” society.6 The previously mentioned superspy and uranium entrepreneur, Captain Al Hubbard, worked for the Treasury Department, the Federal Narcotics Bureau and the Food and Drug Administration at the same time the latter two organizations assisted the CIA’s drug-testing programs.7 During the 1960s Hubbard worked for the major defense-contracting company Teledyne.8 Top CIA personnel involved in MK-Ultra knew Hubbard well.9 By the late 1960s, Hubbard worked for the Stanford Research Institute.

Author Hank Albarelli reported: “Throughout the 1950s, Hubbard received large shipments of LSD directly from Sandoz in Switzerland, with Agency [CIA] approval.”11 With unlimited access, Hubbard flew around North America and Europe supplying distributors with vast amounts of LSD.12 British psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond had joined forces with Hubbard in the early 1950s, shortly after Hubbard tried his first hit of LSD. Osmond received CIA funds for his work in Canada with LSD.13 An associate of Hubbard’s said that with Osmond’s help, Hubbard had influenced, “a prime minister, assistants to heads of state, UN representatives and members of the British parliament,” to participate in LSD sessions. Hubbard said, “My job was to sit on the couch next to the psychiatrist and put the people through it, which I did.”14 These targets were likely an expansion of the number of leftists on the CIA’s original acid hit list for possible mental damage. Researcher Martin Lee said Hubbard gave LSD to thousands of people from all walks of life—policemen, statesmen, captains of industry, church figures and scientists. Hubbard had such vast influence he even obtained papers from the Vatican granting him permission to use LSD within the context of the Catholic Church, using it on certain priests. (Were these “liberation” theologists or similarly activist leftists?)15 Hubbard brought large stashes of acid to a Los Angeles psychiatrist who introduced it to philosopher Alan Watts, researchers Sidney Cohen, Keith Ditman and Arthur Chandler. A Hubbard-supplied psychiatrist also gave LSD to influential writers like Anais Nin and entertainers Jack Nicholson, James Coburn, Lord Buckley and Cary Grant. 16 Time Inc., with its strong U.S. intelligence connections, promoted positive quotes by these public figures, and published generally positive articles with quotes from “expert” psychiatrists about LSD.17 While Time/Life’s owner, Henry Luce, was a close friend of CIA Director Allen Dulles,18 Time’s Vice President C.D. Jackson continued to work for U.S. intelligence, particularly regarding culture manipulation in the Psychological Warfare Division. Jackson also headed various CIA front groups, like the Congress of Cultural Freedom, which obtained approximately $200, 000 for administrative costs in 1951 (equivalent to $1.7 million in 2011) and tens of millions of dollars from the CIA over the next seventeen years to influence all", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:61:71ccf9eeb043", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3346, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "While Time/Life’s owner, Henry Luce, was a close friend of CIA Director Allen Dulles,18 Time’s Vice President C.D.

This title was common in mainstream media, the nickname suggesting that undercover agents such as Hubbard were well meaning. In the same period, high-level CIA whistleblowers countered any good intentions of the agents involved in CIA tasks, reporting that the CIA carried out genocidal operations globally.20 From approximately 1955 until 1966, undercover MK-Ultra agents employed prostitutes to dose people. CIA agent George Hunter White and others paid drug-addicted prostitutes in both New York and San Francisco to pose as non-professionals. They would pick up men and bring them back to safe houses where the men would be unknowingly dosed with LSD. It remains uncertain if these were actual targets or test subjects, but the fact that these operations were run in areas of leftist activism suggests the former.21 As early as 1962, professors at Brandeis University (near Boston), organized for university reform that could help spread leftist ideas and leftist activism. Top leftist sociologist, Herbert Marcuse, taught there and helped bring together a conference with other leftist professors including Paul Goodman, and SDS leaders such as Tom Hayden. SDS members wrote about it in their school newspapers.22 A PBS special noted President John Kennedy’s moves towards integration: “In 1962 President Kennedy sent hundreds of U.S. marshals to enforce a court order to admit African American James Meredith to the University of Mississippi. The marshals encountered fierce resistance from violent segregationists. In a melee, two people were killed and dozens injured.” White activists came from the North to aid SNCC and Martin Luther King Jr.’s organization in the South. Southern racists continued their reaction to these inroads with ever-increasing violence towards civil rights organizers, soon bombing organizers’ homes and offices. Blacks rioted in response.23 Between June and October of 1964, twenty-four Black churches were bombed in Mississippi alone.24 Segregationists set off so many bombs in Birmingham, Alabama, it became known as “Bombingham.” It remains uncertain what role U.S. intelligence played in these racist attacks. A professor’s book, The Informant, detailed the work of undercover FBI agent, Gary Rowe, who was “in the vicinity of just about every conflagration of racial violence in the virulently segregated Alabama of the early 1960s. He was around for beatings, bombings, ultimately even murder.” The book said he almost never arrested anyone and kept several top", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:62:73e29b0caa7b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3347, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "so many bombs in Birmingham, Alabama, it became known as “Bombingham.” It remains uncertain what role U.S. intelligence played in these racist attacks.

He was around for beatings, bombings, ultimately even murder.” The book said he almost never arrested anyone and kept several top Klansmen from getting arrested after their brutal crimes. With the CIA leadership’s vehemently racist history regarding the eugenics movement, did undercover agents take an active role in fomenting these racist attacks?25 In 1963, King led a civil rights march to Washington D.C. where he delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Folk singer Bob Dylan played at that event and influenced young whites to get involved in civil rights activism. Within a few years, Dylan sidelined himself from activism after using psychedelics and taking on the motto “Better Living through Chemistry.” The temporary but increasing blurriness of this once brilliant mind can be heard in interviews from late 1965 to 1968. (Note that Dylan also had a serious motorcycle accident in July of 1966. Proof of U.S. intelligence directly targeting Dylan is lacking.)26 One of the largest civil rights groups was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). While activists founded CORE in Chicago, the New York chapter was considered indistinguishable from the Chicago national office, due to so many CORE leaders living in New York. A large wave of white leftist students joined in 1961. They became Freedom Riders that summer and the following few summers.27 The civil rights movement and white student support brought major changes for the cause. In 1963 alone, Americans held 1,412 demonstrations. More and more white Northern students traveled down South for the Freedom Rides to register black voters. The white segregationist backlash culminated in the 1964 murders of three SNCC members—two Jewish activists from New York, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, along with a black activist from Mississippi, James Chaney. Evidence suggests that police aided the Ku Klux Klan in killing them.28 The increase of activism coincided with an increase of U.S. intelligence’s LSD, help came from MI6, the British version of the CIA. While a former MI6 agent claimed MI6 supervised the CIA’s work promulgating LSD and other drug use, the truth of this can’t be ascertained.29 As previously noted, Britain’s Tavistock Institute ran a congruent operation with the CIA’s MK-Ultra regarding the use of acid as a spy weapon.30 Britain’s Michael Hollingshead dosed many unsuspecting foreign leaders through his job at the United Nations. Hollingshead threw parties at his Fifth Avenue apartment where he invited people from the U.N, reportedly covering his entire apartment with LSD so anyone who touched anything got a dose of acid involuntarily.31 In a memoir, Hollingshead", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:63:7bf8714a4416", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3348, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "of this can’t be ascertained.29 As previously noted, Britain’s Tavistock Institute ran a congruent operation with the CIA’s MK-Ultra regarding the use of acid as a spy weapon.30 Britain’s Michael Hollingshead dosed many unsuspecting foreign leaders through his job at the United Nations. Hollingshead threw parties at his Fifth Avenue apartment where he invited people from the U.N, reportedly covering his entire apartment with LSD so anyone who touched anything got a dose of acid involuntarily.31 In a memoir, Hollingshead said he was on a “crusade to launch LSD on the world!” as if for the love of humanity.32 Hollingshead’s links to the CIA and British intelligence suggest the more insidious shared motives of the CIA’s Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and Richard Helms. Hollingshead said that in 1961 he worked as executive secretary of the Institute for British American Cultural Exchange, “a semi-official British propaganda agency in the field of international cultural relations where creating propaganda was a primary task.” British police detective Dick Lee called Hollingshead’s organization the “British Council,” which was heavily funded by King George VI in 1940, while also working partly for the British government in “cultural propaganda,” much like the CIA.33 Michael Hollingshead further revealed that CIA asset Lionel Trilling served on his Institute for British American Cultural Exchange’s board of directors. For her book, The Cultural Cold War, Frances Stonor Saunders interviewed key people who verified that Trilling knowingly accepted CIA aid for his work over many years and was highly involved in CIA work. Trilling recommended the director for a CIA front group, the Fairfield Foundation, and he worked on acquiring funds for the American Committee for Cultural Freedom. Saunders found that the CIA’s Psychological Strategy Board supervised the American Committee for Cultural Freedom. She also found the Fairfield Foundation was meant to be a cover for CIA funding of artists and writers, paying for Trilling’s trips to Poland, Rome, Athens and Berlin.35 In 1961, Michael Hollingshead, with CIA approval, bought a gram of LSD. This amount allowed him to make 10,000 hits of the drug, which he did with the help of a physician associate in New York. Hollingshead went to Harvard University with a mayonnaise jar full of these doses, which he distributed liberally.36 In 1964, when William S. Burroughs printed his warnings about LSD, the CIA’s MK-Ultra projects already had vast covert programs to promote its use on both American coasts. On the East Coast at Boston’s Harvard University, Psychology Professor Timothy Leary ran experiments (also conducted at other schools nationwide) where professors received grants to pay students to take psychedelic drugs. A group called the Human Ecology Fund gave Leary and other professors the money for this work.37 MK-Ultra scientists gave depositions about the start of the Human Ecology Fund.

The CIA started it in 1959 at Cornell University Medical School in New York City as a covert funding source for various MK-Ultra projects. Besides Cornell and Harvard, it involved other prestigious universities near hotbeds of student activism, such as Stanford University near Berkeley, California, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where student-led civil rights activism had made considerable headway. Harvard, Stanford, Hopkins and Yale had all been hotbeds for eugenics, suggesting why they spearheaded these experiments. Harvard, Stanford and Cornell Medical Schools became epicenters for MK-Ultra activities, paying student volunteers to take part in experiments with psychedelics, from mushrooms to LSD. Many of the volunteer students had poor, ethnic immigrant backgrounds and were in need of the money to help pay their way in school. 38 In total, the CIA allocated $7–13 million for 44 colleges and universities to conduct this research (twelve hospitals and 24 other institutions received MK-Ultra funds and conducted similar experiments).39 Up to this time, Prof. Leary had done tests only with psilocybin (mushrooms). Leary hadn’t tried LSD and said he wasn’t eager to begin, as he believed one psychedelic was like all others. Researcher Martin Lee detailed how in 1961, Hollingshead first convinced Leary to try acid with him, after Leary’s initial refusal. Lee noted that Hollingshead gave Leary about six times the normal dose of acid, which had Leary “tripping” for three days. The experience led Leary to consider Hollingshead his guru. Leary’s closest Harvard Psilocybin Project associates, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, were upset to see Leary in a helpless state and blamed Hollingshead for having “blown [Leary’s] mind” in the destructive sense. Lee described Hollingshead as very witty, and the potbellied Brit eventually convinced doubters Alpert and Metzner, along with other Harvard associates, to sample the acid from his mayonnaise jar. Soon after they started using LSD as part of their research.40 This fell in line with CIA MK-Ultra goals regarding LSD. The United States Senate’s Church Committee would eventually investigate and publish a little-known report detailing MK-Ultra. It stated that one goal of MK-Ultra was to manipulate foreign leaders after dosing them with LSD. The Senate Select Committee’s report cited a memorandum from the Director of Security to [MK-Ultra subproject] Artichoke, Subject: “ARTICHOKE Restatement of Program.” It stated that the CIA was using LSD “in order to develop means for the control of the activities and mental capacities of individuals whether willing or not.”41 This source also cited the use of LSD on unwitting Americans.

This and other evidence indicates MK-Ultra similarly worked against American cultural and political leaders at home. Harvard University expelled Leary and Alpert in 1963 for taking too much LSD with the subjects of their experimentation. The two International Federation of Internal Freedom (IFIF) and Leary’s “guru” Hollingshead joined them in this venture. They opened offices in Boston, New York, Los Angeles and headquarters in Mexico near Acapulco. Mexico expelled them after six weeks, but not before the group acquired 3,000 dues-paying members.44 IFIF quickly found new benefactors and participants. Peggy Mellon Hitchcock opened IFIF’s New York office, and her brother, William Mellon Hitchcock, rented IFIF his 4,000-acre estate in Duchess County, N.Y. for only $500 a month. At the center of the estate was Millbrook, a sixty-fourroom mansion, where Leary lived and set up shop. They started a major expansion of the weekly LSD parties that MK-Ultra scientist Harold Abramson had thrown at his Long Island home. Much evidence supports the notion that the CIA’s MK-Ultra guided IFIF. William Hitchcock’s uncle, Andrew Mellon, was a wealthy Pittsburgh financier (Mellon Bank), and Hitchcock’s grandfather, William Larimer Mellon founded Gulf Oil (later Chevron), one of the largest oil companies in the world.45 During the 1940s, the Mellon family held U.S. intelligence posts in Madrid, London, Geneva and Paris.46 Paul Mellon worked for the Special Operations Executive in London while his sister, Alisa (once known as the world’s richest woman), was married to his OSS London chief.47 Europe OSS operations chief Allen Dulles supervised them at that time. Later Dulles supervised all of U.S. intelligence as CIA Director, overseeing eight-plus years of MK-Ultra, until President John F. Kennedy replaced him in 1961.48 Martin Lee noted how “certain influential members of the Mellon family maintained close ties with the CIA. Mellon family foundations have been used repeatedly as conduits for Agency funds. Notably, Richard Helms was a frequent guest of the Mellon patriarchs in Pittsburgh during his tenure as CIA director (1966-1973).”49 While Timothy Leary, Hollingshead and Alpert lived in Bill Hitchcock’s mansion, Hitchcock stayed a half-mile away in a private four-bedroom house. As a millionaire and member of one of the country’s wealthiest families, he threw many parties for his elite social circles. Despite a $65, 000 /month allowance from his trust fund, Bill Hitchcock also still worked each morning, talking with Swiss and Bahamian bankers.

The CIA used both for covert operations such as laundering cocaine money with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). He kept At the Millbrook mansion, Hollingshead apparently had access to various new CIA drugs and used Alpert as a guinea pig. When Alpert went to sleep early one night with a cold, Hollingshead injected him with the short-acting superpsychedelic DMT. After, while Alpert was still high on the DMT, Hollingshead gave him800 micrograms of LSD. Later, Alpert believed he could fly and jumped out of a second-story window, ending up with a broken leg.51 Several top government psychiatrists and physicians regularly passed through or set up an office at Millbrook. Max “Feelgood” Jacobson worked in the White House. At Millbrook, Jacobson injected people with psychedelics.52 He would later give regular injections to members of artist Andy Warhol’s “Factory” in New York City. Martin Lee called Millbrook the “Psychedelic Central for the whole East Coast.” It attracted jazz musicians including Steve Swallow and Charles Lloyd. Philosopher R.D. Laing joined the party, as did cartoonist Saul Steinberg and left-wing satirist Paul Krassner. Krassner said Hollingshead guided his trip.54 NASA scientist Steve Groff created a new military incapacitating agent: JB-118; its action was similar to that of the Army’s BZ. Both were potent superhallucinogenics that made users feel they were in free fall, and gave them bizarre visions. Millbrook resident Ralph Metzner said Millbrook attendees took these drugs. They proceeded to see things that were not there, along with walking into furniture and doors. Another Millbrook visitor named Arthur Kleps swore that Hollingshead placed a few thousand micrograms of pure Sandoz acid in some brandy by his bed. Kleps ended up founding the Neo-American Boohoo Church in 1966. He declared LSD a sacrament and sought protection under the law similar to Native Americans’ sacrament of peyote. A judge ruled against the Boohoos, saying that a group with “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” as its theme couldn’t be taken seriously enough to qualify as a church.56 Researcher Lee reported that Leary, Hollingshead and their associates tried to “program” people’s trips in “ways analogous to that of the CIA and the military.” While Lee assumed Hollingshead’s associates and the CIA had different goals, the work of Humphrey Osmond and Al Hubbard indicates the opposite.57 These MK-Ultra figures, along with Hollingshead and Bill Mellon Hitchcock, make it clear that U.S. and British intelligence had their own covert psychedelic guinea pig farm at Millbrook.

They accomplished domestically the same task that MK-Ultra directors Gottlieb and Hubbard had conducted abroad with their “psychedelic hit list.” Timothy Leary and his CIA associates also ran an advertising campaign for acid. Leary linked LSD to sex. He first called it a shortcut to mystical enlightenment. Later he talked about it as a new form of radical politics, to appeal to activists, calling it “erotic politics.” He also called it a “cure for homosexuality” and said it led women to have several hundred orgasms during an LSD session. TV film crews regularly appeared at Millbrook, broadening Leary’s propaganda worldwide.58 Eventually, Duchess County parents got upset when their teens visited Millbrook. They got local sheriff, and future Watergate conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy to break down Millbrook’s door, arresting Leary amongst a group watching a film of a waterfall. The Supreme Court overturned Leary’s arrest, purportedly because he wasn’t read his rights. After the arrest, Liddy set up a roadblock and submitted people 1 Kenneth Cloke, A Brief History of Civil Liberties Protest Movements in Berkeley – From TASC to SLATE to FSM (1957-1965) (Santa Monica, CA: CDR Press, 1994), pp. 20-27. 2 Kirkpatrick Sale, SDS: The rise and development of the Students for a Democratic Society … (New York: Vintage, 1973), p. 16.

At the University of California-Berkeley in 1957, student activists formed the campus political party SLATE, which promoted the right of students to protest for racial equality, free speech, and voluntary, rather than the then-mandatory, male participation in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).1 Besides civil rights, people were protesting Senator Joe McCarthy’s Red Scare about Communism at that time.2 In 1959 the House Un-American Activities Committee conducted a public interrogation of leftist activists in San Francisco. These diverse activists included a Cal-Berkeley sophomore, a popular local antiwar radio deejay, several members of the Longshoremen’s Union, and some members of the Communist Party. Berkeley’s student newspaper, The Daily Cal, printed a front-page article calling for students to protest the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, recommending that people use the tactic of laughing loudly at HUAC’s ridiculous questions and statements. The Longshoremen’s Union and others also came out to protest and picket the events.3 Television journalists filmed the events at the City", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:72:c74b8b3535ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3357, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 73, "text": "a Cal-Berkeley sophomore, a popular local antiwar radio deejay, several members of the Longshoremen’s Union, and some members of the Communist Party.

The Longshoremen’s Union and others also came out to protest and picket the events.3 Television journalists filmed the events at the City Hall for the evening news. So many protesters turned up at one event that police trained fire hoses on them, flooding the inside of the building. After a raucous three days of hearings and protests, HUAC subpoenaed the film from the San Francisco television stations covering the events. A HUAC researcher edited the film with narration, adding some fictional elements and speeches by members of HUAC, titling it Operation Abolition. 4 According to articles about this movie, more than eight million people viewed it nationwide. Some groups agreed with its intention of locking up the Communists. Others used it to organize people against the HUAC trials. In another movie, Berkeley in the Sixties, activists said that their colleges showed Operation Abolition to students in an effort to warn them not to be duped by Communists. It had the opposite effect, leading many leftist students to transfer to Berkeley in order to “be where the action is.”5 In the early 1960s, Berkeley student activists became involved in civil rights work. In what the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee dubbed “Freedom Summer” in 1964, a number of Berkeley students went on Freedom Rides to Mississippi. When they got back to Berkeley’s campus that fall, they set up tables to raise money and educate students about these civil rights groups. Like many colleges, the University of California at Berkeley did not allow fundraising for any political parties except the Democratic and Republican school clubs. Students and faculty were also upset about loyalty oaths (to the U.S. government) required of faculty. Faculty faced negative academic pressure if they tried to discuss socialist or anarchist history and ideas with students. For some, refusing to take the oath led to dismissal, and to debates about academic freedom. In mid-September of 1964, one of the deans announced a ban on political tables that students often manned at the corner of Bancroft and Telegraph Avenues. A protest ensued that erupted into 3,000 people sitting around a police car to stop the arrest of activist Jack Weinberg, while also using the car as a podium for speeches. That December, upset about the administration singling out student leaders for punishment, several thousand students took over Sproul Hall in a last-ditch tactic to reopen negotiations with the Berkeley administration on political free speech and actions on campus.6 Mario Savio, a Berkeley student who had joined the civil rights Freedom Riders that summer,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:73:33777d55b015", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3358, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "erupted into 3,000 people sitting around a police car to stop the arrest of activist Jack Weinberg, while also using the car as a podium for speeches.

Savio recommended a radical solution: There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes one so sick at heart, that you can’t take part, you can’t even tacitly take part, and you have to put your body upon the gears and the wheels, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to stop it. You’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working.7 On cue from there, the demonstrators marched into the administrative offices of Sproul Hall and occupied its four floors.8 District attorney, and Ronald Reagan’s future U.S. Attorney General, Edwin Meese III got permission from Governor Edmund Brown Sr., and arrested some 800 students at 2 a.m., before releasing them several hours later. The University of California brought charges against the organizers, so students held larger protests that all but shut down the Berkeley campus. In January 1965, the administration of the new acting chancellor finally backed down. The school established provisional rules for political activity on the Berkeley campus, allowed open discussion for members of all political groups at Sproul Hall during certain hours of the day, and permitted tables for leafleting. That spring, the students and organizers started the Vietnam Day Committee. This group helped spark the anti-Vietnam War movement nationwide.9 Once again, an increase of MK-Ultra operations coincided with this same area of increased activism. In the late 1950s, aspiring writer Ken Kesey attended Stanford University’s prestigious writing program. Kesey had also been an alternate on the 1960 U.S. Olympic wrestling team and had stated he had never even been drunk on beer, much less done any drugs at that time.10 As an impoverished student while at Stanford, Kesey participated in one of MK-Ultra’s Human Ecology Fund LSD experiment programs at Menlo Park Hospital in 1960. Writer Robert Hunter, who later gained fame as a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, also participated. Kesey and Hunter each earned $20 $150 in 2012 dollars) every time they took a dose of LSD.

Starting in the early 1960s, Kesey began throwing parties regularly at his home near Stanford. He was given the keys that opened the psychiatrist’s office at Menlo Park, enabling him to “steal” (Kesey’s word) LSD for his parties, where he served “electric chili” laced with LSD to his guests, many of whom were artists and writers. Did the Stanford/Menlo Park CIA program use Kesey in a special project, likely without his complete knowledge, encouraging him to throw parties like those CIA scientist Dr. Harold Abramson held weekly in his Long Island home, and which Leary would start in 1963?12 These parties would expand into ever-larger gatherings that would be dubbed “Acid Tests.” That at least three high level CIA MK-Ultra scientists attended these parties (discussed below) suggests that they were a West Coast version of Timothy Leary’s CIA-attended acid parties at William Mellon Hitchcock’s Millbrook estate. An uncertain number of key people appeared to push Kesey’s and the Merry Pranksters’ LSD promotion. Augustus Owsley Stanley III (best known as Owsley) came from a wealthy and powerful Kentucky “blue blood” family. His father was a government attorney; his grandfather was a governor and then a U.S. Senator from Ken- Owsley Stanley traveled west to attend school briefly at the University of California-Berkeley where at least one writer said he first started a methedrine (amphetamine or “speed”) laboratory. He began manufacturing mass quantities of LSD in 1963. After he paired with Berkeley science prodigy Tim Scully, Scully did the manufacturing. After One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was published, Kesey stopped working at the hospital and started getting acid from Owsley and Scully. They provided a bountiful supply of both LSD and amphetamines to Ken Kesey and often attended his parties.After Kesey wrote his second novel, he decided to do a promotional trip by traveling cross-country on a bus to the World’s Fair being held in Queens, New York, in the summer of 1964. The Pranksters decked out an old school bus with bunk beds and electronic equipment, and painted it in swirling patterns with Day-Glo colors. Scully reportedly set up the stereo and speakers on the bus.16 This might help attract people in black neighborhoods they visited, particularly areas of civil unrest in the South and Harlem just after the riots, to join their party on the bus.

Someone convinced Neal Cassady to join the Pranksters. Cassady was the inspiration for a freewheeling character in Jack Kerouac’s best-selling novel On the Road. Cassady had just served two years at San Quentin prison for possession of a single joint of marajuana.17 While ingesting large amounts of amphetamines, Neal Cassady drove the bus, and many journalists wrote about it. Kesey left his wife to watch their three children in California while he enjoyed the bus trip that was later glorified in music by The Who and the Beatles, with the songs, “Magic Bus” and “Magical Mystery Tour,” respectively. At the start of the trip Kesey stopped to pick up Ken Babbs at the El Toro Marine base where Babbs was completing his term of service.18 A decorated Marine helicopter pilot, one of the first in Vietnam, Babbs had attended the Stanford Writing Program with Kesey in the late 1950s, and they became friends.19 Along with the book On the Bus, a documentary film about the journey, Magic Trip, reported much about this bus trip.20 Though the supposed purpose of the trip was to go to New York, the bus took a long detour south. During the ever-increasing Freedom Summer civil rights campaigns, the bus swung through a number of southern towns bringing loads of acid.21 Evidence indicates they tried to get some of the Freedom Rider activists “tripping.” York comedian Wavy Gravy, whom friends also knew as Hugh Romney.22 The book included a picture of Wavy Gravy’s business card that read “Goon King Brothers Dimensional Kreemo, Rudy Kloptic” (another alias). Wavy Gravy’s Goon King Bros. was a psychotropic-substance delivery service in San Francisco that he started before meeting Kesey’s group. Was this U.S. intelligence work that included Owsley Stanley and Tim Scully? Whether Owsley and Scully knowingly worked for the CIA could never be confirmed, but they would both soon work with the heavily CIA-linked group, William Mellon Hitchcock’s Brotherhood of Eternal Love.23 The Pranksters’ circuitous route took them through Houston, New Orleans, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. They went to segregated beaches and tried to go to black-only swimming areas, acting as if they were well-meaning civil rights movement integrationists. They went to jazz clubs and picked up a jazz artist whom they got to trip with them. Ken Babbs appeared to be leading the troupe’s itinerary by the time they headed for Pensacola, Florida, where Babbs’s Marine buddy had a place. That friend still served, and was in uniform. Babbs apparently still had connections to the military.

Babbs apparently still had connections to the military. Were these harmless connections to the military, or might Babbs have been working as an undercover MK-Ultra agent?24 The bus picked up Babbs’s brother, John, who they said helped orchestrate the trip. John “went missing” and then hitchhiked back to the bus. This happened so many times that others nicknamed him “Sometimes Missing.” With Ken Babbs later-seen propagation of the CIA’s MK-Ultra goals, it’s a wonder if John Babbs was consulting with U.S. intelligence handlers. Police stopped the bus at various times, but always let them go. Ken Babbs would also later talk an inspecting FBI agent out of arresting anyone in his drug-filled home.25 When the bus finally arrived in New York, its first stopping point was not the World’s Fair, but Harlem.26 Residents of Harlem had recently rioted over civil rights issues.27 Promoting acid to rebellious blacks seemed important to the Pranksters, as they would later promote acid to blacks in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles just after the riots there. Eventually the Pranksters did visit the World’s Fair in Queens, New York. There the Pranksters met with Beat writers Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. The gathering, which was filmed, shows Ginsberg and Kerouac happily greeting Cassady, but no one else. Ginsberg reportedly had been having sex with bisexual Neal Cassady off and on for 21 years. Ginsberg, Kerouac and Cassady kept to themselves, separate from the Pranksters. Kerouac didn’t enjoy the group and got Cassady to leave the party early, taking him back to Kerouac’s Massachusetts home.28 Kesey, Ken Babbs, Wavy Gravy and the Merry Pranksters returned to the San Francisco Bay area and continued to promote acid at Kesey’s ranch and beyond. They drove their multi-colored, Day-Glo bus all around Northern California promoting LSD. The timing, coinciding with Freedom Summer, seems more than happenstance. At the nearby UC-Berkeley campus, students were organizing and protesting as part of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Clearly, during two of the biggest leftist mobilizations of students, the civil rights Freedom Summer and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, MK-Ultra-linked LSD promoters worked hard to spread the drug amongst them. U.S. intelligence had already launched FBI Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro) tactics against Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement in the South. The CIA’s Operation Chaos joined the FBI’s Cointelpro targeting. Also, MK-Ultra was extremely active at Stanford University, forty miles south of Berkeley.30 Student accounts of the Free Speech Movement at Cal-Berkeley suggest that certain Pranksters targeted the radical leftists of Berkeley’s campus.

Also, MK-Ultra was extremely active at Stanford University, forty miles south of Berkeley.30 Student accounts of the Free Speech Movement at Cal-Berkeley suggest that certain Pranksters targeted the radical leftists of Berkeley’s campus. For example, Denise Kaufman described how she had just enrolled at Berkeley when she “discovered LSD and the free-speech movement within a few days of each other.”31 Kaufman also told of how one day she was standing in front of Sproul Hall next to tables with information about the Communist party and Socialists. She said she was arrested standing next to Berkeley Free Speech Movement leader Mario Savio. She said that within days she met Ken Kesey and the Pranksters when they had just returned from their cross-country bus trip. Kaufman later became one of the Pranksters.32 Activists invited Kesey to address a large anti-War rally, but he appeared to have been led to play the same role as Timothy Leary, who had a “tune in, turn on and drop out” message. Kesey brought both Pranksters and pro-War Hell’s Angels with him on the bus to that event. When it was Kesey’s turn to speak, he played “Home on the Range” on a harmonica and then asked the crowd: “Do you want to know how to stop the war? Just turn your backs and say fuck it.” He then walked away.33 Kesey and the Pranksters brought many student activists back to their La Honda home for acid parties.34 In Acid Dreams, Lee and Shlain discuss this, stating: “Kesey’s scene was all the rage in the Bay Area. Among others, it attracted people who were involved with the Free Speech Movement that arose on the Berkeley campus of the University of California in the fall of 1964.”35 Police didn’t arrest Kesey for years, either on his drug-raddled bus tour or at his home parties, where distribution of illegal drugs was rampant, and neighbors complained about the noise from Kesey’s loudspeakers blaring in his back yard. In one instance, police cars arrived with red lights flashing but never came in, while the party lasted two days.36 This suggests U.S. intelligence asked the police to hold off. According to On the Bus: “Finally, in April 1965, Kesey and 14 Pranksters were arrested,” at Kesey’s home. Most of the charges were for marijuana possession except for Kesey’s, who was charged with “operating a premises where marijuana was furnished, and with resisting arrest.” Kesey got out on bail and then had over a dozen court appearances before he received a suspended sentence.

After leaving the Marines, Ken Babbs had a business card that read “Ken Babbs, Intrepid Trips, Inc.” Other Pranksters, such as Lee Quarnstrom Intrepid Trips, Inc. On the back of the cards was a picture of Uncle Sam, as seen on WWII recruitment posters, with the legend: “Can YOU Pass the Acid Test?” The Acid Tests were a series of parties where Pranksters served Kool-Aid fruit punch spiked with LSD. Acclaimed writer Tom Wolfe would later write a book about it: The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.37 Bob Weir’s band, performed at the party. Before the end of that year, the band changed its name to the Grateful Dead. A Prankster stated that no one came to their first show but fellow Pranksters.39 This suggests that the Warlocks/Grateful Dead first started playing only for these events. To help make the Acid Tests more alluring, Owsley Stanley and Tim Scully designed advanced sound equipment for the rock group. Rolling Stone magazine said this advanced sound system was the likely reason the Grateful Dead broke out of the San Francisco scene.40 The Warlocks first manager, Hank Harrison, said that an important struggle arose early on regarding influence over the band. Harrison described himself as a student of a leading leftist community organizer named Saul Alinsky. He stood in opposition to the band’s top benefactor, Augustus Owsley Stanley III, who Harrison said was very right-wing. Harrison said that Owsley had teamed up with William Mellon Hitchcock as early as 1964. Billy Hitchcock’s Mellon family, as described earlier, was one of the country’s wealthiest families who held many U.S. intelligence posts. Hitchcock provided unlimited financial and technological resources to the band. In opposition to Owsley, Harrison preached moderation in all drug use. Harrison’s managerial position was cut short in 1965, after six months, and Owsley gained the upper hand in influencing the band. Nonetheless, Harrison continued as a consultant and roommate of longtime Grateful Dead bass player Phil Lesh until 1972. Harrison also described the understated roles of two extremely wealthy women. He said that Owsley’s girlfriend, Melissa Cargill, aided his work. Her family’s Cargill Company had been listed as America’s largest familyowned company. Harrison reported that Cargill was a chemist and that both she and Owsley were taught and continually advised by Professor Alexander “Sasha” Shulgin, who also worked for Dow Chemical Company. Harrison said Shulgin’s “advising” often included hanging out with Owsley on the side or back of the stage at Grateful Dead shows for years.

Harrison said Shulgin’s “advising” often included hanging out with Owsley on the side or back of the stage at Grateful Dead shows for years. Shulgin synthesized and popularized MDMA (ecstasy), as well as the “superpsychedelic” STP for Dow and the MK-Ultra-collaborating U.S. Army Chemical Corps. Harrison added that William Mellon Hitchcock’s sister Peggy helped fund their Brotherhood of Eternal Love acid manufacturing and promotion group. Pranksters held the second Acid Test on December 4, 1965, at a house owned by a black man who lived near San Jose State University. The Pranksters held it the same night as the Rolling Stones concert in San Francisco. They passed out fliers at the Stones’ show asking “Can YOU pass the Acid Test?” and got about 400 people to the party drinking their acidspiked punch. Once again, the Grateful Dead played all night there. Police eventually stopped the music, but no one was arrested.41 The Pranksters and Grateful Dead went on to serve huge bowls of Kool-Aid spiked with LSD to increasingly large numbers of people all over California (and the bowls eventually became trashcans full of “electric” Kool-Aid). Anyone who attended the shows and got thirsty dancing to the band was dosed without fully knowing they would be tripping. The Pranksters and Grateful Dead appeared to target impressionable students and black neighborhoods of unrest, including San Francisco State University and the black Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. As previously mentioned, journalist Hank Albarelli wrote a lengthy book on the history of MK-Ultra, A Terrible Mistake. Albarelli had worked in President Carter’s White House and for the Department of the Treasury. He quoted John Gittinger, a CIA Technical Services Staff scientist with a dozen years at the Agency, who helped organize MK-Ultra’s Human Ecology cover program in universities. Gittinger had even interviewed Dr. Sidney Gotlieb, to screen him for the position of CIA MK-Ultra director.42 MK-Ultra doctor, Gittinger admitted that he and two of his fellow CIA Chemical Division scientists traveled from the East Coast and attended a number of Acid Test parties. Gittinger recalled how at one of these parties, U.S. intelligence “superspy” Alfred “Hubbard and some doctor … two bald-headed, portly guys in dark suits walking into the middle of all this madness … people began melting away from them … At least when we went to these things we made an effort to blend in with things.” The “effort to blend in” suggests that Gittinger and his colleagues were spying on the events.

Did these high level CIA scientists spend this large amount of time traveling to the West Coast because they helped orchestrate these Acid Tests?43 Meanwhile, anti-War activists increased their organizing on the West Coast. On a weekend in mid-October of 1965, 14,000 protesters marched on the Oakland Army induction center. Writers called it the first major San Francisco Bay area anti-Vietnam War demonstration. The police turned protesting marchers away the first day, and Hell’s Angels turned the marchers away the second day. At the end of the second day of action at the induction center, many protesters were lured to a Longshoreman’s Hall. The Longshoremen are a particularly radical labor union. Overall, 400- 1,200 people came to the Hall for “the birth of a scene,” with a group of rock bands and psychedelic lights.44 After a third Acid Test with about 300 people on Muir Beach near San Francisco, Ken Kesey stated that the Acid Tests were over, as he wasn’t time for possession of marijuana.45 Several nights after Kesey’s arrest, Ken Babbs, Stewart Brand and others held an even bigger Acid Test. Babbs and Brand had spent considerable time organizing a three-night event they called the “Trips Festival,” which was a major step up from the former Acid Tests. It was held at the Longshoremen’s Hall.46 Stewart Brand reported a particularly interesting military history. In one interview, Brand said he, like Babbs, was in the military ROTC at Stanford from 1960-62, and “taught Basic Training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. I did serve half a year at the Pentagon as the Army’s senior photographer.” In another interview, which is also on film, Brand added that at Fort Dix, “I was running basic training as a Second Lieutenant there. And then my weekends were in the Lower East Side in New York hanging out with artists … messing with psychedelic drugs.” Brand further said that “with the Merry Pranksters … there were a number of ex-military people … [including Kesey’s] number two, Ken Babbs … that gave us a common language and a set of understandings.”47 Journalist Hank Albarelli reprinted CIA MK-Ultra scientist John Gittinger’s report that he and at least two of his colleagues attended the Trips Festival. Researchers Lee and Shlain noted that the Trips Festival was three days long and included advanced technology for its time, such as closed circuit television cameras set up all over, so people could see themselves dancing.

Researchers Lee and Shlain noted that the Trips Festival was three days long and included advanced technology for its time, such as closed circuit television cameras set up all over, so people could see themselves dancing. Grateful Dead lead guitarist Jerry Garcia said there were several thousand attendees each day. Music promoter Bill Graham described acid everywhere. “They had ices spiked with acid, available to all, children as well. There were big tubs on the balcony and downstairs.”48 Ken Kesey’s first marijuana arrest had resulted in probation with a three-year jail sentence hanging over his head if arrested again.49 Friends bailed Kesey out after his second marijuana arrest, and he fled the country for Mexico. Sources stated: “with Kesey in Mexico, Babbs was the man in charge. He took the bus to Los Angeles for a series of Acid Tests. With the help of Wavy Gravy, the Pranksters put on four Acid Tests.”50 Besides holding a test in a Unitarian Church, the Los Angeles Acid Tests notably included one in a garage in the black Watts area, just after one of the largest riots in American history.51 Was it more than coincidence that Ken Babbs and his tripped-out, easily led Pranksters tried to push acid at the two locations of the nation’s first two major black riots, Harlem on the bus trip, and Watts? With the Grateful Dead playing, the Watts Acid Test dosed many without their knowledge. After people got heated up dancing, they drank from one of the several 30-gallon drums of Kool-Aid fruit punch. People received massive doses of acid in that punch. Someone purportedly miscalculated the right amount of Kool-Aid for a normal trip and people who followed the instructions got six hits of LSD per cup instead of one.52 Wavy Gravy described the scene: “People would be dancing for about three hours to the Grateful Dead, and then they’d be looking for something wet. Well, ‘wet’ was about 300 micrograms a swallow. That was pretty intense for some people, but if they wanted to go outside, there was nowhere to go because Watts was still smoldering from the riots.”53 Along with the CIA’s MK-Ultra scientists, local police and state narcotics agents also attended the events that appeared to be larger humanguinea-pig experiments.

Magazines such as Look, The Reporter, Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening Post, and The Ladies Home Journal followed suit.56 By the early fall of 1966, Ken Kesey, now a fugitive, planned an Acid Test Graduation at another Trips Festival. He planned to pop up on stage and tell people to go “beyond acid,” then climb through a ceiling escape door and be whisked away by helicopter. However, police arrested Kesey shortly before the event. Authorities apparently didn’t want a counterculture, rebel role model changing his mind and preaching against acid use.57 Kesey eventually made the Acid Test Graduation event happen when he got out of jail, though pictures showed that between three to six dozen people participated.58 Shortly after, a court sentenced Kesey to a prison work farm, followed by a three-year house arrest at his brother’s farm in Oregon that definitively ended his “acid graduation” message.59 Ken Kesey said that by 1969, sixty-one people lived with him in a barn in Oregon. He said they all went to Woodstock without him that year when he found a candle burnt down just before it could catch the surrounding hay on fire. He kicked most of them out after that. Years later, Allen Ginsberg got the CIA records stating that the CIA was paying for those acid experiments to “try to make people insane—to weaken people and put them under the control of interrogators.” Kesey said he thought the CIA didn’t want to have Notes 1 Kenneth Cloke, A Brief History of Civil Liberties Protest Movements in Berkeley – From TASC to SLATE to FSM (1957-1965) (Santa Monica, CA: CDR Press,1994) pp .20-27. 2 See, for example, Lisa Pearl Rosenbaum, “The Honorable Scars of the McCarthy Era,” book review of A Granddaughters Rite of Passage: Tales from the McCarthy Era, printed in Tikkun, 1/25/11; http://www.tikkun.org/tikkundaily/2011/01/25/the-honorable-scars-of-the-mccarthy-era/. 3 These details come from various sources, including a viewing of the film Operation Abolition (1960), Dir.

Evidence supports the contention that the wealthiest oligarchs who influenced U.S. intelligence had opponents assassinated when necessary. In Vietnam, the American oligarchs saw a chance to gain more control over the opium cash crops that their families had a history of trafficking. Besides the obvious profit motive from opium trafficking, a little-known vast profit incentive also came from laundering drug profits. Also, with blacks increasingly rioting over civil rights in the 1960s, the oligarchy would have had the added motive of sedating and dividing poor black communities with heroin, the way their progenitors had conducted the Opium Wars on China, as discussed earlier. Over a five-year period in the 1960s, gunmen assassinated the four most influential opponents of the Vietnam War: President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The oligarchy had the top motive and means for these assassinations. Other books have explored detailed evidence regarding U.S. intelligence’s possible assassinations of JFK, Malcolm X, MLK and RFK on behalf of the oligarchs.1 The oligarchy’s motive for assassinating the Kennedys deserves a new look with respect to both the Vietnam War and MK-Ultra.

Activists fought tirelessly for African Americans’ civil rights, and their small but increasing successes began occurring from the late 1950s sociologists Frances Piven and Richard Cloward make a strong case that riots and other forms of mass disruption had the biggest influence on leading the ruling powers to pass civil rights legislation. While Malcolm X (El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz) and MLK didn’t start the riots, U. S. intelligence’s research indicated that the rioters had the most respect for these two leaders, who arguably raised their awareness of oppression as a reason to riot.2 While the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations enacted civil rights legislation, U.S. intelligence appeared to increase the distribution of heroin into black neighborhoods of American cities to help stop the riots. The wave of heroin that flooded into pockets of unrest in the 1960s served as a tool of oppression against activists and the rioters. Not only did it addict thousands and ruin their lives, it also sidetracked civil rights activists who became wary of entering poor black communities due to the vast increase in violence caused by the drug influx and fights over drug turf. Lyndon Johnson’s Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, would later say that he believed “the government uses drugs to sedate and divide the masses.”3 A former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Housing and Wall Street insider, Catherine Austin Fitts, explained a little-known aspect of illicit drugs’ huge effect on the U.S. stock market. Fitts, who worked in the first President Bush’s administration, had a high-level background on Wall Street. She was managing director and a member of the board of directors of Dillon Read & Co, considered one of the “Wall Street dynasties.” She was also former president of The Hamilton Securities Group and later started The Solari Group, Inc.4 Fitts revealed that the CIA and Department of Justice admitted to creating “a memorandum of understanding that permitted the CIA to help its allies and assets to traffic in drugs and not have to report it.” She stated that the U.S. competed with other countries in how best to accumulate cash immediately after World War II. Top researchers agree that the CIA used military transport airline Air America, as well as other airlines, to help traffic Golden Triangle opium worldwide over the following decades.5 Fitts referred to money made from illicit drug sales as “narco dollars.” She said, “The power of narco dollars comes when you combine drug trafficking with the stock market,” detailing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:88:61a1844ab08d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3373, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "report it.” She stated that the U.S. competed with other countries in how best to accumulate cash immediately after World War II. Top researchers agree that the CIA used military transport airline Air America, as well as other airlines, to help traffic Golden Triangle opium worldwide over the following decades.5 Fitts referred to money made from illicit drug sales as “narco dollars.” She said, “The power of narco dollars comes when you combine drug trafficking with the stock market,” detailing how narco dollars exponentially increase the value of a company’s stock. She continued, “The ‘POP’ is a word I learned on Wall Street to describe the multiple of income at which a stock trades. If a stock like PepsiCo trades at 20 times its income, that means for every $100, 000 of income it makes, its stock [total market capitalization] goes up $2 million. The people who own the company and all sizes of investors make money from the stocks going up.” Fitts added that banks also make huge money from cash influxes, in lending it with compounded interest. For example, if someone gets a $120, 000 home mortgage loan at 4.5% interest over 30 years, they actually end up paying the bank over $218, 000 by the end of the loan term. Through these types of loans, as well as credit card loans, banks gain huge economic power.6 According to Fitts, banks and many other companies “launder” money from drug sales in their company’s income to increase their stock market value. Laundering means taking the cash from drug dealers and listing it in their income reports. She said that restaurants and other companies dealing in cash also launder drug money. These restaurants and banks take money from the drug dealers and get a percentage of it before giving it back to the dealers as “clean” money. They easily hide these transactions in their accounting books. With a plausible 20-times increase in the stock value of the company that owns the restaurant, it’s easy to return the money to the drug dealer in other ways that launders it of its source from the illegal drug trade, and hides it from the Internal Revenue Service.7 Global sources have documented the ever-increasing amount of money laundered over the last half century. These sources include Antonio Maria Costas, the head of the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.8 The Washington Post would later report an admission by the CIA’s own Inspector General that the CIA has trafficked drugs, as will be discussed.9 ohn F. Kennedy started his presidency with a conservative pledge to build more missiles in the wake of of his “missile gap” campaign. Later in his term he promoted more liberal policies including his evolving position on nuclear arms, in signing the first Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union’s Nikita Khrushchev.10 Of key importance, Kennedy also called for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:89:f4929e671cf8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3374, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "later report an admission by the CIA’s own Inspector General that the CIA has trafficked drugs, as will be discussed.9 ohn F.

Later in his term he promoted more liberal policies including his evolving position on nuclear arms, in signing the first Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union’s Nikita Khrushchev.10 Of key importance, Kennedy also called for a pullback of all troops from Vietnam. Researchers have shown strong proof of JFK’s decision to pull out of Vietnam. For example, researcher John Judge’s mother worked for the government department that published the data on future troops assigned for deployment in Vietnam for the following years. In 1963, her publication reported zero troops for the coming year, as the pullout was supposed to be final in 1964. Also, University of Texas Prof. James Galbraith, son of a Kennedy advisor, stated on a British news show that the historical record includes official position statements and tapes documenting that Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense, Robert MacNamara, had made the formal decision by October of 1963 to pull all troops out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.11 When President Kennedy took office, he fired CIA Director Allen Dulles and appointed John McCone as CIA Director. Dulles, a former lawyer for the Rockefellers, had championed the MK-Ultra program and McCone ended the program. Richard Helms, the CIA’s Deputy Director for Covert Operations, who was second in command under Dulles, took matters into his own hands and ran MK-Ultra behind McCone’s and Kennedy’s backs. But in 1963, CIA inspector general John Earman accidentally stumbled upon the MK-Ultra project. McCone tried unsuccessfully to defund the program, but Richard Helms continued it until at least 1973.12 With Kennedy’s presidency cut short on November 22, 1963, he had little time to stop the programs of Helms and others still loyal to Allen Dulles and the Rockefeller-Harriman-Morgan oligarchy. It seems Helms first tried to get to Kennedy with MK-Ultra doctors. Lee and Shlain state that Max “Dr. Feelgood” Jacobson, MD, regularly visited Timothy Leary’s headquarters on William Mellon Hitchcock’s Millbrook estate, where he worked with known MK-Ultra operatives, such as psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond.

President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, were developing legal cases against New Orleans Mafia boss, Carlos Marcello, as well as Florida Mafia boss Santos Trafficante Jr., Chicago boss Sam Giancana, and mobster Johnny Roselli. Professor Alfred McCoy documented how Trafficante had taken over the work of top New York mobsters, Meyer Lansky and Charles “Lucky” Luciano, who worked with US intelligence in heroin trafficking. Professor Peter Dale Scott documented Marcello’s narcotics smuggling from Latin American countries with U.S. intelligence support.14 at least been working with the CIA to assassinate Castro, which Robert F. Kennedy tried to stop: “recently released RFK files” showed that he “put a stop to what he considered an insane initiative by the CIA to subcontract out the job to American gangsters.” Yet “those efforts continued, but with different mobsters, and out of view of the Attorney General. Other recently released files also confirm that Marcello, Trafficante, Giancana, and Rosselli were all involved, at varying levels, in the CIA-Mafia plots to get Castro.”15 New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison was made famous in Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, based on Garrison’s book On the Trail of the Assassins. In reviewing that book, the New York Times summarized Garrison’s analysis: “the C.I.A., motivated by disgust with Kennedy’s withholding of air cover during the Bay of Pigs invasion [of Cuba] and his reported decision to withdraw troops from Vietnam, executed Kennedy in a coup d’etat.” The aforementioned Boston Globe article also stated that one week after JFK’s assassination, Robert Kennedy sent loyalist William Walton to Moscow to tell Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev of his belief that “domestic hardliners, rather than foreign agents, were responsible.” Here RFK was referring to right-wing oligarchs, the CIA and anti-Castro Mafia. Government documents included Marcello’s eventual confession to his involvement. The Boston Globe said that a 1975 Senate “subcommittee was the first offical body to openly question the lone-gunman narrative,” calling Giancana and Rosselli to appear before it. Each was murdered before he could give testimony. In addition, researchers Ed Haslam and Judith Vary Baker presented ample evidence that she worked with accused JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie on a U.S. intelligence project while Ferrie and Oswald were also working for Marcello’s crime ring.16 President Kennedy continued on his path against the desires of the oligarchy and his generals’ advice, and many argue that his presidency was cut short by that opposition.

For example, James Douglas’s highly regarded JFK and the Unspeakable highlights Kennedy’s decision to pull out of Vietnam as a major reason for his assassination. UC-Berkeley Professor Peter Dale Scott’s Deep Politics and the Death of JFK specifically posits that Kennedy’s imminent withdrawal of the U.S. military from Vietnam was a threat to Americancoordinated international drug-trafficking forces, and the primary reason for his assassination. In Deep Politics, Scott revealed that organized crime aided the CIA and America’s notorious drug-trafficking families, who were concerned about losing their huge profits, in orchestrating Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas.17 Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two of black America’s most important leaders in the 1960s. Internationally, Malcolm X had commented that African independence leaders had developed socialist policies. These leaders formed a group they called the Organization of African Unity. Malcolm X was the only American allowed in their meetings.1 1 Malcolm X had split with the Nation of Islam (NOI) by 1964.19 Malcolm formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity based in New York to expand his work for civil rights and social justice to non-religious and non-black activists who weren’t part of the NOI. Malcolm X maintained his position of militant self-defense while he began directly collaborating with Martin Luther King’s group and other civil rights movement leaders.20 Malcolm X had an impact on the American oligarchy and U.S. intelligence’s use of drugs as political weapons in two ways. First, Malcolm X helped develop a very effective addiction treatment and peer support program in the Nation of Islam, which he described in The Autobiography of Malcolm X. 21 Malcolm X did not allow drug use among his group’s members and he helped influence others against drug use. Secondly, according to the late Columbia University professor Manning Marable, Malcolm X was the first prominent African-American leader, and arguably the first American leader, to oppose the Vietnam War.22 Gunmen assassinated Malcolm X (then calling himself El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz) on February 21, 1965. An FBI memorandum of March 1968 discussed their long-range goals. These included the goal to: “Prevent the rise of a ‘messiah’ who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement. Malcolm X might have been such a messiah. He is the martyr of the movement today. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael and Elijah Muhammed all aspire to this position. Elijah Muhammed is less of a threat because of his age. King could be a very real contender for this position should he abandon his supposed ‘obedience’ to ‘white liberal doctrines’ (nonviolence).”23 This", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:92:19a8e73ab23e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3377, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "goal to: “Prevent the rise of a ‘messiah’ who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.

Elijah Muhammed is less of a threat because of his age. King could be a very real contender for this position should he abandon his supposed ‘obedience’ to ‘white liberal doctrines’ (nonviolence).”23 This and other documents show how Malcolm X had clearly emerged as U.S. intelligence’s top threat.24 Martin Luther King Jr. won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 after close to a decade of non-violent civil rights organizing, during which he spearheaded many marches and rallies to end segregation and gain voting rights denied to many poor blacks in the American South.25 Later, according to CIA documents and FBI agents, the government’s goal was to destroy the increasingly radical King, who had grown more complacent about blacks’ riotous responses to injustice, saying, “A riot is the language of the unheard.” The CIA made MLK their number-one black activist target.26 William Pepper worked as a journalist in Vietnam, an experience that led to anti-War activism beside King, and the two once tried to start a new political party together. Almost thirty years later, William Pepper published a book, Orders to Kill (and later Act of State), about his investigation of MLK’s assassination, detailing U.S. intelligence documents, government whistleblowers, and other evidence supporting the suspicion that the oligarchy had U.S. intelligence assassinate Martin Luther King. By that time, King’s sons and daughters had grown up to become accomplished leaders in their own right.27 In his introduction to Orders to Kill’s 1998 edition, MLK’s son, Dexter Scott King, said U.S. intelligence orchestrated the assassination of his father in 1968 for several reasons. Their primary motive was to stop MLK’s civil rights work and anti-Vietnam war organizing. The exhaustive evidence regarding this motive included the fact that U.S. intelligence orchestrated MLK’s assassination on the exact one-year anniversary of his first official speech against the Vietnam War at New York’s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967. They appeared to want to send a message against anti-War organizing. This magnifies the importance of the war to control the Golden Triangle opium-cultivating region.28 Pepper and others found government-documented evidence that a dozen government intelligence agencies coordinated their plotting against King before his death. Many witnesses and much evidence support how they worked with police and contracted with the Mafia to aid the fatal shooting of MLK in Memphis.29 MLK’s widow Coretta Scott King and their children had William Pepper, who had become an attorney, represent them in a lawsuit, partly to help publicize Pepper’s findings.

The King family filed a lawsuit against Lloyd Jowers and his government intelligence co-conspirators in MLK’s assassination. Jowers owned the boarding house from where the assassin’s shots reportedly came. The suit came to trial in 1999, and the King family won their case in court. The King family placed the entire trial transcript on the King Center’s website.30 The Mafia figures U.S. intelligence contracted to aid this assassination were steeped in drug trafficking. Myron Billet told a U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Assassinations that in January of 1968 he witnessed several CIA and FBI agents offer the heads of New York’s top Mafia families $1 million to aid in the assassination of MLK. The New York Mafia rejected the offer. Carlos Marcello’s New Orleans crime family accepted it. Carlos Marcello trafficked vast amounts of morphine and cocaine into the U.S. His Memphis crime associate Frank Liberto, who aided more directly in the operation, was also reportedly involved in drug trafficking.31 Ross MacLean, a Canadian psychiatrist who worked at Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver, collaborated with federal agent and acid Kennedy’s wife Ethel with LSD-assisted therapy in 1965. Robert Kennedy had moved to an increasingly leftist political agenda, particularly after his brother’s assassination. The targeting of his wife for LSD therapy by the Canadian MK-Ultra psychiatrist parallels the targeting of Jewish leftist Canadian politician David Orlikov’s wife, Val, by MK-Ultra psychiatrist Ewen Cameron. Unlike Ethel Kennedy, Val Orlikov’s situation received long-term “treatment” that included high-dose shock treatment causing severe long-term damage to her mind.32 Robert Kennedy apparently saw some good in his wife’s treatment. Given subsequent evidence of how MK-Ultra likely helped orchestrate RFK’s assassination, it is ironic that RFK first defended LSD. Kennedy interrogated government psychiatrists and stated, “Perhaps we have lost sight of the fact that [LSD] can be very, very helpful in our society if used properly.”33 CIA representatives hid from Kennedy their research results on thousands of soldiers at Edgewood Arsenal from 1955-1975, showing that LSD had caused lasting damage in many of their research subjects.34 By 1968, U.S. intelligence considered Robert Kennedy a serious risk to the interests of the ruling oligarchy who wanted to win the Vietnam War and gain control over the opium-producing poppy fields. As early as February of 1966, then-Senator Kennedy publicly broke with the administration of President Lyndon Johnson in calling for settlement of the Vietnam War. By 1968, especially after the Tet Offensive of the North Vietnamese, many said that RFK stood fully against the Vietnam War.35 Martin Luther King family attorney William Pepper", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:94:9ec0b3ef8dd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3379, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 95, "text": "Robert Kennedy a serious risk to the interests of the ruling oligarchy who wanted to win the Vietnam War and gain control over the opium-producing poppy fields.

By 1968, especially after the Tet Offensive of the North Vietnamese, many said that RFK stood fully against the Vietnam War.35 Martin Luther King family attorney William Pepper said Robert Kennedy also made overtures to staunchly antiwar MLK to become his Vice-Presidential candidate if RFK won in the primaries.36 Bullets took the life of Robert F. Kennedy on June 6, 1968. By the end of March of that year, the sitting president, Democrat Lyndon Johnson, had announced he would not run for re-election. On the night of June 6, RFK had just won the California presidential primary, the country’s largest, and most expected him to go on to win the presidency. After giving a victory speech to a large crowd in a California hotel, RFK was led out through a kitchen pantry, where he was assassinated. The Los Angeles Police Department investigative report on the RFK assassination stated Sirhan Sirhan, alone, fired eight shots in that pantry and killed the presidential candidate, before being wrestled to the ground by Kennedy’s security. A mass of evidence contradicts this. Los Angeles coroner Thomas Noguchi administered the autopsy. Understanding the gravity of the case, he invited national expert coroners to oversee his work. Noguchi declared that all three of the bullets striking Kennedy entered from the rear, in a flight path from down to up and right to left. Powder burns around the entry wound indicated the fatal bullet was fired from less than one inch from the head and no more than two to three inches behind the right ear. A photograph showed Noguchi at a press conference shaping his hand into a gun within an inch of his head to show from where the assassin must have shot.37 Also, the Los Angeles Police Department’s Rampart Division had multiple photographs of the shooting they hid from public view and eventually “lost.”39 William Harper, a criminologist with 35 years of experience that included U.S. intelligence work, was brought in to examine the evidence by Sirhan’s defense attorneys. Harper testified in court and wrote a long affidavit supporting the coroner Noguchi and other witnesses’ accounts that someone else fired a gun from behind RFK and within an inch of him. Harper also found that the bullets fired did not match Sirhan’s gun and, in fact, had come from two different guns.40 LAPD radio logs, eyewitnesses and media groups reported sightings of fleeing suspects other than Sirhan Sirhan, who was held at the scene.41 One pair of researchers who investigated RFK’s assassination, William Turner and Jonn Christian, had strong journalistic credentials along with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:95:cac909b3914e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3380, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "other witnesses’ accounts that someone else fired a gun from behind RFK and within an inch of him.

Turner worked for ten years as an FBI agent before writing for high-circulation magazines. He also published two books on the FBI. Christian had served as a Navy airman and then worked as a broadcast newsman for ABC until 1966. Their book, The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy: The Conspiracy and Coverup, was the first to state that the CIA assassinated RFK. Turner and Christian claimed U.S. intelligence used hypnosis and drugs to produce the mental state that led Sirhan Sirhan to fire a gun at Robert Kennedy.42 The CIA history of research that started as Operation Artichoke and developed into Operation MK-Ultra found success with hypnosis and drugs in the early 1950s. CIA documents dated 11/26/51 and 6/8/54 support this. The documents noted that the CIA scientists used heavy “amounts of scopolamine.” Former Carter White House staffer-turned-journalist, H.P. Albarelli Jr., reported on two ultra-secret CIA behavior modification and hypnosis programs initially called ZR/ALERT and ZR/AWAKE, “creating hypnotically-controlled operatives to carry out Agency-directed tasks.”43 Two more researchers agreeing with Turner and Christian’s findings included Probe magazine editors James DiEugenio and Lisa Pease, who perused thousands of government documents from the RFK assassination records released.44 These documents and interviews informed their conclusion that Sirhan Sirhan was a hypnotized patsy. Official agencys have ignored these findings. DiEugenio and Pease also cited top eyewitness, CBS News employee Donald Schulman, who told radio reporter Jeff Brant that after Sirhan started firing, “a Caucasian gentleman stepped out and fired three times; the security guard hit Kennedy all three times.” His and similar statements were confirmed in a related 1975 court hearing. The guard standing in that position just to the right and behind RFK was Thane Eugene Cesar. Cesar admitted pulling a gun out. The LAPD never tested his gun to see if it was fired. Cesar worked for Ace Guard Services. It’s telling that LAPD criminalist DeWayne Wolfer, who may have helped cover up evidence concerning RFK’s assassination, became president of Ace some years later.45 Another researcher, Shane O’Sullivan, originally produced the 2007 documentary RFK Must Die: The Assassination of Bobby Kennedy for BBC Newsnight. RFK Must Die presented evidence in agreement with the main points of these other researchers. The O’Sullivan documentary showed an interview with world-renowned hypnosis expert Dr. Herbert Speigel of Columbia University Medical School.

The O’Sullivan documentary showed an interview with world-renowned hypnosis expert Dr. Herbert Speigel of Columbia University Medical School. Dr. Spiegel testified in court that Sirhan Sirhan was among the 5 ⋅ 10% of people found to be highly hypnotizable.46 Martin Luther King family attorney William Pepper eventually took on the Sirhan case and hired a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist, hypnosis expert Daniel Brown, to spend sixty hours interviewing Sirhan. The Associated Press said Professor Brown found Sirhan remembered being led by an attractive woman in a polka dot dress who pinched him. Pepper’s court filings state someone placed Sirhan under hypnosis with the aid of drugs, so that the pinch caused him to realize he had a gun and to start firing it, thinking he was at a shooting range. Only under hypnosis did Sirhan remember seeing another gun fire shots and other details of what happened at RFK’s assassination.47 Turner and Christian cited the FBI summary report that included interviews of seven witnesses who claim seeing the woman in the polka dot dress flee the scene, along with a man believed to be another shooter. Eyewitnesses Sandy Serrano and a couple identified as “the Bernsteins” gave interviews to police officer Sergeant Paul Sharaga stating that the woman in the polka dot dress exclaimed, “We shot him—we shot him!” Serrano asked, “Who did you shoot?” The woman replied, “Senator Kennedy.” This bizarre pronouncement suggests that the fleeing woman was also under hypnosis. Furthermore, the multiple shooters would explain why six people were shot at the scene of Kennedy’s assassination.48 And finally, a British Broadcast Corporation televised news report linked with Shane O’Sullivan’s work presented several former CIA associates identifying three senior CIA agents at the Los Angeles hotel where RFK was assassinated. The BBC said these operatives had no authority inside the U.S.; they were supposed to be in Vietnam at the time. But one of these CIA operatives, David Morales, admitted to friends: “I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch, and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.”49 Notes 1 William F.

Some say that the Soviet’s military helped Leonid Brezhnev depose Khrushchev within a year. Few Americans knew of Kennedy’s back-channel mail correspondence with the Soviet Union’s leader, Nikita Khrushchev. When Kennedy made a special appeal to Khrushchev for help regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet leader complied and turned his missiles around. Both leaders struggled against their militaries, and Kennedy paid Khrushchev back with a famous speech at American University in 1963, announcing an end to the Cold War with the Soviet Union. It was the only American presidential speech the Soviets printed in full on the front page of their national newspaper. Few American mainstream media outlets covered this monumental speech.

Researchers documented a nationwide series of riots after police brutalized black leaders at some of the peaceful demonstrations. The largest of the riots were in New York, Chicago, Maryland, Philadelphia and New Jersey in the first half of 1964. Whether primarily responding to riots or sincere about civil rights, President John F. Kennedy initiated the Civil Rights Act just before his assassination in November of 1963. This took away many barriers to southern blacks voting. Congress passed the Act and President Johnson signed it in July of 1964.

Enyart said he continued taking photos during the shooting. The LAPD confiscated Enyart’s film and failed to ever release the evidence to the public.

A top CIA-connected think tank, the Rand Corporation, headquartered in Santa Monica, California, “played a crucial role in designing strategies for counter-revolution and pacification” both in Vietnam and against anti-War Americans. A 1962 Rand report revealed that LSD could lead those in left-wing organizations to “resign or become inactive.”2 Evidence shows that the CIA’s MK-Ultra operations first dosed various leaders in politics and the arts, then had their media assets spotlight these leaders in a sophisticated way to make them well-known counterculture figures. They often coupled them with undercover agents in propaganda campaigns to promote LSD to leftists. In February of 1965, President Lyndon Johnson initiated Operation Flaming Dart, a major expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. It included the bombing of North Vietnam as well as the first use of U.S. ground troops to fight the Viet Cong in South Vietnam.3 The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at the University of Michigan held the first anti-War teach-in, and other SDS chapters began to follow suit. In October of 1965, UC-Berkeley students, led by Free Speech veteran organizers including Jerry Rubin and Mike Rossman, held one of the nation’s largest events—an all day teach-in to protest the Vietnam War.

In October of 1965, UC-Berkeley students, led by Free Speech veteran organizers including Jerry Rubin and Mike Rossman, held one of the nation’s largest events—an all day teach-in to protest the Vietnam War. Throughout the next fourteen months, Berkeley activists recruited more and more anti-War protesters for rallies and campus strikes.4 Berkeley students inspired other student actions nationwide. Many students joined SDS. By October of 1965, SDS had grown into a massive organization of leftest students with 10,000 members and chapters in 89 schools. By the end of that school year it added 5,000 more members and nearly doubled its chapters to 172 schools.5 The psychological handling of writer Ken Kesey to lead youth to acid went astray when Kesey urged people to “graduate” from LSD. By the end of 1966, Kesey, seen as the figurehead of the Acid Tests, moved from California and the UC Berkeley area to Oregon. Ken Babbs and other Pranksters moved with Kesey. They eventually changed Kesey’s mind about stopping acid and urging others to stop using it. They also would promote acid in their Day-Glo bus at events such as Woodstock.6 While some of the Pranksters moved with him, a few key people involved in the Acid Tests stayed in the San Francisco Bay Area. These included top LSD trafficker Owsley Stanley and chemist Tim Scully. Within a year, these two and their cohorts had vastly expanded the size of the Acid Tests. While Owsley had manufactured a lot of acid before the mid-1960s, with Scully he set up a larger LSD laboratory in Richmond, California in the spring of 1966. Top MK-Ultra scientists attended Owsley’s Acid Test parties. Also, former Grateful Dead manager/advisor Hank Harrison said Owsley and Scully worked with William Mellon Hitchcock by 1965. This and other evidence suggests that Owsley was working undercover for the CIA in helping set up the Acid Tests as LSD promotion events for MK-Ultra in a way that would make LSD production appear as a “grassroots phenomenon.”7 Owsley had a network of acid dealers who helped expand San Francisco’s LSD scene.

Cooke had a close relationship with his sister and brother-in-law, Alice and Roger Kent, the latter a major figure in the California Democratic Party. Cooke also regularly partied with Roger’s brother, Sherman Kent. Researchers Lee and Shlain said Sherman Kent headed the “CIA’s National Board of Estimates (a powerful position), and served as CIA director Allen Dulles’s right-hand man during the Cold War.” Cooke also “made the acquaintance of a number of CIA operatives while traveling in Europe.”9 Cooke’s governmental connections were legion. During the ’60s, Cooke worked out of Mexico where he met with researcher Andrija Puharich, who ran “parapsychology and drug experiments for the U.S. military in the late 1950s, and Seymoure Lazare, a wealthy business associate of William Mellon Hitchcock.” Cooke’s funding sources were unknown, but they were lavish, affording him the ability to send off six of his Psychedelic Rangers to “various psychedelic hotspots in North America and Europe.”10 The Psychedelic Rangers carried out MK-Ultra-type operations, following Cooke’s directions to damage leftists with LSD. Lee and Shlain described how, “Following Cooke’s master plan, the Psychedelic Rangers targeted selected individuals for high-dose LSD initiations.” One Psychedelic Ranger, Michael Bowen, claimed “he furnished acid to a number of well-known figures, including comedian Dick Gregory.” Gregory was the nation’s most popular black comedian and an ardent civil rights activist. Other intelligence agents convinced top jazz musician Charles Mingus to try acid.11 In 1966, Cooke sent Michael Bowen to settle in Haight-Ashbury, and the two maintained constant communication. Bowen helped start a psychedelic newspaper, The Oracle, in San Francisco around the time of the Berkeley activism. Bowen had Oracle organizers at his house where they set up Acid Test type events—a Love Pageant Rally in 1966 and then, the first Human Be-In. They dubbed it a “Pow Wow, Gathering of Tribes.” Michael Bowen and The Oracle reportedly held the Human Be-In in January of 1967 in order to “psychedelicize” the radical political left. If William S. Burroughs and a number of research articles are correct, they sought to do the CIA’s bidding in making the radical left less competent.12 With Kesey and his Pranksters gone, The Oracle staff members and others, such as members of the Grateful Dead, took over the organizing of these massively expanded Acid Tests. Timothy Leary preached his acidworshipping philosophy, while Michael Bowen and his Oracle organizers invited key leftist leaders, including Berkeley Vietnam Day organizer Jerry Rubin, comedian Dick Gregory, and socialist Beat poet Allen Ginsberg for the Human Be-In.13 As Lee and Shlain described, Michael Bowen and his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:107:c133e8e939b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3392, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 108, "text": "the radical left less competent.12 With Kesey and his Pranksters gone, The Oracle staff members and others, such as members of the Grateful Dead, took over the organizing of these massively expanded Acid Tests.

By the mid-1960s, as student activism increased nationwide, Leary traveled the country urging young folks to “turn on, tune in, and drop out.” Here Leary meant dropping out of society, including dropping activism. Oracle editor Ron Thelin repeated Leary in summarizing the paper’s editorial slant. He said it was “to show that LSD provides a profound experience.… To get everyone to turn on, tune in, and drop out.”15 With undercover agents throughout the San Francisco Bay area and other cities, U.S. intelligence could heighten their LSD promotion propaganda operations in another important way. Journalists John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton wrote a book about the public relations industry that reported how major public relations firms created “astroturf,” manufacturing fake grassroots groups and propaganda to make their messages appear to come from passionate individuals, rather than huge wealthy institutions. The whole LSD and other drug movement, from Owsley and Bowen in San Francisco, to suspected agents in the East Village neighborhood of New York City, and even the Psychedelic Rangers’ European “psychedelic hotspots,” appeared to be part of this astroturf network.16 The organizers had Hell’s Angels bikers working security at the Be-In— the same Hell’s Angels who fought against activists marching in protest of the Vietnam War. Biker gangs’ history shows a large percentage of membership is ex-military. Hell’s Angels also did contract work for U.S. intelligence.18 Descriptions of the event reported that only Jerry Rubin and Allan Ginsberg talked about protesting the Vietnam War, and they were largely ignored. The Human Be-In created an overriding theme around the false myth of “expanding consciousness.” Leary and others pushed the myth that eating acid had this desirable effect. A high percentage of the crowd of over 25,000 men, women and children were initiated into taking LSD at that event, including activists drawn in by anti-War speakers like Rubin.20 Timothy Leary continued his refrain after the event.

In a press conference with philosopher Allan Watts and writers Allan Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, Leary presented himself as a perfect spokesman for those trying to suppress anti-War activists. Leary said, “The choice is between being rebellious and being religious. Don’t vote. Don’t politic. Don’t petition. You can’t do anything about America politically.” He criticized student activists as “young men with menopausal minds,” if they didn’t focus primarily on “expanding their consciousness” with psychedelics.21 After this Be-In, organizers held similar events in Chicago, New York and other locations. While actual numbers are hard to determine, attendees remember a hundred Be-Ins held across the country. SDS had mobilized student activists around the Berkeley-inspired anti-Vietnam War protests on numerous college campuses. In seeming reaction, U.S. intelligencelinked LSD promoters used vast resources to duplicate their acid promotion at Be-Ins and other huge events nationwide.22 By 1966, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) had cast out whites and took on the new name, Student National Seale started the Black Panther Party for Self Defense in Oakland. In the spring of 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. broke with other traditional black leaders in announcing his opposition to the Vietnam War. At the same time, young people began to move politically more to the radical left. In the black community many were radicalized by Malcolm X’s death. 23 Race riots broke out nationwide, especially in the northern black communities, as a response to the killings of civil rights leaders and bombing of black churches in the South. As previously mentioned, King refused to criticize these racial eruptions, saying, “Riots are the language of the unheard.”24 CIA think tanks, like the Rand Corporation in California and the Hudson Institute in New York, developed a number of plans for popularizing their chemical agent against the anti-War uprising. U.S. intelligence used its expanding media assets to help draw many to the San Francisco Bay area. FAIR cofounder Martin Lee said, “In 1967, when the grassroots acid scene was floodlit by the mass media … young people started turning on in greater numbers than ever before … the media catalyzed the widespread use of LSD.”27 Undercover MK-Ultra agents merely awaited the arrival of their test subjects.

They wouldn’t be trying to enforce the law, since police already had many undercover narcotics agents in the Haight.28 Lee and Shlain responded, “A CIA agent who claims to have infiltrated the covert LSD network provided a clue when he referred to Haight-Ashbury as a ‘human guinea pig farm.’” Supporting this description, CIA MK-Ultra scientist Dr. Louis Joylon West rented a place in the heart of Haight-Ashbury for “monitoring” purposes.29 In a very long footnote, Lee and Shlain described other interesting aspects of Dr. West. West had examined Jack Ruby, the murderer of President Kennedy’s purported assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. West determined Ruby was “insane” because Ruby didn’t agree with West’s quick diagnosis of insanity. Dr. West also started a center for violence reduction. It made news when West proposed that very young black males receive psychosurgery and chemical castration as “pre-delinquent” children. West clearly had the same bigoted mentality as his superiors who started genocidal eugenics in the same offices later occupied by MK-Ultra scientists.30 Congregations of politically-left white activists organized with black, Latino and other ethnic activists in urban areas nationwide. The multiracial Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had 53 chapters, mostly in large cities, and then became part of the anti-War movement, especially after King made his famous anti-War speech in April of 1967.31 The number of CIA undercover agents and MK-Ultra scientists in San Francisco, a center for activism, illustrates the way in which U.S. intelligence appeared to create psychedelic wastelands of burnt minds among idealistic young adults. During the summer of 1967, mainstream media provided a “Summer of Love” blitz. Time magazine had a cover story on “The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture.” It should be remembered that Time Inc.’s Vice-President, C.D. Jackson, rotated in and out of his government position as head of Psychological Warfare.32 The Summer of Love media blitz also included a very popular song, “San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)” by John Phillips of The Mamas and The Papas. Scott McKenzie’s recording of the song entered the Billboard magazine music charts in May and reached Number 4 on the charts by the end of the summer.33 Phillips reportedly wrote the song to help bring people to what had been called the first of many widely promoted and heavily attended multiple-band rock music events: the Monterey Pop Music Festival.

Estimates of his acid sales started at about several hundred thousand hits a year, and grew through the 1960s.36 Owsley reportedly started the first amphetamine (speed) laboratory in the Bay area.37 Reports also stated he had dealers distributing both drugs from Haight-Ashbury to Berkeley.38 At that time, Owsley and U.S. intelligence were coming out with more than just acid and speed. Dow Chemical made new drugs for the U.S. Army Chemical Corps that worked hand-in-hand with CIA MK-Ultra scientists. In 1964 Dow developed STP, a hallucinogenic, as a possible incapacitating agent for use by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. The CIA used it for behavior modification experiments. STP, referred to as “Serenity, Tranquility, Peace,” was quite the opposite. People described using STP as akin to “being shot out of a gun” for an intense three-day “trip.” Owsley started manufacturing STP, and “shortly thereafter the drug was in the hippie districts of San Francisco and New York.”39 At the onset of the Summer of Love, someone organized a solstice celebration. Five thousand tablets of STP were given out at that event. Many tripped for three straight days from the superhallucinogen, and San Francisco emergency units were filled with people afraid they would never come down. Doctors thought their patients were suffering from extended LSD trips and gave them Thorazine, but that drug potentiated the effects of the STP.40 Pretty little 16-year-old-middle-class chick comes to the Haight to see what it’s all about & gets picked up by a 17 year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again and again, then feeds her 3000 mikes [of LSD] & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Haight Street gang bang since the night before last.43 Mark’s Place in the East Village neighborhood of New York.

He wrote that by the year 2000, this acid subculture would lead to an alternative “dropped-out” country within the United States.44 At the end of 1967, some well-meaning federal agents not linked with MK-Ultra arrested Owsley at his tabbing factory.45 Owsley had a large stash of LSD and STP with a street market value of $10 million. Despite this vast amount of drugs, reports note that Owsley was quickly released from jail. Owsley continued his work as he fought his trafficking charge in court. Owsley only ended up serving jail time when he was arrested again in New Orleans after a concert as part of a nineteen-member crew working with the Grateful Dead.46 Owsley eventually got a $3, 000 fine and a three-year prison sentence. This appeared to be part of a show to make him appear anti-establishment. Owsley served only two years in a federal prison.47 By then, U.S. intelligence already had a much larger LSD trafficker running operations worldwide: Ronald Hadley Stark.48 “Papa John” Phillips comes into question regarding his song beckoning youth to San Francisco for the first outdoor multi-band rock concert, performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and The Who, along with performances by the Byrds, the Grateful Dead, Otis Redding, Frank Zappa and The Mamas and The Papas, which Phillips led. Phillips cofounded the Monterey Pop Fest, which drew the largest crowds ever to the spy- and drug-infested San Francisco area of Haight-Ashbury. As it turned out, Phillips had a military intelligence background himself, and hailed from a Los Angeles neighborhood that at least rivaled, if not surpassed, the Haight-Ashbury scene regarding spies, drugs and suspicious musicians. McGowan compiled the histories of several dozen rock stars who lived in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles—an astounding aspect of one neighborhood in and of itself. McGowan reported that virtually all of these musicians and many of their partners or associates hailed from military intelligence families. These military intelligence-linked musicians and associates, many of whom also came from extreme wealth, included: Phillips (Mamas and Papas), Frank Zappa, David Crosby (Byrds; Crosby, Stills and Nash), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield; Crosby, Stills and Nash), Jim Morrison (Doors), Mike Nesmith (Monkees), Corey Wells (Three Dog Night), Graham Parsons (Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers) and Dewey Bunnell (America).49 McGowan detailed how John Phillips could be considered one of several leaders of the Laurel Canyon scene (with Frank Zappa and David", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:112:ec54fb4f399b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3397, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "families.

John’s father, Claude Phillips, was a Marine Corps officer and engineer who worked out of Quantico Marine Corps Base. Claude Phillips was also commissioned to Haiti for years, and then Nicaragua, before returning to Alexandria, Virginia, within an hour’s drive of Quantico. John Phillips attended the Annapolis-based Naval Academy before, reportedly, dropping out and then finding himself working with a retired Naval officer and four retired Army generals on a charter boat.50 John Phillips also married Susan Adams, a descendant of President John Adams, before John ended up in Havana, Cuba in 1958, at the time of Castro’s revolution against the U.S-supported dictator, Fulgencio Batista. Phillips said he appeared on a live Havana variety television show at the time. Phillips dabbled in music while also spending two weeks in Jacksonville, Florida, the location of the Naval Air Station and Naval Station Mayport, at the coincidental time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.51 Two months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Phillips left his wife, with whom he had a 5-year-old child, to marry an 18-year-old Michelle Gilliam. Gilliam’s stepmother and mentor, Tamar Hodel, had previously been made pregnant by her father, Dr. George Hodel. The government had charged Dr. Hodel with “offering his young daughter to influential friends at an orgy.” By all accounts, Michelle Gilliam Phillips appeared to be groomed for a bizarre, hypersexual lifestyle with her new 27-year-old husband, who started courting her when she was 16. Over the next few years, Michelle Phillips reportedly had sex with many in the Laurel Canyon scene during their marriage. John’s eldest daughter, actress McKenzie Phillips (One Day at a Time), accused her father of raping her on her wedding night, the outset of a ten-year sexual “relationship” with her father.52 John and Michelle Phillips joined with “Mama Cass” Elliot and Denny Doherty to form The Mamas and The Papas. John Phillips claimed that they spent their first formative weeks as a band on a drug-fueled Caribbean adventure in St. Johns, where they “snorkeled on acid” for several weeks in early 1963. They then went to St. Thomas and sang for “drunken Marines and sailors on their way home from Vietnam.” They came back to settle in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles, where John and Michelle were soon able to afford to buy a mansion.

The Mamas and The Papas first album came out in late 1965 and rose to the top of the music sales charts fast. The group would end up selling nearly 100 million albums.53 Starting in the mid-1960s, John and Michelle Phillips, Cass Elliot, Frank Zappa and David Crosby were some of the musicians who held huge drug and sex-filled parties in their Laurel Canyon mansions. These parties drew music stars such as the Beach Boys and other Laurel Canyon bands mentioned above, along with many bands outside Laurel Canyon. It further attracted many Hollywood celebrities that also drew visitors, such as Warren Beatty, Peter and Jane Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Marlon Brando, Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger, Dennis Hopper, Larry Hagman and, oddly enough, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson. These parties introduced many to LSD, cocaine, heroin and other drugs.54 McGowan detailed how an older artist, Vito Paulekas, worked with the musician leaders in appearing to birth the style and culture that evolved into the “hippie scene.” Paulekas, born in 1913, presented himself as a “beatnick” clay sculptor and dancer. He had attempted armed robbery in his younger years, receiving a 25-year prison sentence before being released to serve in a branch of the U.S. Navy during World War II. Paulekas was also a first cousin of Winthrop Rockefeller’s wife, Bobo. Winthrop’s father, John Rockefeller, had funded eugenics and MK-Ultra projects. Arkansas elected Winthrop as their first Republican Governor since post-Civil War Reconstruction. Paulekas married and fathered two kids in the 1950s, before divorcing and, at the age of 48 in 1961, marrying an 18-year-old girl named Susan Shaffer.55 Susan changed her name to Szou and opened a clothing boutique on the ground floor of a three level building at the mouth of Laurel Canyon “which has been credited by some scenesters with being the very first to introduce hippie fashions.” Upstairs, Vito Paulekas raised their first of several children. On the bottom floor, Vito gave clay-modeling lessons, which included nude models, to Beverly Hills patrons and Hollywood actors. Vito also held dance classes there.56 Benito Mussolini for two decades. Paulekas and Franzoni gathered a group of 35 young dancers, some men but mostly women, who were called “Vito’s Freaks.” The identities of most of these young dancers remain elusive, but Pamela Des Barres wrote an infamous memoir, I’m With the Band, reporting how as a teenager she and other Vito dancers showed up at many of these Laurel Canyon bands’ shows.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:114:307af96a214d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3399, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "to Beverly Hills patrons and Hollywood actors.

Writer Dave McGowan noted that a young Chicago vice cop named Elmer Valentine opened the first Sunset Strip Whiskey-a-Go-Go nightclub in 1964, and then several others on the Sunset Strip soon after. Des Barres said these clubs always let their dance troupe in for free. They gave the bands an instant crowd and popularity, as people came to see the beautiful young people dancing in the audience.57 Vito Paulekas and Carl Franzoni reportedly collected some of their dancers in their communal home by what author Barry Miles described as operating, “the first crash pad in LA, an open house to countless runaways where everyone was welcome for a night, particularly young women.” By the mid-1960s, Vito, his wife Szou, and Carl moved their communal home to a vast mansion and estate called The Log Cabin. They shared the rent in that location with the staff of the previously mentioned psychedelic newspaper The Oracle, started by the U.S. intelligence-linked “Psychedelic Rangers.” A one-hit wonder band, the Fraternity of Man, also lived there, while regular visitors included Timothy Leary and musician Ravi Shankar. Frank Zappa moved into the mansion in 1968.58 More insidiously, these dancers, many still in their teens like Pamela Des Barres, participated in the drug-filled sex parties at the musicians’ Laurel Canyon mansions. They helped introduce countless celebrities and musicians to acid. Des Barres observed that Vito Paulekas and Frank Zappa “never got high. They were both ringmasters who always wanted to be in control.”59 Record producer Kim Fowley and others described the beauty of Vito’s dancers: “Vito was in his fifties, but he had four-way sex with goddesses.” Besides Des Barres, McGowan described dancer Rory Flynn as “Canyonite Errol Flynn’s statuesque daughter.”60 Errol Flynn was likely lured to the area to live closer to work. But Los Angeles’s Laurel Canyon neighborhood housed a large number of people working for U.S. intelligence, since the U.S. Air Force had run its Lookout Mountain Laboratory film studio there since 1947.

Younger Frank went to the Arsenal Complex’s Edgewood School, and his family’s elite connections included his mother having famed composer Edgard Varese call him for his 15^(th) birthday. McGowan reported that Frank Zappa was only twenty-two years old when he partnered with a Marine electronics expert making guided missiles to open a first-class recording studio. It had a custom-built five-track tape recorder when most independent recording studios featured just mono or, at best, two-track recording. By 1963, Zappa played a bicycle as a musical instrument on the nationally televised Steve Allen Show. An international arms dealer named Herb Cohen, who had been in the Congo at the time of the CIA-orchestrated coup against Patrice Lumumba, then became Zappa’s manager. Cohen later managed Linda Ronstadt, the band Alice Cooper and Tim Buckley.62 Regarding Vito Paulekas, writer Carl Gottlieb described how, “Vito and his Freakers were an acid-drenched extended family of brain-damaged cohabitants.” In his book Hippie, Barry Miles wrote, “Vito, his wife Szou, Captain Fuck [Carl Franzoni] and their group of about thirty-five dancers … [called] themselves Freaks, they lived a semi-communal life and engaged in sex orgies and free-form dancing whenever they could … Vito and his Freakers were the first hippies in Hollywood … perhaps the first hippies anywhere.” Nationally released films and other media popularized Vito, Carl and the Freakers, including Mondo Bizarro (1966), Something’s Happening (aka The Hippie Revolt) released in 1967, and You Are What You Eat, featuring David Crosby, Frank Zappa and Tiny Tim (1968). Carl Franzoni later turned up working on The Gong Show, produced by Chuck Barris, who wrote a memoir purporting to have worked as a CIA assassin while chaperoning couples who won trips on another of his shows, The Dating Game. 63 Others also appeared to step in the position of spreading the “hippie” culture nationwide. For example, Stephen Gaskin taught at San Francisco State University, giving courses on subjects such as “witchcraft,” until his job ended in 1967. Gaskin then began lecturing on his own, with as many as 1,500 “pure hippies” reportedly showing up for his weekly talks from 1967 to late 1970 or early 1971 (sources differ). In February 1971, Gaskin traveled with several hundred people in 25 “colorfully painted buses,” along with 35-50 vans and campers, to churches in 42 states for four months.

Who could afford twenty-five buses to paint? promotional tour. Similar to the Laurel Canyon musicians, Stephen Gaskin had volunteered for the Korean War and spent three years in the U.S. Marine Corps fighting in Korea. From 1967 to the start of 1971, the four most important years of the anti-War protests, Gaskin was known as an “acid guru,” regularly lecturing at the “Family Dog rock hall, regularly drawing thousands.” After spending money supporting four months of nationwide travel, the group bought a farm of over 1,000 acres at $70 /acre ($411/acre in 2014 dollars). Granted, the commune, called The Farm, reportedly did charitable work helping various disaster-stricken Central American countries and U.S. cities. Furthermore, after its vast promotional psychedelic bus tour, it also reportedly banned synthetic psychotropic drug use by its commune residents. Still, in the 1980s, The Farm contracted with President Ronald Reagan’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on radiation detectors, and then reportedly did much lucrative work with Homeland Security under George W. Bush in 2004.64 1 Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain, Acid Dreams: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond (New York: Grove Press, 1994), p. 282. 2 William McGlothlin, “Long-lasting Effects of LSD on Certain Attitudes in Normals: An Experimental Proposal,” Rand Corporation Study, May 1962, quoted in Lee and Shlain, Acid Dreams, pp. 197, 199. 3 Ronald Bruce Frankum, Like Rolling Thunder (New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005). 4 Todd Gitlin, The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage (New York: Bantam, 1987), p. 209.

Jim Windorf, “Sex, Drugs and Soybeans,” Vanity Fair, April 5, 2007, http://www. vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/05/thefarm200705. n Great Britain, British MI6 and the Tavistock Institute worked with psychiatrists in a program similar to MK-Ultra. It allowed psychiatrists in England to experiment freely with acid during the 1950s and 1960s, dosing up to 1,500 patients. Their findings were that acid tended to induce schizophrenia only in those predisposed to it. More than fifty of these induced schizophrenic patients disagreed and sued them. While the result of that case is unknown, the U.S. government paid $750, 000 to each of nine patients to settle a similar case, and the Canadian government has also paid dozens of compensation claims.1 By the mid-1960s, the CIA sent its MK-Ultra Deputy Director, Robert Lashbrook, to its London station. Lashbrook had at least two key assignments. One was disbursing Human Ecology Fund grants in England to promote LSD there. Researchers like famed writer A.E. Hotchner, a longtime editor of Ernest Hemingway’s books, said Lashbrook’s other assignment was to have undercover agents give LSD to British musicians, with and without their knowledge.2 British propaganda agent Michael Hollingshead, a top man in the British American Cultural Exchange, had given Timothy Leary his first acid hits. Hollingshead traveled back and forth from New York to London before his major move back to London in the fall of 1965.4 Upon his permanent move back, Hollingshead brought 5,000 hits of LSD with him. Hollingshead said he wanted to start “a drug-based religion for influential British cultural figures.”5 Similar to top MK-Ultra LSD distributors, Hollingshead purported benevolent motives for distributing acid, but his dosing of U.N. officials without their knowledge was in line with MK-Ultra’s leftist hit list. Before the end of 1965, Hollingshead started the World Psychedelic Center in the fashionable Kings Road district of London, where “LSD-dipped fingers of bread were handed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:121:56e13e5bf68f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3406, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "move back, Hollingshead brought 5,000 hits of LSD with him.

Before the end of 1965, Hollingshead started the World Psychedelic Center in the fashionable Kings Road district of London, where “LSD-dipped fingers of bread were handed out gratis, much as today’s supermarkets offer free samples of cookies or salad dressing.”6 Throughout the 1960s, Hollingshead brought well-known psychiatrists to his Center, along with famous artists and musicians, including Ian Sommerville and filmmaker Roman Polanski, along with musicians Donovan, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, and the Rolling Stones. Hollingshead used pirate radio from ships off the coast, the only music radio station to play rock, to further promote acid.7 A few years later, Michael Hollingshead also held parties where anyone thinking they were drinking straight punch was dosed.8 With this in mind, Michael Hollingshead’s travels back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean in 1965 deserve more scrutiny.9 His goal, to get influential British cultural figures tripping, would surely include the Beatles lead singer/songwriter John Lennon. But, similar to most of Hollingshead’s actions that decade, it fell perfectly in line with the plans of known CIA MK-Ultra agents working in London.10 John Lennon founded the band that evolved into the Beatles in Liverpool, England during the late 1950s. Lennon took them to Hamburg, Germany in 1960, where they gained more popularity. Germans flocked to their shows despite young Lennon deriding older crowd members, asking, “What did you do during the war? Bloody Krauts!”11 Lennon brought the Beatles back to Liverpool, where the band morphed and then solidified into the famous four of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr, drawing a nationwide following. By 1963, British television featured them opening for other top-billed bands playing the Prince of Wales theater. Before the last song, Lennon derisively addressed upperclass members of the audience, including the Queen and other royals: “For this number, we’d like to ask your help. Will the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands? And the rest of you, just rattle your jewelry.” In response to Lennon’s class-conscious rebelliousness, the Daily Telegraph compared the Beatles to Adolph Hitler, and their concerts to Nuremberg rallies.12 In 1964, John Lennon continued his antics when first touring America.

Despite skipping these shows, the Beatles accounted for 85% of all American singles record sales that year.13 With Lennon’s actions and superstardom, U.S. and British intelligence surely hid early documents in their closely kept file on Lennon when they later revealed only a few hundred pages. Psychiatrists had already prescribed Lennon amphetamines and barbiturates. Lennon said he had been, “on one drug or another since Hamburg [and] had rarely faced the world straight.” It is likely British intelligence knew this, perhaps even been involved in it the way it was suspected regarding Elvis, leading them to think Lennon might accept LSD.14 In early 1965, Lennon’s Beatles bandmate, guitarist George Harrison, was a patient of a young dentist named John Riley. On a February night in 1965, Dr. Riley had his patient Harrison and John Lennon over for dinner. The two Beatles came with their partners to Riley’s house in Hyde Park Square, London. George’s girlfriend, model Pattie Boyd, described the situation, saying they knew Riley “quite well and had been to a few clubs with him in the past.” The 24-year-old Lennon came with his 25-yearold wife, Cynthia.15 As the drug began taking effect they all felt strongly they had to get out of there. John Riley said they couldn’t leave. Riley then insisted on driving. The four ignored Riley and got into their car, “which looked like it was shrinking. All the way to the club the car felt smaller and smaller, and by the time we arrived we were completely out of it,” said Pattie Boyd. “The club was on an upper floor,” Boyd continued, “and we thought the lift was on fire because there was a little red light inside. As the doors opened, we crawled out and bumped into Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull and Ringo [Starr, the Beatles’ drummer]. John told them we had been spiked.” Boyd said that hours later they decided to go home. “This time George drove at no more than 10mph but if felt like 1,000mph … It was very frightening and we never spoke to the dentist again.” 17 Several people published accounts of this event, but Pattie Boyd’s and Cynthia Lennon’s firsthand takes seem the most accurate.

No one appeared to know the motives for John Riley’s bizarre action or why he would risk drugging his celebrity friend and patient, George Harrison, especially since Harrison had never even heard of the drug yet. But surely there is a reason why he would risk his reputation, his professional career and possibly a criminal charge or lawsuit in drugging these famous musicians, who were already wealthy enough to possibly sue him. John Riley, a dentist for the stars, had a meteoric rise despite mediocre means. Riley’s father worked as a British constable, a beat cop, in the 1950s. This constable sent his son to the very expensive Northwestern University Dental School in Chicago, Illinois, where Riley studied cosmetic dentistry. The Rileys bypassed extremely inexpensive dental schools in England. Staunchly conservative Northwestern also housed the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps.19 Riley “returned to London as one of Britain’s most accomplished cosmetic dentists and quickly became first choice for actors, models, and singers” such as George Harrison.20 Did British intelligence talk to one of their front-line cops, Riley, about his son getting a special intelligence assignment, as happened in the father-son police targeting of other political musicians?21 Riley’s lining up of the sugar cubes showed his intention to dose only the Beatles and their partners. Why else would the sugar be so conspicuously arranged except to make sure they were the ones spiked with acid to go into the four’s coffee. Accounts also have Riley offering to drive them all, since they were tripping, further suggesting he hadn’t taken the acid. 22 It would seem only someone working for British intelligence would take such actions against alleged friends, knowing he was immune to repercussions from these wealthy, influential musicians. Many reports link John Riley’s LSD to Michael Hollingshead, who carried out MK-Ultra-type actions for British intelligence before LSD was more popularized.23 British intelligence, in collaboration with the CIA’s MK-Ultra, appeared to have two goals in targeting John Lennon. First, this would dampen the cognitive abilities of the most intellectual Beatle, who could counter the British elite’s conservative agenda. Secondly, Lennon was a clear leader of the Beatles. The LSD use would make it easier for them to manipulate Lennon, and they would also have a more easily manipulated band to help them popularize LSD. This would help them divert more young idealistic civil rights and antiwar activists to drugs. After John Lennon and George Harrison had a bad experience with their first trip, people around them apparently tried to sway them back he thought Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr should also trip.

After John Lennon and George Harrison had a bad experience with their first trip, people around them apparently tried to sway them back he thought Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr should also trip. Ringo first tried LSD at a party held by Byrds band members David Crosby and Roger McGuin.24 The Beatles and London Daily Mirror journalist Don Short had rented a mansion in Benedict Canyon in California on their 1965 American tour. Paul wouldn’t trip, but Ringo did. Benedict Canyon lied seven miles from Laurel Canyon, where researcher Dave McGowan said Byrds bandmembers Crosby and McGuin lived near the Lookout Mountain Air Force film studio as suspected U.S. intelligence assets.25 Beatles biographer Steve Turner said, “Paul didn’t take LSD until late 1966, after the release of their album Revolver. He took it at the Eaton Row, London, home of Tara Browne, the socialite and heir to Guinness money, who was soon to die and be immortalized in the Beatles’ song, “A Day in the Life.” Browne was the man who “blew his mind out in a car.”26 In 1966, John Lennon made more rebellious public comments without much discretion, such as: “Christianity will go, it will vanish and shrink … We are more popular than Jesus now. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary.” In response, American southern radio and TV stations organized “Beatle-burning” rallies, and 35 radio stations banned Beatles songs. Lennon tried to apologize, explaining that he thought God was in all of us, but his songs were permanently banned in apartheid South Africa. Death threats began to arrive, and the KKK started holding protest rallies at Beatles shows.27 John Lennon had begun getting more overtly political by at least 1966. Lennon said he and his bandmembers were against the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Lennon would repeat these opinions for international reporters. When reporters in Japan asked what he was looking for next, he answered, “Peace.” Questioned about Vietnam, he said that the Beatles thought about the war every day, and “we don’t agree with it. We think it’s wrong … That’s all we can do about it—say we don’t like it.”28 American musicians and others tried to influence the Beatles to use more LSD. British propaganda agent Micheal Hollingshead had brought to England “three hundred copies of The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner; two hundred issues of the Psychedelic Review; and two hundred copies of The Psychedelic Reader, edited by Gunther Weil.

Copies of these books were placed in the hands of the Beatles by Peter Asher’s friend Barry Miles, who was now managing the Indica Bookshop in Southhampton Row.”29 Peter was the brother of Paul McCartney’s girlfriend, actress Jane Asher. U.S. and British intelligence appeared to gain unwitting help in popularizing LSD from the Beatles and other top British musicians. Hollingshead’s World Psychedelic Center in London introduced LSD to top musicians Donovan Leitch, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, and the Yardbirds.30 By fall of 1967, the Beatles ended up stopping their promotion of their latest album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, earlier than planned in favor of a new project. It’s not certain who or what influenced them, but they began recording a new album and making a film based on it: Magical Mystery Tour. This album and film provides an example of how the world’s most popular band, like other bands, promoted LSD, and how intelligenceenmeshed mainstream media amplified such promotion. The Beatles based the project on Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters’ psychedelic bus trip.31 A report from Owsley’s final home before he died said that Owsley Stanley supplied the Beatles with acid during their shooting of Magical Mystery Tour. 32 Paul McCartney later said, “Those were psychedelic times … Magical Mystery Tour was the equivalent of a drug trip, and we made the film based on that.”33 The Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack stayed #1 on the sales charts for eight weeks. When Beatles members and others got tired of acid, the media appeared to give that little attention. George Harrison reportedly “stopped taking LSD after his first visit to San Francisco in August 1967. While he was there he visited Haight-Ashbury [where] … Head shops openly sold drug paraphernalia. Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane lived in old Victorian houses on neighboring streets.” Harrison walked down Haight Street and was flocked by brain-damaged hippies who behaved as if he was a prophet sent from heaven. Harrison said it disgusted him and changed his mind about LSD, deciding to stay away from it.34 In a December 1970 interview with Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner, Lennon described some of his history with LSD. He described himself as becoming “cracked” on it and “unstable.” He said this was especially true in comparison to Paul McCartney, who he said “is a bit more stable than George and I … I think LSD profoundly shocked him, and Ringo.

I think maybe they regret it.” Lennon also said he started having “many [bad trips]. Jesus Christ. I stopped taking it because of that. I just couldn’t stand it.” Later, a friend and publicist, Derek Taylor, along with Lennon’s second wife, Yoko Ono, convinced him acid was okay to use again.35 John Lennon’s LSD use caused him many problems. He had become irrational enough to consider trepanning, drilling a hole in his head to expand his consciousness.36 Lennon also said he thought he was losing his mind. Lennon would later make negative comments about the LSD culture. He talked about The Tibetan Book of the Dead, an LSD tripping guide by Timothy Leary, as “that dumb Leary book.”37 Nobel Prize winning novelist Earnest Hemingway’s editor, A.E. important account of the second best-selling band of the 1960s, the Rolling Stones. Hotchner’s book, Blown Away: A No-Holds-Barred Portrait of the Rolling Stones and the Sixties Told by the Voices of the Generation, provides plenty of evidence detailing how the CIA, and its British counterpart MI6, used drugs and murders to target the Rolling Stones. After working in small London clubs, the Rolling Stones blues covers became chart-topping hits in Britain in 1964.38 By 1965, lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote their own chart-toppers, and had appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and the Dean Martin television show in America. Their first international #1 song, “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” was followed by #1 hit “Get Off of My Cloud,” and a string of others in the following years.39 U.S. and British intelligence used many tactics to manipulate and control the music world in order to influence the mass of youth rebelling against the Vietnam War. They appeared to influence top rock bands to inadvertently become role models to promote acid and heroin, among other drugs. The Rolling Stones lyricists Jagger and Richards had written nine chart-topping singles, and all fifteen of their singles released from 1964 on were in the top ten on the music charts.40 By 1967 in London where the Rolling Stones were based, activists debated LSD’s role in radical leftist action. Some activists had argued for a “politics of ecstasy,” saying acid would radicalize youth. Others opposed that view. Some said, “Don’t give LSD to [Cuban revolutionary leader] Che Guevara, he might stop fighting.” British psychiatrist David Cooper feared drugs might undermine political commitment.

Some said, “Don’t give LSD to [Cuban revolutionary leader] Che Guevara, he might stop fighting.” British psychiatrist David Cooper feared drugs might undermine political commitment. The right-wing Rand Corporation think tank put forth the same thesis, that drugs would undermine people’s commitment to radical politics, and they committed a large amount of money to making that happen.41 Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger had a relationship with singer Marianne Faithfull at this time. Faithfull said that before February of 1967, Jagger had resisted taking LSD. She said Jagger was suing a London newspaper, The News of the World, for libel for saying Jagger was participating in LSD orgies. Jagger, one of the most popular musicians in the world and one with a rebellious reputation, was telling millions he never used LSD, making a dent in MK-Ultra’s goal of creating a bandwagon effect to get people tripping.42 On February 11, 1967, Keith Richards held a party at his Redlands estate in England. David Schneidermann, an admitted LSD dealer, was already working for British intelligence and the FBI when he came to this Rolling Stones party. He helped get Mick Jagger to take his first dose of LSD at that event.43 Schneidermann came to the party with a briefcase full of drugs. The next morning he urged those who stayed overnight, including George Harrison and his wife, to have some of his tea, which contained a hallucinogenic he called “white lightning.” By all reports this was actually his brand of LSD, called “Sunshine.” Mick Jagger drank the tea and had his first trip. They were all tripping for at least eight hours. By that evening, someone else joined the weekend festivities and pulled out a large bag of hashish and passed it around.44 Police raided the home that night. Schneidermann told police he couldn’t open his briefcase, which was full of drugs, as it had undeveloped film in it. They allegedly took him at his word and let him and his drug supply go. They arrested Keith Richards for allowing cannabis to be smoked in his home and Mick Jagger for possession of prescription “pep” pills (a common type of amphetamine).45 By this time, both U.S. and British intelligence were spreading LSD throughout England with the help of Michael Hollingshead. As also mentioned, CIA MK-Ultra Deputy Director Robert Lashbrook had many agents in London trying to get pop musicians on LSD. David Schneidermann (sometimes spelled Sniderman or Schneiderman) told his wife he was working for British agents who were also working with the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro).

David Schneidermann (sometimes spelled Sniderman or Schneiderman) told his wife he was working for British agents who were also working with the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro). This admission made clear that Cointelpro and MI6 were working in close collaboration with the CIA’s MK-Ultra program. Schneidermann made acid and sold it in England.46 Schneidermann’s former girlfriend detailed his role as one of Lashbrook’s MK-Ultra agents. She said, “They’d come up with some new kind of way to make acid,” and Schneidermann would travel from California to England “to sell it.” She added that Schneidermann “was a heavy drug user, but he had a quick wit. He was the perfect choice to infiltrate the Stones.”47 Mainstream London newspaper, The Daily Mail, confirmed that FBI undercover asset Schneidermann, often called the Acid King, set up the Rolling Stones’ Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for a high-profile drug bust.48 The drug bust would spread the word that the two used drugs, and would subconsciously encourage others to emulate their idols and do the same. The bust could have also been for gaining a reverse psychology effect through the ever-increasing anti-establishment youth mantra: “If the government doesn’t want you to do it, it must be good.”49 A final, most prominent motive for the arrest was to impose legal restraints on the Rolling Stones. The Stones were second only to the Beatles among top-selling bands. Some of the Stones top-selling hits were already subversively questioning marketing techniques, such as the 1965 hit, “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” describing watching the TV “and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts can be, but he can’t be a man ’cause he doesn’t smoke the same cigarettes as me.” When the legal cases of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards came to court, the judge showed his extreme bias by saying to the jury, “There is no defense to this charge.” The jury found Jagger guilty in five minutes, and the judge remanded him to prison for three months. A jury also found Richards guilty, and he was sentenced to a year in prison. The London Times editorin-chief said that this sentence for Jagger was “particularly surprising,” as the Rolling Stone singer was a “first time offender,” and “Jagger’s is about as mild a drug case as can ever have been brought before the Courts.”50 Jagger and Richards eventually appealed their sentencing and won their way out of prison, but remained on probation, which kept legal pressure on them.51 Dave Schneidermann ended up in Hollywood, where he changed his last name to Jove and produced", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:129:f2da596919f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3414, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "London Times editorin-chief said that this sentence for Jagger was “particularly surprising,” as the Rolling Stone singer was a “first time offender,” and “Jagger’s is about as mild a drug case as can ever have been brought before the Courts.”50 Jagger and Richards eventually appealed their sentencing and won their way out of prison, but remained on probation, which kept legal pressure on them.51 Dave Schneidermann ended up in Hollywood, where he changed his last name to Jove and produced a television show.52 The following years would find the Rolling Stones inadvertently promoting acid and other drugs, while also coming under attack after writing antiwar songs, as will be discussed.

Hollingshead then “sneaked” acid into prison where he got a top Russian spy named George Blake tripping. Blake had “penetrated the highest echelons of British intelligence and passed information to the Russian KGB.” George Blake reportedly was worried that Hollingshead was a spy who had given him truth serum. Evidence supports both of these possibilities. But Blake then changed his mind.

As will be discussed, in 1971 an unknown group of activists broke into an FBI office in the small town of Media, Pennsylvania near Swarthmore College outside of Philadelphia. They removed thousands of documents and exposed the FBI Counter Intelligence Program (Cointelpro), a vast program aimed at law-abiding citizens protesting against the Vietnam War and for civil rights and economic justice. The documents also showed the FBI’s sophisticated tactics and collaborative work with local police and many mainstream media outlets nationwide. The activists’ distribution of these documents forced Congress and mainstream media outlets to at least acknowledge some of these brutal FBI illegalities with Cointelpro.

If this happened, the very structure of this democratic society would be threatened. By 1968, the U.S. military ramped up its war effort, drafting young Americans to war. Meanwhile, membership in Students for a thanks in large part to the actions of the Columbia University chapter regarding the military draft. Columbia SDS first gained success on campus by educating and mobilizing a majority of students to successfully oppose the class ranking of students based on their academic standing. In the fall semester of 1967, the group also had gained support for their anti-Vietnam War effort by showing the campus proof of Columbia’s involvement with both the Institute for Defense Analysis and the CIA. Leading SDS historian Kirkpatrick Sale wrote in his definitive history, SDS, that despite this revelation, Columbia was going through the “doldrums that practically every chapter encountered at one time or another. Several of the former chapter leaders had graduated or dropped out. Drugs proved a more satisfying answer than politics for many, and certainly less frustrating. Not only did drug use lead many away from SDS, police also arrested SDSers for weed possession, which lessened their likelihood to continue their political work in having to worry about their legal problems.”2 Columbia SDS leadership broke into two groups regarding the way it approached activism. One side was referred to as the “Praxis Axis,” as it revolved around the Praxis theoretical paper insert as part of the national SDS newspaper, New Left Notes. Ted Kaptchuk, Ted Gold and Dave Gilbert led this more theoretically-oriented “Praxis Axis,” which emphasized writing and debating leftist political theory to educate others. Mark Rudd and John Jacobs led the other group, labeled the “Action Faction,” that sought more often to put theory into action. Kirkpatrick Sale said this kind of split happened in SDS chapters nationwide.3 The Action Faction picketed and then held a sit-in to protest Dow Chemical Company recruiters.

Dow manufactured incendiary jellied gasoline—Napalm—dropped on vast swaths of Vietnam (and Dow made STP).4 The Faction also threw a meringue pie in the face of a recruiting officer who came to promote the military to students.5 SDS voted Mark Rudd chapter president.6 By late March of 1968, Rudd led a hundred people through the Roman pillars of the university’s Low Library administration building. They delivered a petition against the school’s involvement with the Institute for Defense Analysis. Columbia placed Rudd, Jacobs, Gold, and three other SDS leaders on probation for that action.7 When gunshots killed Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, there were black riots in cities nationwide. The BBC said rioters sent at least 100 American cities up in flames.8 Back in New York, Columbia held a memorial for King. Mark Rudd interrupted the memorial, making a speech about how the school’s Institute for Defense Analysis program researched riot control and that the school punished students for nonviolent demonstrations, King’s trademark action. He also said Columbia opposed unionization of its largely black workforce and acquired Harlem land for a new gym.9 Columbia building occupiers included the only eight black Columbia undergraduates, radical blacks from outside the university, Latino activists, and some radical Columbia professors. Other radicals, including former SDS leader Tom Hayden, also joined the strikers occupying the buildings. Members of a radical New York City group, Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers (named for what police said to them at times), joined in occupying the buildings.11 With access to university files, students were successful in finding more on Columbia’s and other universities’ collaboration with military actions in Vietnam.12 This uprising gained particular significance because New York was the media capital of the world. Reporters and photographers sent images of the strike around the country and the world that effectively inspired other student protests. On the eighth day of the strike, university officials called in a massive police raid to take the building occupiers out in the middle of the night. Media news footage showed police clubbing strikers whether they physically opposed the police or not. Police dragged students down marble steps. Some students staggered out of Low Library bloody from head to toe. Police injured two hundred students and arrested more than seven hundred. The school reopened on May 6, and police continued to arrest more than 250 students for protesting.13 Columbia in 1968 surpassed Berkeley in 1964 as the most significant student rebellion in U.S. history.

Campuses everywhere were demonstrating, and SDS reportedly played some role in virtually every outbreak.14 Newspapers, magazines, and television programs around the country discussed Columbia. Fortune magazine derisively called SDS the “Che Guevaras of our society … [acting to] overthrow ‘bourgeois’ America.”15 The New York Times, which had a board member who was also a Columbia trustee, a common situation, derided the student protest as a “temper tantrum,” without exposing any negative finding on Columbia support for the Vietnam War.16 After this, Congress passed bills to withdraw financial aid to students who “disrupt” universities. It also denied funds to 22 schools that banned military recruiters. The U.S. president could send federal troops into any situation without sanction. And activists who crossed state lines to participate “in a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot” could get up to five years in prison and a $10, 000 fine.17 After Columbia SDS stopped construction of a gym on Harlem land, Columbia University withdrew from the Institute for Defense Analysis, its administration humiliated. This gained the SDS’s Action Faction many new recruits. Four weeks after the first building takeover, they retook the same buildings to protest disciplinary action against four SDS leaders. Columbia threatened to suspend any student arrested, forcing students to decide between continuing their studies or starting full-time radical activism. Police arrested 160 people at the end of the second student takeover of the same buildings.19 In June of 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. While SDS’s national leadership didn’t make any endorsement of Kennedy, “there were reports of SDSers willing to defect from radicalism if he became the Democratic presidential candidate.” SDS cofounder Tom Hayden reportedly cried at RFK’s casket.20 uture SDS leader Bernardine Dohrn joined the Columbia takeover F while working as an activist lawyer in New York.21 Dohrn began her activist leadership in Chicago. She had attended the University of Chicago Law School and got her law degree at a time when the average law class included fewer than 10% women.22 While in college, she was the student leader of the National Lawyers Guild, the association of leftist lawyers. The January 1967 San Francisco Human Be-In reportedly led Dohrn to help organize a similar event in Chicago in the spring of ^(′)67 .

It is not certain if Dohrn used LSD at that time.23 One-time SDS leader Todd Gitlin said Dohrn painted her legs in psychedelic swirls for the Chicago Be-In. But Gitlin didn’t name Dohrn as the organizer of that event, instead placing the event as the work of a “newly organized underground newspaper called the Seed.”24 Whether the Seed was similarly linked to U.S. intelligence as San Francisco’s Oracle was, isn’t known. One source did say the Seed and the Oracle were two of the first tabloid newspapers to use special split-font inking on a web press. This suggests large initial funds and expertise for these upstart “underground” presses. They also had unusually large funding to be able to distribute some 40,000 copies nationally.25 SDS started turning towards psychedelics in 1967. The SDS national newspaper, New Left Notes, featured a headline article positively covering a “Human Be-In,” held in New York, in its April issue. LSD-promoting groups such as Timothy Leary’s League for Spiritual Discovery co-sponsored the Be-In. New Left Notes also published a November 1967 article by someone living in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, who said, “We left, lit our pipes and popped our acid … we pumped the nation full of acid, pot … Hippies are … an act of rejection, a military vanguard, a hope for the future.” Bernardine Dohrn gravitated towards the psychedelic hippie scene, but it didn’t yet appear to affect her competence. She worked with Martin Luther King Jr. in the mid-1960s, organizing students around both antiwar activities and civil rights. When a gunman assassinated MLK in April of 1968, a friend said Dohrn cried a lot. After, she changed from her signature minidress into “riot gear” pants to participate in demonstrations that included vandalism. She also began talking about urban guerrilla warfare.27 In the summer of 1968, Dohrn traveled to Michigan State University to run for the national leadership position of Inter-organizational Secretary at the SDS national conference. One audience member used the McCarthy “red-baiting” tactic in asking Dohrn if she was a socialist. Dohrn upped the ante and heralded the new political sentiment by replying, “I consider myself a revolutionary communist.”28 Bernardine Dohrn won her SDS position, as did her close political friend Mike Klonsky. A large, more socially conservative group within SDS had a dual affiliation with a national organization called the Progressive Labor Party. Kirkpatrick Sale said members of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) continually created conflicts in chapters nationwide. They started long debates over small points of ideology.

Kirkpatrick Sale said members of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) continually created conflicts in chapters nationwide. They started long debates over small points of ideology. Some believe spies infiltrated the PLP. The fact that former PLP member Phillip Luce worked for the right-wing House Un-American Activities Committee soon after leaving the PLP supports this notion.29 Progressive Labor talked so much about students uniting with workers that the New York group Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers staged a mock marriage between a student and a worker at the SDS convention hall. PLP had positive ideas against the growing drug use amongst SDSers. But their straight-laced look—starched work shirts, coat-and-ties, fifties-short hair, and clean-shaven faces—also allowed easier agent infiltration. Many said PLP’s members’ ideological battles soured people on activism.30 Kirkpatrick Sale noted many old leftist groups at the June ^(′)68 SDS convention. These included Sparticists, Wobblies, Communists, International Socialists and Socialist Workers. While these groups also appeared overly sectarian, PLP had the largest student presence, and they opposed the SDS National Office regulars of Dohrn, Mike Klonsky, et al. Aware that the FBI and police had infiltrated SDS, the National Office regulars created a workshop billed as devoted to the discussion of sabotage and explosives. They wanted to draw many of these undercover agents to that workshop so that they wouldn’t attend SDS’s serious workshops on activist strategy. An agent infiltrator later acknowledged that strategy’s success.31 While the Progressive Labor Party members got one representative elected to the three National Secretary positions, the SDS National Office had virtually all of their candidates voted into the National Interim Committee, a group of the regional SDS leaders. The convention voted Mark Rudd as a first alternate to that Committee and used Rudd’s publicity to make him a national fundraiser. By November, Rudd had raised over $3, 000 in speaker’s fees for SDS.32 Another much smaller activist group, the Youth International Party, or YIPpies, started by Abbie Hoffman, arose with considerable media attention by 1968. Hoffman earned an undergraduate degree at Brandeis and a master’s degree at the University of California-Berkeley, graduating in 1960. He and his wife Sheila married that year and had two children within the next two years. They both participated in leftist activism for civil rights and against the Vietnam War, and helped organize a delegation to go down south and participate in the Freedom Rides with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. By 1965 they organized an anti-War protest and led radical talks by activists at a community center near their home outside of Boston.33 Abbie Hoffman’s stature as an activist grew.

He edited a Boston area leftist newsletter, The Drum. Hoffman also rallied students to help get a third-party anti-nuclear, peace candidate, Harvard Professor H. Stuart Hughes, on the ballot for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. For that cause he gathered 17,000 signatures on a petition for what was reportedly the first progressive third-party campaign since 1948.34 In 1965, Hoffman balanced activism with writing and theater projects. The U.S. Army had drafted Hoffman’s former roommate, Manny Schreiber, and had him work for MK-Ultra on a secret military project testing the effects of LSD on soldiers. Schreiber brought LSD home to Hoffman. At that time Hoffman had never even tried marijuana.35 After that introduction to acid, Abbie Hoffman started using drugs regularly. His wife Sheila, a constant partner in activism, divorced him in 1966, citing his drug use. Hoffman moved away from his kids in Boston, to the Lower East Side of Manhattan that year. That East Village area had a long history of activism While there, Hoffman staged street-theater protests. One of his best known was in August of 1967, when he led fellow activists to the gallery of the New York Stock Exchange. He brought along about 100 or more real dollar bills mixed in with hundreds of fake dollar bills and threw them off the top floor of the stock exchange. Many of the traders frantically scrambled to pick up the bills, creating a metaphor for their rat-like scampering for money. Media groups gave it global coverage.37 In October, David Dellinger of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) asked Berkeley Free Speech veteran Jerry Rubin to help mobilize and direct a march on the Pentagon. 70,000 protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial to hear Dellinger, Dr. Benjamin Spock and others give speeches. Afterward an estimated 50,000, including Hoffman and poet Allen Ginsberg, marched to the Pentagon. Military police stopped the marchers outside the Pentagon. Showing the effects of too much acid, Hoffman and Ginsberg directed people to focus their psychic energy to levitate the Pentagon, at which point they said it would rise, turn orange, vibrate, and end the Vietnam War. Ginsberg led Tibetan chants to assist Hoffman.38 By the summer of 1968, Abbie Hoffman and his new wife, Anika, had teamed up with fellow heavy LSD users Jerry Rubin and Paul Krassner to form the Youth International Party.

The Mobe, the Yippies and others organized a protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Activist groups like SDS and the Black Panthers didn’t get directly involved in the organizing, but did send representatives. SDS sent some 500 members to recruit more people and politically educate the crowd. The Black Panthers had Bobby Seale speak at the protest on one of the five days.39 The day before the convention, the rock group MC5 (“Kick Out the Jams”) and folk singer Phil Ochs played at a Festival of Life concert supporting the protest. There, people passed around acid in the form of spiked honey. Writers said Mayor Richard Daley sent police in en masse, and the Festival of Life became a festival of blood.40 Historians have called the militant reaction to the convention activism a police riot against protesters. Police clubbed and tear-gassed thousands of protesters, left hundreds bloodied, and arrested many. Police took seven leaders of the protest to court in a highly publicized “Chicago Seven” trial. Prosecutors added an eighth, Black Panther national cofounder Bobby Seale, although he had only given a speech and then left the protest. When Seale debated his inclusion in the court proceedings, the judge had him bound and gagged, as made more famous in the Crosby, Stills and Nash song, “Chicago.” Unknown to the Yippie leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, who stood trial and gained national celebrity, Yippie steering committee member George Demmerle was an undercover FBI informant and had acted as Hoffman’s bodyguard during the Chicago protest. U.S. intelligence appeared to put acid-fueled activists Hoffman and Rubin in a media spotlight as top Sixties activist icons, thoroughly linking LSD and activism.41 George Demmerle was one of a number of undercover operatives at the Democratic Convention and among the Yippies. CBS News obtained Army intelligence documents stating nearly one out of six demonstrators at the Chicago convention was undercover. These included, “Bob Pierson, a Chicago cop disguised as a biker who latched onto Jerry Rubin during the convention and became his bodyguard.” Pierson started provocations such as throwing stones at police, pulling down flags, inciting protesters to stop traffic and starting fires in the street that helped police chiefs incite their men to physically attack the protesters.42 The exact number of undercover agents who worked with Demmerle to manipulate Hoffman, Rubin and other Yippies, influencing them to promote acid, remains unknown, but evidence indicates that U.S. intelligence did manipulate the Yippies and used them in this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:139:d286746fba48", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3424, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "the convention and became his bodyguard.” Pierson started provocations such as throwing stones at police, pulling down flags, inciting protesters to stop traffic and starting fires in the street that helped police chiefs incite their men to physically attack the protesters.42 The exact number of undercover agents who worked with Demmerle to manipulate Hoffman, Rubin and other Yippies, influencing them to promote acid, remains unknown, but evidence indicates that U.S. intelligence did manipulate the Yippies and used them in this manner.43 Peggy Hitchcock of the intelligence-involved Mellon Hitchcock family helped fund the Yippies, particularly the March to “levitate” the Pentagon.44 Meanwhile, President Richard Nixon had the CIA expand its Operation Chaos. The CIA’s Chaos enacted strange trivial tactics like use itching powder against leftists, though it also aided U.S. intelligence-orchestrated arrests and assassinations. In the ’50s, the CIA’s benign sounding Technical Services Staff devised operations using LSD. Chaos trained many local police intelligence divisions who pulled off operations, including Bob Pierson’s undercover work as Jerry Rubin’s bodyguard.45 People protested the Democratic Party for President Johnson’s authorization of the horrific carpet-bombing in Vietnam. Additionally, under an operation called the Phoenix Program, the U.S. military conducted assassinations of South Vietnamese civilians sympathetic to the Communists, and they dropped Napalm on innocent Vietnamese. Television news showed many of these images.46 But the Democrats were a party divided, with some standing for the war and others standing in opposition to it. The Republican Party was more solidly supportive of the military operations in Vietnam. In response to this, the acid-saturated Yippie leaders protested only the Democratic National Convention. No similar protest was staged at the Republican National Convention.47 The melee at the Democratic convention was said to help Republican Richard Nixon win the presidential election of 1968 over Vice Once Richard Nixon got into office, he instituted draconian sentencing for drug-possession charges. President Nixon had many leading leftists arrested and jailed on minor drug charges. White Panther leader (and MC5 band manager) John Sinclair was given ten years in jail for two joints. Police put black anarchist bookstore owner Martin Sostre in jail for six years by planting weed in his store. Amnesty International helped get him released. Columbia SDS leader Mark Rudd was arrested on a drug-related charge through an undercover agent.48 In the fall of 1968, Mark Rudd toured campuses trying to use his previous year’s celebrity status to raise money for SDS.49 Shortly after, Bernardine Dohrn and Mike Klonsky worked with groups of people of color, including the Black Panthers; the Latino activists, the Young Lords; along with the Revolutionary Black Workers and dissenting G.I.s.

Black Panther leaders declared solidarity and support for SDS, while the SDS National Office also expressed support for the Panthers. SDS’s New Left Notes declared them the leading Black activist group.50 SDS’s Chicago National Office began to experience U.S. intelligence attacks similar to those against the Panthers and Young Lords, albeit less brutal. For example, police purported getting a call of a shooting at the National Office and demanded to inspect the premises. Then firemen came behind stating a report of a fire. The police and firemen tried to barge into the office while SDSers physically tried to keep them out, thinking it was a police plot to ransack their premises. Police arrested Mike Klonsky and five other SDS leaders.51 In the summer of 1969, Dohrn, Rudd and and nine others formed a committee which released a paper they called the “Weatherman Statement.” It attempted to distance itself from the Progressive Labor contingent and align SDS with youth and revolutionary groups of color. The Weatherman name came from Bob Dylan’s 1965 political song, “Subterranean Homesick Blues”: “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.” The Weatherman Statement focused on fighting U.S. imperialism as it waged war on Third World liberation movements at home and abroad.52 Progressive Labor used the smallest of differences to find fault in other groups under attack by the U.S. It criticized North Vietnamese leadership for trying to make agreements with the United States as part of peace efforts, instead of just continuing the war. It also attacked the Black Panthers with false accusations that they ignored the working class and waged war against whites.53 By that summer of 1969, many other sectarian groups with a history of U.S. intelligence infiltration joined in the SDS national convention. These infiltrators appeared to join collectively against the SDS leadership and two Black Panther members invited to talk at the convention. The Black Panther Party was a vanguard organization that served as a model for organizations formed by other ethnic communities. They were active in at least 45 cities nationwide by this time, though they had also closed membership in many of these cities because the FBI had heavily infiltrated so many of their chapters.54 The 1969 SDS convention had scheduled talks by lesser-known Panthers, including Rufus “Chaka” Walls, Minister of Information of the Illinois Black Panthers, who worked with SDS’s National Office. Walls first criticized Progressive Labor and read a policy letter dismissing the group, approved by Panther National Chairman Bobby Seale. Walls also made a chauvinist remark about women’s liberation as “pussy power,” leading to many “boos” in the convention audience.

Walls also made a chauvinist remark about women’s liberation as “pussy power,” leading to many “boos” in the convention audience. It’s uncertain where Chicago Panther leader Fred Hampton was on this occasion, but another Panther, Jewell Cook, continued a chauvinist line of comments. Cook said that the “position for you sisters is … prone.” This hurt the Weatherman contingent’s appeal to convention delegates.55 The convention became very fractious, with boos and jeers at the Panthers and the Weatherman contingent. Interorganizational Secretary Bernardine Dohrn impulsively decided to walk away from it, and encouraged about 700 others to follow her. This effectively ended the Students for Democratic Society, which had close to 100,000 members by that time.56 U.S. intelligence waged a huge campaign against Dohrn and her comrades at that convention. Did acid use lead to Dohrn’s impulsivity and loss of emotional control to enact that walkout? Sociologist and former SDS leader Todd Gitlin credited Dohrn’s action with “dismantling … the largest American organization anywhere on the Left in fifty years.”57 Still, Dohrn’s Weatherman remained the de facto revolutionary cadre. declined numerous offers to turn on with the Crazies (a militant offshoot of the Yippies) on the grounds that it would interfere with his politics. The Crazies chided Rudd and his cohorts for being straightlaced and ignorant of the youth culture, but Rudd’s crowd was not to be persuaded. Finally the Crazies took matters into their own hands and put acid in the wine at a Weather party without telling the hosts. Historians Lee and Shlain apparently didn’t realize, nor did Rudd and the other Columbia leaders realize, that undercover FBI asset George Demmerle was one of the Crazies’ leaders. Lee and Shlain actually described Demmerle as one of many informants who received training at the FBI’s “Hoover University” in Quantico Marine Base in Virginia. This elite academy taught them how to infiltrate leftwing organizations. These undercover agents “smoked pot and dropped acid with unsuspecting radicals.” Lee said that New York radical circles knew Demmerle as “Prince Crazy,” without connecting him with the Yippie offshoot group.59 Radical anti-War activist Jane Alpert detailed Demmerle’s work with the Crazies. Alpert said Demmerle was thirty-eight-years old in 1968, and his face looked like worn out rubber. He tried to convince her to drop chemicals in manholes of New York’s financial district in order to blow out the supply of electricity to major Wall Street corporations.

Hoffman continued organizing protests in a more clear-headed way against the CIA, and against U.S. intervention in Latin America. Hoffman further organized successfully against nuclear reactors. In 1989 Hoffman was found dead of a reported suicide by barbiturate overdose at 52 years of age.62 to help stop it. For example, Cornell University Medical School professor Donald Louria, M.D. wrote a column addressing this in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. Prof. Louria had a regular column, “Medical Intelligence,” where he first gave an overview of the latest studies on LSD that indicated some substantiation to small benefits from the drug, but he dispelled the truth to claims of any larger benefits.63 Many of the proponents of the LSD experience, undaunted by the lack of documentation of benefits or the many tragedies caused by the drug, are irresponsibly and unconscionably promoting the use of LSD or other equally potent hallucinogens. Advancing facile arguments about individual freedom, trumpeting the alleged ecstasies, minimizing the dangers and depending on personal charisma, these psychedelic missionaries are attempting by every possible overt and covert [emphasis added] technique to inveigle young people into joining the hallucinogenic drug movement. Such proselytizing is extraordinarily difficult to counteract. As with other public health problems, a vigorous education campaign is mandatory if those unalterably committed to the potent psychedelicdrug experience are to be prevented from subverting the majority of young people who are uncommitted but educable. The medical profession must give itself fully to this educational effort but has not yet done so. If responsible persons, including physicians, fail or abrogate their educative obligations, an enormous increase in the use of LSD and other potent hallucinogens, with consequent medical and psychiatric tragedies, will almost inevitably occur. Even more important, the widespread use of LSD, or similar drugs waiting in the psychedelic wings, could lead to a whole generation of psychedelic dropouts, incapable or uninterested in addressing themselves to the important sociologic problems that challenge our times. If this happened, the very structure of this democratic society would be threatened. The recent writings of academicians, scientists, psychiatrists and beatnik philosophers suggest that the LSD problem must be recognized as an integral part of a much larger issue; this, put in its simplest form, is the question of whether man’s mind and emotions in the 21^(st) century should be unfettered or should be controlled by euphoria-producing or hallucinogenic drugs or carefully placed electrodes.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:143:7ab940b005ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3428, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "problems that challenge our times.

Dohrn was an attorney who graduated from the University of Chicago law school. Rudd had risen to the leadership position at Columbia for his inspiring speeches and tactics, with Jeff Jones by his side. Boudin, a bright, inspiring activist, was the daughter of a top radical New York lawyer. W hen these top Weathermen, as the group came to be known, were with through local chapter newsletters, as well as the national SDS newspaper New Left Notes, explaining why they took their radical stances. Other activists published in alternative magazines such as Ramparts, New York City’s Rat and The Guardian, where non-SDS radical activists Jane Alpert and Sam Melville worked.2 The U.S. government put out a barrage of propaganda in the mainstream press to persuade people to support the war in Vietnam and the suppression of Black Liberation leaders. SDS and other activists had to use their limited resources to try to convince people otherwise. They had to be lucid, clear thinking, and knowledgeable about the issues. Acid impaired these abilities. Several of the Weather contingent’s leaders started taking an over-thetop anti-intellectual stand that mirrored their increased acid uptake. Bill Ayers initially had reservations about eating acid. He had taken a major role in the University of Michigan’s Jesse James Gang and then became part of the nucleus of Weatherman leadership. The Jesse James Gang was Michigan SDS’s version of Columbia’s Action Faction. Writer Martin Lee said that a White Panther, Ken Kelley, who edited an underground newspaper, got Ayers to try LSD despite his having reservations about it, and Ayers continued to use it while he was with the Weathermen (a later action by Kelley would put into question his greater allegiance to the Panthers or the FBI).3 Ayers ran for the position of Education Secretary of what remained of the national SDS organization, now split in two, months after Dohrn led a walkout at the summer of 1969 convention. The Weathermen ran one SDS group; Progressive Labor ran the other. In his nominating speech, Ayers announced with pride that neither he, nor former SDS leaders Mark Rudd and Jeff Jones, had read a book in a year.4 The Weathermen first carried out ideas that Ayers proposed for expanding their adherents. Even sympathetic historians regarded these tactics as very futile and counterproductive. Weathermen marched with Vietnamese National Liberation Front flags through local parks comparing the first American Revolution to the need for current revolution.

They also held “jailbreaks”— invading community colleges and high schools, gagging teachers and preaching to classrooms, leading to many Weatherman arrests. They further fought Progressive Labor activists and police with their fists and broken table legs.5 Weathermen interrupted other activist gatherings to announce their October ’69 “National Action” in Chicago. This action involved Weathermen planning a riot in Chicago they would later call the “Four Days of Rage.” They tried preaching to others to recruit more participants in the National Action. Many of these former SDS leaders acted with good intentions after visiting anti-imperialist fighters from Cuba to Vietnam, but their tactics appeared increasingly less effective in their initial year. After Rudd’s first experience with acid in the summer of 1969, his subsequent change of behavior was obvious. He began to promote the use of LSD to the rest of his New York activists, and frequently behaved irrationally. He toured the country “haranguing student audiences, and engaging Progressive Laborites and others who disagreed with him in bloody fistfights.” In general, he also displayed decreasing effectiveness at appealing to college students. In a September appearance at Columbia University, he paced back and forth away from the podium, brandished a chair leg and yelled at the students for being soft, bragging about his preparation for the revolution, saying, “I’ve got myself a gun—has everyone here got a gun? Anyone? No?! Well, you’d better fuckin’ get your shit together.” In September, the trial of the Chicago Democratic Convention protest leaders began. Chicago prosecutors accused the Chicago Seven (actually eight with Bobby Seale) of organizing the protests and creating the riotous atmosphere. Some SDS National Office leaders had attended the Chicago Democratic Convention and were arrested there.7 The Chicago Black Panthers’ highly regarded leader Fred Hampton had organized well with the SDS National Office. But when Weathermen such as Mark Rudd started acting strangely after their acid use, Hampton’s respect for them decreased. Earlier, Rudd made a speech at a Chicago event co-organized by Hampton, and spoke about the Four Days of Rage in an attempt to get the Panthers and white activists involved.

But the first cold night they huddled around a bonfire to keep warm, and found they numbered only about two hundred. The total for the four days drew about six hundred participants. The hundreds wore motorcycle, football, and construction helmets, along with padded bras, pipes, first aid kits, and t-shirts with emergency numbers written on them. Bernardine Dohrn tried to rally them saying it was the second anniversary of Che Guevara’s death.9 Historian Kirkpatrick Sale described how the acid-addled Weathermen went on a rampage chanting “Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh! Dare to struggle, dare to win!” They also shouted, “Bring the war hoooome!” and “Off the pigs!” They threw rocks and bricks through windows of posh apartment houses and smashed the windows of parked cars. They sometimes pummeled a solo policeman in their way. Police ran their cars through the Weathermen throng, indifferent to hitting them. Police also beat many of the protesters until they were mangled and bloody.10 On some days, Mark Rudd put on a fake moustache, suit and tie, and simply watched from the darkness. Police arrested Rudd with three other leaders on the fourth Day of Rage. The Weathermen smashed store and car windows before the police grabbed and brutalized them. All the leaders were arrested except Bill Ayers, Terry Robbins and Jeff Melish. The group faced $2.3 million worth of bail bonds and up to five-year jail sentences. But the longest jail time actually ended up being 112 days, because the most seriously charged went into hiding.11 One faction of the SDS leadership was not aligned with the Progressive Labor faction, nor the Weathermen. This group, Revolutionary Youth Movement II (RYM II) had Mike Klonsky and Noel Ignatin as its spokesmen. The Black Panthers and Young Lords, Chicago and New York-based Hispanic activists, supported RYM II as they held peaceful demonstrations in Chicago. After six Weathermen were shot and sixtyeight arrested during the Days of Rage, Weatherman canceled its planned actions—a rock concert, a march on the Chicago courthouse, and more “jailbreaks” (encouraging students to walk out of school), in order to rethink their mission and strategies.12 Historically, criticism of the Weathermen’s actions must be tempered with an understanding of those violent times. By December 4 in Chicago, police had raided Black Panther leader Fred Hampton’s home and murdered him in his bed. A mass of evidence suggested it was an FBI orchestrated assassination, one that also killed Illinois Panther leader Mark Clark.13 With the media accurately reflecting America’s mass-murder of Vietnamese men, women and children, the Weathermen might be seen as simply reacting by the only means left, as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:149:10866b553aeb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3434, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 150, "text": "the Weathermen’s actions must be tempered with an understanding of those violent times.

Still problematic is the Weathermen’s poor judgment on the best tactics for violent protests against the government-sanctioned genocide in Vietnam. With the national SDS splintered, few were left to carry the mantle of protest on white college campuses. The Weathermen made national headlines with their October action, albeit with articles titled, “Radicals Go on a Rampage.” But campus SDS chapters didn’t know what to do about the split, so campus chapters splintered, fell apart or declared themselves independent. Most called the Progressive Labor SDS irrelevant, while one Wisconsin SDS chapter popularly mocked the Weathermen with the line: “You don’t need a rectal thermometer to know who the assholes are.”14 a national convention to be held in December of 1969. With numerous Weathermen still “underground” they decided to communicate the location of their convention by word of mouth alone. To avoid infiltration around this time, a number of Weather collectives instituted their own “acid tests.” They made new members eat acid with them and then asked if they were agents. It failed to work at times, as exemplified by one undercover FBI asset, Larry Grathwohl. During a two-day trip he said he was a “pig” (police or intelligence agent), but added that being in the Army, he was “a pig for what I did in Vietnam; because I stood by and saw brutality of what was being done to innocent people.” He was accepted into a Cincinnati Weatherman collective and, several months later, fingered two New York female Weathermen for the FBI.15 Early in December of 1969, police arrested Charles Manson and his “hippie” followers for the July 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and four of her friends. Tate, a young film actress, was married to director Roman Polanski (Chinatown), and eight months pregnant with their first child. Attackers had stabbed her forty-nine times with a butcher knife. One attacker also notoriously left a fork stuck in Tate’s belly. They smeared the walls of her Bel Air, California mansion with blood, writing “Piggies” and “Helter Skelter.” These were titles of songs by the Beatles from their popular and sometimes politically radical White Album. Charles Manson had a group of young girls living with him who were taking lots of acid. He convinced them to commit these murders.

Charles Manson had a group of young girls living with him who were taking lots of acid. He convinced them to commit these murders. An underground Los Angeles newspaper named Manson “Man of the Year” and ran his picture with the word “hippie” as the caption. The Weathermen put Manson on a pedestal, saying he offed some “rich honky pigs.”16 By mid-December, with the Weathermen still worried about too much agent infiltration, they let out that the Christmas weekend National Council would be held in Flint, Michigan. SDS historian Kirkpatrick Sale gave a detailed account of this event. Some four hundred attendees showed up in a giant ballroom in a black ghetto of Flint, which they decorated with huge psychedelic posters of Weatherheroes Fidel Castro, Eldridge Cleaver, Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, Lenin, Mao Zedong, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton. While the whole event appeared to reflect some of the more chaotic thinking of the organizers, within the context of the times, things were relatively rational until the nighttime speeches. Weatherleader Bernardine Dohrn began by describing Weatherman actions in the recent months. “We were in an airplane, and we went up and down the aisle ‘borrowing’ food from people. They didn’t know we were Weathermen; they just knew we were crazy. That’s what we’re about, being crazy motherfuckers and scaring the shit out of honky America.” The nail in the coffin for what acid had done to their minds over the year came with Bernardine Dohrn’s excitable speech about Charles Manson’s murderous group. Dohrn exclaimed, “Dig it: first they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room as them, then they even shoved a fork in the victim’s stomach. Wild!”18 The Weathermen later proclaimed 1970 “the Year of the Fork” in Manson’s honor. They also held abstract debates about whether killing white babies was “correct.”19 Acid-fueled irrational adulation for Manson spread. Yippie co-leader Jerry Rubin, coming off his fame in the Chicago Seven Democratic Convention protest trial, expressed his sentiments. Rubin said that when the accused murderer appeared on television, he fell in love with Manson’s “cherub face and sparkling eyes.”20 Researcher Martin Lee, in describing Weatherman’s December National War Council, called it a “drug-crazed Wargasm conference.” But he said that at the close of the four-day conference, the Weathermen “dropped acid and danced all night long,” as if to indicate they had not eaten acid earlier. If, in fact, they were not on acid when they spoke, this suggests the lasting damage the acid did to their judgment. While dancing, Martin Lee said they burst into spirited chants, including the appropriate “Women Power!” and “Struggling Power!”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:151:9ca497e10c0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3436, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "December National War Council, called it a “drug-crazed Wargasm conference.” But he said that at the close of the four-day conference, the Weathermen “dropped acid and danced all night long,” as if to indicate they had not eaten acid earlier.

While dancing, Martin Lee said they burst into spirited chants, including the appropriate “Women Power!” and “Struggling Power!” but also “Sirhan Sirhan Power!” and “Charlie Manson Power!” The Sirhan cheer seemed very inappropriate, given that Robert Kennedy had evolved to oppose the Vietnam War.21 Kirkpatrick Sale said that in later months Bernardine Dohrn came to regret lauding Charles Manson. Sale stated that some Weathermen tried to stop using all drugs at this time. It’s unknown how soon Dohrn and others did stop taking acid, but over the following years they did eventually regain much clarity that helped their anti-War and anti-racist activism. They conducted most of this activism while in hiding. All the Weathermen decided to go underground at this National War Council and to split up into revolutionary cells with eight to ten members.22 By the end of 1969, activists inside and outside SDS and the Weathermen began using different militant tactics. Besides the rioting over civil rights issues, they also started setting buildings ablaze and conducting bombings. They focused these actions mostly on military-related buildings, while also targeting structures related to the government’s murders of Black Panthers. Kirkpatrick Sale wrote that the bombings actually started on college campuses in the spring of 1968 to protest the draft and the Vietnam War. He cited government statistics stating ten bombings occurred on campuses that spring. Protesters reportedly conducted eighty-four bombings in the spring of 1969 on campuses and ten more off-campus. Sale said, “In the 1969-70 school year, by an extremely conservative estimate, there were no fewer than 174 major bombings and attempts on campus, and at least seventy more off-campus incidents associated with the white political left, a rate of roughly one a day.”23 Bombings began in July of that year to protest U.S. violence against people of color in the Vietnam War, and U.S. government violence at home against the Panthers. The Weathermen later printed a book titled Prairie Fire, and Jane Alpert published a memoir, Growing Up Underground. Alpert and the Weatherman writers described how they bombed buildings owned by multinational companies that were bulwarks of American imperialist actions that brutalized third-world people of color. These bombers and others said they used the tactic of consistently calling administrators of the buildings in advance to insure they were cleared, to try and avoid any people getting hurt.24 Alpert’s group is a good example of acid’s effects on intelligent, committed activists who saw their own militancy increase while acid decreased their feelings of sanity and competency.

Jane Alpert thought her activist boyfriend Sam Melville was going crazy after a period of acid use, when he talked about blowing up one of the only anti-War radio stations, WBAI. After Alpert told Melville her thoughts, he tore a mirror off the wall and almost hit her with it.25 Weeks later, Melville realized he was losing it, and said, “I don’t seem to react well to drugs anymore.” Informant George Demmerle hadn’t been part of the group, but Melville accidentally got himself and others entrapped by Demmerle in a bizarre plan, after Melville told Demmerle almost everything about his bombings. Police arrested Demmerle before Demmerle revealed his agent status, and he testified against Melville and the others. (Demmerle and other undercover agents regularly encouraged bombings to gain activists’ arrests.)26 Jane Alpert protested the bigoted justice system by refusing to accept the low bail set for her in New York when the Black Panther 21 had an early bail set at $100, 000 each. The judge rescinded that bail allowance when two of the Panther 21 escaped to Algeria to join Eldridge Cleaver’s Panther leadership there. Alpert finally agreed to leave jail on bail when one-time Harlem Panther leader Afeni Shakur sent her a note saying, “Revolutionaries belong in the streets, not in the jails.”27 Several Weatherman cells followed suit with political bombings in late 1969. By 1970, they appropriately changed their name to the Weather Underground due to their status in hiding and to remove the sexist “man” part of their name. In 1974 they published Prairie Fire: Political Statement of the Weather Underground, in which they listed their long series of politically motivated bombings. Bernardine Dohrn, Billy Ayers, Jeff Jones and Celia Sojourn wrote Prairie Fire and listed well over twenty political bombings they carried out “to retaliate for the most savage criminal attacks against black and Third World peoples, especially by the police apparatus.” The Weather Underground and others also protested the government’s forced draft of young American males to risk their lives carrying out this genocide.28 They further bombed in protest of “U.S. aggression and terror against Vietnam and the Third World,” as well as “institutions that most cruelly oppress, exploit and delude the people.” These included the “Harvard war research Center for International Affairs,” the U.S. Capitol after the invasion of Laos, the Pentagon after the bombing of Hanoi and mining of the harbors of North", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:153:e808db760198", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3438, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 154, "text": "others also protested the government’s forced draft of young American males to risk their lives carrying out this genocide.28 They further bombed in protest of “U.S. aggression and terror against Vietnam and the Third World,” as well as “institutions that most cruelly oppress, exploit and delude the people.” These included the “Harvard war research Center for International Affairs,” the U.S. Capitol after the invasion of Laos, the Pentagon after the bombing of Hanoi and mining of the harbors of North Vietnam. Some other bombings they mentioned included the ROTC buildings, Vietnam War draft and recruiting centers, and the “ITT Latin America Headquarters, following the fascist counterrevolution in Chile in September 1973.”29 Other activist groups joined the Weather Underground in bombing buildings owned by companies or agencies taking part in the government’s murderous atrocities at home and abroad. They all reportedly called in advance to evacuate the buildings in order to spare bodily harm. They targeted ROTC buildings (197 acts of violence, from bombings to window breaking, including the destruction of at least nineteen buildings, an eightfold increase over 1968-69 actions), government buildings (at least 232 bombings and attempts from January 1969 to June 1970, chiefly at Selective Service offices, induction centers, and federal office buildings). Activists also targeted corporate offices connected with American imperialism, such as the Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Bank, General Motors, IBM, Mobil, Standard Oil, and the United Fruit Company.30 The U.S. military’s invasion of Cambodia in 1970, after already bombing the country for a year, sparked some of the biggest protests and reprisals. Sale described how five thousand people stormed the Justice Department building and needed to be turned away by massive doses of CN gas (a highly toxic riot-control agent). Both Attorney General John Mitchell and Weatherleader Billy Ayers said this “looked like the Russian Revolution.” During nationwide protests, the National Guard shot twelve students in Buffalo and two in Santa Barbara, one fatally. In Berkeley, four thousand stormed an ROTC building with tear gas, bottles and rocks. At Harvard, several thousand took over Harvard Square, burning three police cars, and trashed banks and local stores. Students and street people caused $2 million of damage in several nights of demonstrations.31 (Boston), the Smiling Fox Tribe (New York City), an unnamed group around Columbia University, the John Brown Revolutionary League (Houston), the Motherfuckers (moved from New York to New Mexico) and various generally unofficial branches of the White Panthers. While the FBI murderously targeted the Black Panthers, they also targeted the Panther-inspired Puerto Rican Young Lords. In May of 1970, National Guardsmen fired 61 shots at random into a crowd of student protesters, from a distance that was longer than a football field, at Kent State University in Ohio. They killed four and wounded nine, paralyzing one from the neck down.

They killed four and wounded nine, paralyzing one from the neck down. Ten days later, white police officers also killed two black student protesters and wounded twelve more at Jackson State University in Mississippi, which garnered less media coverage. These events sparked 169 bombings and burnings of ROTC and other military-linked buildings that month. Student strikes, violent protests, and takeovers led to the shutdown of over a third of the country’s over thirteen hundred colleges and universities for a period of time. Some fifty schools shut down for the entire year. All the National Guardsmen at Kent State were subsequently exonerated for any wrongdoing.33 In February of 1970, a trial of the New York Panther 21 had begun with trial Judge John Murtagh presiding over it. A report said the Weathermen set off a bomb at the home of Judge Murtagh. They did this because of Murtagh’s well-documented attempt to permanently imprison the New York Black Panther leaders, who were later acquitted of all charges.34 Two weeks after the bomb went off in Murtagh’s home, a New York Weather Underground cell’s bombs accidentally exploded in their temporary home. They had been staying in a Greenwich Village townhouse owned by Cathy Wilkerson’s father, a radio station owner who was away on vacation. Wilkerson had taken the opportunity to assemble bombs there, resulting in the complete demolition of the four-story building. The wife and ex-wife of actors Dustin Hoffman and Henry Fonda, respectively, lived nearby. They helped two naked Weather Underground women, Cathy Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin, get out of the rubble and into clothes. Wilkerson, Boudin and three others escaped. Another three Weather Underground members—Ted Gold, Terry Robbins and Diana Oughton—were blown up beyond initial recognition.35 1 Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain, Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD, the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond (New York: Grove Press, 1994), p. 282. 2 Jane Alpert, Growing Up Underground (New York: Citadel Press, 1990), pp. 145, 185, 187. 3 Lee and Shlain, Acid Dreams, p. 231.

His Brotherhood of Eternal Love had become the top American acid trafficker in the country.4 By 1967 Hitchcock financed the Brotherhood’s LSD manufacturing and distribution group. The Brotherhood produced ten times more LSD than when they had previously worked with Owsley Stanley. Owsley’s partner, Tim Scully, remained a Brotherhood chemist.5 Hitchcock stored much of his money in Castle Bank in the Bahamas, which was “set up by the CIA as a funding conduit for a wide range of covert operations in the Caribbean,” according to Lee and Shlain. Castle Bank’s founder, using a CIA proprietary company, Sea Supply, set up the Golden Triangle mercenary army, which cultivated fields of opium poppies. Sea Supply also supplied weapons to anti-Communist guerillas in that Golden Triangle area near Vietnam.6 With the increased militancy of anti-War protests came a huge increase in LSD production and distribution worldwide, supported by U.S. intelligence. Hitchcock’s links to U.S. intelligence, along with his late 1960s acid trafficking, typified the continuance of MK-Ultra work. In the summer of 1969, a key figure, Ronald Hadley Stark, came into the Brotherhood of Eternal Love with a kilo of LSD (1.5 million doses). When police in Italy later arrested Stark in 1975, an Italian judge ended up releasing him because he “belonged to the American Secret Services.”7 After Timothy Leary left Hitchcock’s Millbrook estate in New York in the summer of 1969, Hitchcock gave Leary a $14, 000 check and had him relocate near his Brotherhood of Eternal Love’s Laguna Beach headquarters just south of Los Angeles. The Brotherhood provided for Leary’s living expenses there and paid for his frequent travels to Berkeley, where they rented a second place for him.8 In September of 1969, police arrested Leary on a marijuana possession charge. Leary went to trial a number of months later, and his sentence made big news, with Leary going to a minimum-security prison. The Weather Underground planned a prison break for Leary. On September 20 of 1970, Leary jumped a fence and climbed into a van driven by Weathermen, before going to the hiding place of Bernardine Dohrn, Jeff Jones and others.

The Weather Underground referred to a “bombing” connected to this, which might have been a small detonation for a distraction of some sort. 9 The Weather leaders described Leary as a political prisoner who was “captured for the work he did in helping all of us begin the task of creating a new culture on the barren wasteland that has been imposed on us by Democrats, Republicans, Capitalists and creeps.” They declared acid and weed would help make a better world in the future, but for now “we are at war … peace is only possible in the destruction of US Imperialism.”10 The Weather leaders got stoned with Leary and housed him for a while. Leary shaved the top of his head, dyed his hair and grew a moustache. He made proclamations through the Weather leaders’ communications channels. Leary, changing for the times, no longer played the pacifist. He now said, “Shoot to Live … To shoot a genocidal robot policeman in defense of life is a sacred act.” Leary seemed to try to appeal to the Black Panthers’ reaction to their genocide by the FBI and police.11 But Leary added, “World War III is now being waged by short-haired robots whose deliberate aim is to destroy the complex web of free wild life by the imposition of mechanical order … Blow the mechanical mind with Holy Acid … dose them … dose them.” He urged everyone to “stay high and wage the revolutionary war.” The Weather Underground helped Leary make this escape with a false passport. Leary and his wife flew to Algeria, where the Black Panthers in Exile had a chapter. Eldridge Cleaver, the former national Black Panther Minister of Information, headed the group with his wife, Kathleen, the former National Panther Secretary of Communications (spokeswoman). They accepted Leary, announcing at a “solidarity” press conference, “Dr. Leary is part of our movement.”12 The Weather Underground role in Leary’s prison break helped Eldridge Cleaver accept him. Cleaver had previously announced his solidarity with SDS, the hippies, Yippies and Weathermen.13 The Cleavers needed to keep their security tight, and they trusted few, particularly since they didn’t get any kind of safety promises from the Algerian government. U.S. intelligence spies remained a concern, and Leary attracted media attention. The Panthers frisked all visitors, even Leary’s friends, and drugs were banned from Panther headquarters except on rare occasions when Eldridge Cleaver said it was okay.

The Panthers frisked all visitors, even Leary’s friends, and drugs were banned from Panther headquarters except on rare occasions when Eldridge Cleaver said it was okay. Leary tried to persuade Cleaver to “free yourself internally before you attempt to free yourself behaviorally.”14 Not long into Leary’s stay, Cleaver put Leary and his wife under house arrest. CIA agents had infiltrated the Cleavers’ Panther encampment, and undercover FBI agents in the New York Panthers were sending poison pen letters to Cleaver. But Cleaver had his own reason to put the Learys under house arrest. Leary had smuggled 20,000 hits of LSD into Algeria with plans of turning Africans on to acid. Kathleen Cleaver said her husband went to the government and showed them the package of acid he had confiscated from Leary.15 Eldridge Cleaver became disgusted with Leary’s stoned escapades. He sent out a communiqué to the underground press saying, “Something is wrong with Leary’s brain. We want people to gather their wits, sober up and get down to the serious business of destroying the Babylonian empire.” Cleaver declared the psychedelic counterculture quasipolitical and dangerous. Lee and Shlain detailed Cleaver’s communication about Evidence indicates that much of Timothy Leary’s prison break and travel to Algeria was a CIA propaganda and espionage operation. For one thing, Leary admitted knowingly working for the CIA since 1962. Secondly, Hitchcock and U.S. intelligence agent Ron Stark’s Brotherhood of Eternal Love financed every step of it, giving the unwitting Weather Underground $25, 000 to fund Leary’s escape from prison. When that plan succeeded, Stark flew to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love’s ranch in California and celebrated the operation’s success.17 Researchers Lee and Shlain said that the Brotherhood also supplied a group of trained professionals to take Leary and his wife out of Algeria. Undercover CIA agents who had infiltrated Cleaver’s Panthers in Exile, likely aided Leary’s freedom and departure. When Cleaver put Leary under house arrest, the Brotherhood bought his freedom for another $25, 000 . A CIAemployed Algerian bureaucrat arranged exit visas for Leary and his wife.18 Upon leaving Algeria, Leary entered Switzerland, where authorities imprisoned him while reviewing his case. A mysterious benefactor and gunrunner, Michel-Gustave Hauchard, pampered Leary while he was detained. Hauchard had strong connections in the Swiss government to achieve Leary’s release. Hitchcock met Leary in Europe, as did LSD’s founding chemist, Albert Hoffman. Hoffman had worked for American intelligence, working with high-level CIA MK-Ultra agents.

Hoffman said the dangers were only psychological and could be avoided with supportive conditions while tripping.19 This statement made Leary appear more a burnt-out, manipulated figurehead than a lifetime committed agent. California police busted Leary when he returned home in 1973, and a judge sentenced him to five years for escaping from prison, plus twenty from his earlier trial.20 Leary then identified the Weathermen and their hideout for the FBI in 1974.21 Leary was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, but in 1976 the government paroled Leary early for good behavior. Leary went on to do a college lecture circuit and even performed in nightclubs as a stand-up philosopher. He later did a college circuit debate tour with G. Gordon Liddy, President Nixon’s operative busted for Watergate spying on Democrats, and the local sheriff who had arrested Leary at Millbrook in 1967.22 The original high-profile sentencing of Leary appeared to serve as a psychological operation and propaganda coup. It continued Leary’s legend and the reverse psychology promotion of acid. Since most youth were antigovernment at this time, busting Leary made it appear that the government didn’t want youth to use acid. Actually, CIA agents and contacts remained the largest manufacturers and traffickers of acid. The U.S. intelligence’s use of acid’s subtle brain impairment to bring down the leftist rebellion continued in order to counter an onslaught of tactics to stop the Vietnam War. Many groups helped to end the Vietnam War. One was a Baltimore-based clergy-linked peace movement. After standard marches, rallies to ending the drafting of young Americans to die in the Vietnam War. In October of 1967, Catholic priest Philip Berrigan, artist Tom Lewis, writer Dan Eberhart and Rev. James Mengel, entered a Selective Service Board office in Baltimore and poured blood on draft files. For this action they became known as the Baltimore Four. While out on bail, Berrigan, his fellow priest and brother, Daniel, and seven other Baltimore activists took draft files from a Catonsville neighborhood of Baltimore and burned them in the parking lot with homemade napalm. They left a statement saying America’s “religious bureaucracy … is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor.”23 This action and some of these same activists helped organize one hundred similar actions nationwide, culminating in the Media, Pennsylvania, FBI office break-in and document theft that exposed the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro), U.S. intelligence’s war on anti-War and civil rights activists.24 Meanwhile, U.S. military atrocities in Vietnam grew.

An “elite” Tiger Force of U.S. troops tortured and executed prisoners. They threw prisoners into “tiger cages” built by Texas military contractor RMK-BRJ, the forerunner of Haliburton subsidiary KBR. The Tiger Force cut off executed prisoners’ ears as souvenirs and made them into necklaces. New York Times bestselling author Mike Davis reviewed more Vietnam War atrocities and quoted officers who had witnessed them. The U.S. military assault on the Vietnamese “grew to the routine slaughter of unarmed farmers, elderly people, even small children.” As one former sergeant said, “It didn’t matter if they were civilians. If they weren’t supposed to be in an area, we shot them. If they didn’t understand fear, I taught it to them.” Women and children were regularly killed. “A 13 year-old girl’s throat was slit after she was sexually assaulted … an unarmed teenager was shot in the back … and a baby was decapitated to remove a necklace.” The latter incident finally got public attention and led to a five-year investigation. Eventually, members of President Gerald Ford’s administration buried the case.25 Students and other young adults heard about many of these atrocities, and they saw friends come home in coffins or as amputees. They empathized with Vietnamese, feared being drafted and killed, and responded in various ways. They tried teach-ins, moved on to nonviolent rallies and marches, then to civil disobedience, then violent opposition. established that there were no fewer than 40,934 bombings, attempts, and threats (by admittedly “conservative” estimate) during these fifteen and a half months, and of the 36% it was able to attribute, something like 8,255 incidents were related to “campus disturbances.” By extrapolation, we can figure that of the other 64% , at least 13,000 incidents could be attributed to student activity, for a total of 21,000 incidents, or approximately 50 every day; of those, also by extrapolation, one can estimate some 2,800 were actual bombings, or approximately six a day for the entire period.26 Other researchers gave similarly large figures, and these actions inspired violent protest in many countries. Author Peter Zimroth cited the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who reported on compiled police sources documenting 4,000 explosive and incendiary bombings over a period of sixteen months. These acts resulted in ^(ω)40 deaths, 384 injuries, almost $22 billion in property damage.”27 Violent anti-government protests increased in Spain, Italy, France, England, Germany, Mexico and many other countries from 1968-1970, as news from American media", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:162:441800d1190e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3447, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "period.26 Other researchers gave similarly large figures, and these actions inspired violent protest in many countries.

When investigators looked at the 1970 Kent State shootings, they found a witness, Dr. Elaine Wellin, who overheard uniformed and plainclothes officers around a ROTC building before and after it was set ablaze. Wellin overheard someone with a walkie-talkie say they should not send down the fire truck, as the ROTC building was not on fire yet. In that same incident, an FBI undercover agent fired a gun four times, which soldiers believed to be protester sniper fire, one minute before the Ohio National Guard commander ordered his guard to shoot at the protesters. This puts into question how many other incidents were orchestrated to bring down martial force against anti-War protesters and try to scare them away from their protest actions.29 Around May of 1971, war protesters tried another tactic. A group calling themselves the Mayday Tribe (or Above-ground Weather Underground) put out a call for a new civil disobedience action—the blockage of government all over Washington DC until the war was ended. Various anti-War activist collectives made their own decisions around blocking roads, bridges, and government offices with barriers and their bodies. The idea was to produce an action that created as much social chaos as possible while still maintaining the support of much of the general public. A final tactic, “fragging” by soldiers, also helped to end the war. Fragging was a shorthand term for setting up a fragmentation hand grenade to explode and kill a soldier’s own commanding officer or fellow soldier. A particularly large number of black soldiers joined other soldiers in conducting fragging against officers who tried to force them into combat zones, partly to oppose the war and partly to spare their own lives. Military lawyers estimated that only 10% of these fragging perpetrators ended up in court. A Congressional investigation reported 1,016 incidents of fragging between 1969 and 1972. Historian David Cortwright noted that incidents of enlisted men assaulting their commanding officers with all sorts of weapons were likely in the thousands near the end of the war. By 1972, President Nixon began de-escalating the Vietnam War.31 n the summer of 1969, the top acid trafficker in the world, Ronald Stark, Icame into the Brotherhood of Eternal Love with a kilo of LSD (1.5 million doses).32 Ronald Hadley Stark started trafficking", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:163:84b37ad90a4c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3448, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 164, "text": "1,016 incidents of fragging between 1969 and 1972.

Stark had business contacts with the Japanese Mafia, who could smuggle acid into mainland China, the Soviet Union, and other Communist countries. British researcher David Black extensively detailed how Stark set up LSD laboratories and international trafficking operations. 33 Stark came to London at the same time as Cord Meyer, who had previously worked as Cultural Affairs Chief for the CIA in Washington. To researcher Black, Meyer coming to London appeared more than coincidence. In his book Acid, he extensively detailed Stark’s work in the CIA and regarding Cord Meyer. Black wrote, “Meyer was the overseer of a world-wide operation to infiltrate international student organizations and promote various cultural foundations which were, in reality, CIA fronts.” In 1967, someone leaked this to the American leftist Ramparts magazine, and the CIA “kicked Meyer upstairs to serve as the CIA station chief in London … the same period Ron Stark arrived there.”34 By the late 1960s, researchers discovered that the CIA was carrying out operations against Americans, contrary to its charter, which forbids it to spy domestically. Of course, the CIA’s Operation Chaos and MK-Ultra worked with the FBI, while Operations such as “Merrimac” embraced various forms of domestic spying. The New York Times archived government documents describing Operation Chaos as the parent operation to Merrimac that targeted anti-War activists. Stark’s activities exemplified the continuation of CIA MK-Ultra’s operations in a widening global arena.35 There is plenty of evidence to support Stark’s status as a U.S. intelligence MK-Ultra superspy. Though physically unimposing, he was described as an accomplished con artist who could speak ten languages fluently and talk circles around anybody. He was bisexual and used drugs and sex to manipulate people. Stark claimed a relationship to the Whitneys, one of America’s richest families. He also maintained an expensive Greenwich Village apartment, understood international finance, claimed seats on many company boards, and assumed Hitchcock’s role as banker and money manager of the Brotherhood.37 Ron Stark communicated on a regular basis with the American Embassy in London, which helped him set up his Belgium lab after the CIA shut down his Paris operation due to local investigators. He had 20 kilos of LSD (fifty million doses) at the Belgium location. Lee and Shlain report it was the largest amount of acid ever to come from one single underground source, and most of it was sold in the United States.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:164:48e119b05e8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3449, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "money manager of the Brotherhood.37 Ron Stark communicated on a regular basis with the American Embassy in London, which helped him set up his Belgium lab after the CIA shut down his Paris operation due to local investigators. He had 20 kilos of LSD (fifty million doses) at the Belgium location. Lee and Shlain report it was the largest amount of acid ever to come from one single underground source, and most of it was sold in the United States. When federal drug agents broke up the Brotherhood, Stark received all the money and property confiscated. Reportedly, Stark immediately started a new British LSD organization to take the Brotherhood’s place.38 As corroborated by British researcher David Black, Lee and Shlain detailed how Stark maneuvered between Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Besides running several acid laboratories and trafficking it worldwide, he also ran a cocaine distribution ring in the San Francisco Bay area without his Brotherhood cohorts knowing about it. By the mid-1970s, Stark’s British group set up acid factories in London and then Wales. Black’s estimates differ from Lee and Shlain’s claim about Belgium producing the most LSD with 50 million doses. British Inspector Dick Lee found that Stark’s laboratories produced “over a hundred million dosages of LSD” in three years, before a police operation uncovered their activities, against British intelligence wishes.39 As the lead British detective to uncover this LSD operation, Inspector Dick Lee wrote a book about his investigation, Operation Julie (a name made famous in a song by The Clash). Inspector Lee said “a British chemical company supplied Red China with 400 million dosage units of LSD.” Did these go to undercover agents working there to undermine Communist China? Did the Opium Wars turn into the Acid War? Inspector Lee received a warning from a high official that “he was not to do anything that might embarrass Her Majesty’s Government.” Lee’s superiors began boxing in his team’s investigation, saying they weren’t allowed to inquire about the LSD traffickers’ Swiss banking accounts, nor their bank accounts in Germany and France. They also prohibited Lee from investigating anyone not already in custody by 1977.40 More evidence came forth regarding MI6 and the Tavistock Institute’s close work with the CIA’s MK-Ultra. Black stated that Ron Stark worked with an intelligence agent who also worked with Howard Marks, while Britain’s MI6 was paying Marks as he was trafficking acid.41 Scientist Steve Abrahms, of the Human Ecology Fund doing work in Britain, also exposed the high-level joint effort of various U.S. intelligence agencies regarding MK-Ultra: “Stark had told me he had worked for the Department of Defense and was seconded to the White House.”42 When authorities arrested Ron Stark in Italy in 1975, they found interesting evidence amongst Stark’s possessions that showed his numerous global government and cultural connections.

Among Stark’s belongings, police found letters headed, “Dear Ron,” from an economic counselor at the American embassy in London. A draft letter from Stark to the American vice-consul in Florence talked about how conditions were not yet right for a coup in Italy. Other letters connected Stark to acid dealers in Amsterdam and Israel. Stark had a British passport with a different name, stamped by Lebanon, Holland and Sweden. Stark also had phone numbers for band members of well-known rock groups, including Rod Stewart’s old band, Faces, the band Deep Purple, and the Grateful Dead.43 And finally, Stark’s documents verified his connection with Italy’s Mafia and undercover agents.45 According to a 300-page report issued by Italian and Belgian investigators, U.S. and other NATO intelligence forces targeted Italy from the 1950s on. The report, confirmed by the Italian Prime Minister in 1990, stated that England’s MI6 and the CIA left “stay behind” armies across Europe that included many agents who had been loyal to Hitler, Mussolini and other fascist Axis-country leaders in World War II. These agents worked directly with the CIA and MI6, creating a parallel secret service to the Italian government’s intelligence agencies.46 An Italian court sentenced Ron Stark to fourteen years in prison for his drug trafficking. Lee and Shlain described how, in 1978, the courts assigned Bologna magistrate Graziano Gori, “to investigate and clarify Stark’s ties to the US, the Arabs, Italian terrorists, and other mysteries. A few weeks later Gori was killed in a car accident. The Italian government subsequently charged Stark with ‘armed banditry’ for his role in aiding and abetting terrorist activities, but he never stood trial on these charges.”47 In April of 1979, Judge Giorgio Floridia ordered Stark released from prison. Floridia wrote that he released Stark due to “an impressive series of scrupulously enumerated proofs” that Stark was actually a U.S. intelligence agent.

Burroughs and White Panther founder John Sinclair. Burroughs wrote about his addiction in his autobiographical novels, Junkie and Naked Lunch, before stating that LSD made people less competent and implying that was why U.S. intelligence tried to get people using it.50 Former acid enthusiast John Sinclair had started the White Panthers based on the socialist Black Panthers and also managed the rock group MC5. Sinclair agreed that the CIA could have been behind the whole acid movement to dampen the effectiveness of the anti-War movement. “It makes perfect sense to me,” he said. “We thought at the time that as a result of our LSD-inspired activities great things would happen. And, of course, it didn’t … They were moving that shit around. Down on the street, nobody knew what was going on.” Sinclair also said LSD blinded him from seeing that everyone didn’t turn on to radical politics from acid.51 With their assets and growing control over mainstream media, the CIA had the means for many MK-Ultra operations. They expanded the size of their 1965 Acid Tests at the three-day long San Francisco Trips Festivals of 1966, where several thousand attended each day.52 This increased to tens of thousands at the “Human Be-Ins” started in San Francisco.53 And twice as many people attended the 1967 Monterey Pop Music Fest, when San Francisco was an acid wasteland filled with undercover CIA agents. An estimated 400,000 people attended the Woodstock Music Festival in upstate New York in 1969. Dealers made sure there was plenty of the Brotherhood’s Orange Sunshine acid for the crowd. “Nearly everybody was blazed on something and unarmed policemen, clothed in bright red T-shirts with the words ‘love’ and ‘peace’ emblazoned across their chest … let the dopers do their thing. Lumps of hash were there.” Once someone is very stoned on these so-called “gateway” drugs, it’s easier to talk them into trying a new drug such as acid.54 At Woodstock, many groups started, or infiltrated, by undercover agents attended: the Yippies, the Crazies (including at least one FBI informant, George Demmerle), Motherfuckers, White Panthers, and Weathermen. Attendee Jane Alpert detailed her conversation there with undercover agent George Demmerle, the Crazies founder. The Yippies’ Bob Pierson, also an undercover agent, and suspected undercover agents in the Merry Pranksters attended.55 Thirty-one bands played at Woodstock, including the Grateful Dead and other acid-rock bands.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:167:62d0b1070db9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3452, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 168, "text": "trying a new drug such as acid.54 At Woodstock, many groups started, or infiltrated, by undercover agents attended: the Yippies, the Crazies (including at least one FBI informant, George Demmerle), Motherfuckers, White Panthers, and Weathermen.

The Yippies’ Bob Pierson, also an undercover agent, and suspected undercover agents in the Merry Pranksters attended.55 Thirty-one bands played at Woodstock, including the Grateful Dead and other acid-rock bands. There weren’t any political speeches at this festival except one unsuccessful attempt by Abbie Hoffman.56 Although known for conducting bombings, the Weather Underground and those in similar activist cells were trying to battle injustice by producing newsletters, books, teach-ins, and participating in rallies. This mass dissemination of LSD decreased their competency as they struggled against the oligarchy and its vast resources. Acid use also became a staple of those who considered themselves “hippies.” Former black activists have stated how police repression of their fellow activists led them to “drop out of activism and join the hippies.” It’s unknown how many other activists the hippie world lured with the attraction of free love and supposed stoned bliss. But with the vastly greater amount of acid produced and distributed by Stark’s minions, the answer is likely at least tens of millions of people worldwide.57 One book, Substance and Shadow, cited Gallup polls reflecting this increased LSD use in the U.S. The poll found only 1% of college students responded to having tried LSD in 1967. That rose to 4% in 1969 and more than tripled to 14% by the end of 1970, peaking in the mid- ?70s. . Another report noted that by 1970, between one and two million Americans had tried LSD.58 Other surveys reported that among young adults, LSD use kept rising until 1979. That year, 25% of young adults, between 18 and 25, reported having used a hallucinogen (predominantly LSD) in their lifetime. Another study found that 16% of high school seniors had used a hallucinogen in 1975, while 25% used one by 1980, the last year before a decrease began among that age group.59 These survey results suggest that while Stark was in prison from 1975-79, his acid laboratories continued without him. The ongoing investigations of these laboratories and distribution rings by honest lower-level police officials, like British Inspector Dick Lee, were a factor in decreasing their activities. U.S. intelligence had duped millions of idealistic young adults into damaging themselves. Carl Oglesby, a 1966 president of the Students for a Democratic Society, wrote about LSD and ’60s activism, summing it up well in an introspective article.

And finally, amongst many other contacts, Stark had documents that verified his contacts with the Italian political underworld. These included: mafia boss and former Prime Minister Giulio Anderotti associate Salvo Lima; “Prince Gianfranco di Montereale, who had previously been implicated in coup plotting; and Graziano Verzotto, a former president of the State mining corporation, Ente Minerario. Verzotto had fled to Lebanon to escape a financial investigation of his association with Mafia banker and P-2 [Masonic] Lodge member, Nino Sindona.” The P-2 Lodge was headed by a former Mussolini Blackshirt, Licio Gelli, who defected to U.S. Army intelligence at the end of WWII, becoming the main liaison between them and the Italian secret service. 46 Black detailed how when Stark went to prison, he pretended to be a Palestinian revolutionary. An undercover agent who worked for this “stay behind” intelligence network, Mario Moretti, joined the revolutionary leftist Red Brigade from its start. Morettti plotted the imprisonment of the group’s leaders, orchestrated the kidnap of Prime Minister Moro and then murdered him. Black said Stark did key work on “the cover-up of the Moro affair in its aftermath, and possibly in the actual events of the kidnap and subsequent murder.” Key players in that assassination linked Stark’s work in the Italian prison system to Moretti’s actions that smeared the Red Brigade and all leftist revolutionary groups.

These committees often fell short of exposing the full panoply of U.S. intelligence operations, and minimized the atrocities they did uncover. Nonetheless, they did publish their findings. A few independent journalists and media organizations reported on some of these findings.

In his book The Covert War Against Rock, Alex Constantine first published part of this document taken from a section on the FBI Cointelpro strategy. The memorandum detailed many tactics used against political musicians. It instructed agents: Show them as scurrilous and depraved. Call attention to their habits and living conditions, explore every possible embarrassment. Send in women and sex, break up marriages. Have members arrested on marijuana charges. Investigate personal conflicts or animosities between them. Send articles to the newspapers showing their depravity. Use narcotics and free sex to entrap. Use misinformation to confuse and disrupt. Get records of their bank accounts. Obtain specimens of their handwriting. Provoke target groups into rivalries that may result in death.2 While the FBI orchestrated lower-level targeting of political musicians in this regard, the CIA and MI6 appeared to have a slightly different agenda in their first work with musicians. Excepting the FBI, the CIA Director supervised all 14-plus intelligence agency directors. A goal of the CIA’s MK-Ultra was to get popular musicians to use drugs and influence other musicians to do the same. This would provide easier manipulation of these musicians, and also aid the CIA’s media assets in their goal of promoting drugs, as these musicians were often seen as role models.3 It would influence the population in general, but particularly the more suggestible teens and young adults protesting racism and the war. Did U.S. intelligence promote and elevate many American musicians in exchange for their collaboration with MK-Ultra goals? As previously detailed, Dave McGowan wrote about the inordinate number of musicians living in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles whose parents had elite military and wealthy white Anglo-Saxon Protestant backgrounds. These bands and musicians included Jim Morrison (the Doors), David Crosby (the Byrds, and Crosby, Stills and Nash), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills and Nash), John Phillips (The Mamas and The Papas), Mike Nesmith (the Monkees), Gerry Beckley (America, of “Horse with No Name” fame). Some of these musicians appeared to aid MK-Ultra goals, such as Jim Morrison’s popularizing of acid, along with Crosby holding the party where Beatle George Harrison tripped his second time and Ringo first tripped.4 Mae Brussells, a radio journalist in the 1970s, listed many famous musicians she believed the CIA targeted through MK-Ultra.

She said, “All of these musicians were at the peak of a creative period and success at the time they were offered LSD. Their personalities altered drastically. Optimism and gratification were replaced with doubt and misery.” Brussels included folk musician Phil Ochs in this list, while noting the incredible fact that he “just happened to be touring Africa when a native ‘robber’ jumped after him and cut his throat so that it affected his singing? [Ochs was] the most political symbol of protest against the war in Vietnam, [whose songs were sung by] Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and many others, selected from millions of U.S. tourists for assault to his vocal chords.” She included a timeline of MK-Ultra and linked murderous operations.5 n 1968, Mick Jagger attended a demonstration against the Vietnam War. I It inspired him to write and release a single, “Street Fighting Man,”an ode to radical anti-War protesters.6 It included the lyrics: “The summer’s here and the time is right for fighting in the streets,” as well as “Hey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution.”7 began regular stops and searches of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from 1967 to 1969. Jagger’s girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, said there were “many, many busts.” She said that on one of these searches of Mick Jagger’s car, the police planted drugs during their search. After the police officer planted the drugs, Jagger then “set the guy up—the detective, whoever he was—to pay him off, and filmed the payoff with a hidden camera. Needless to say, all charges against Mick were immediately dropped. But all that persecution takes something vital out of an artist.”8 Multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who founded the Rolling Stones, was the most publicly outspoken band member against British war policies supporting the U.S. in Vietnam, and as such, a prime target for MI6 and the rest of British intelligence. Jones’s first arrest came on May 10, 1967, the day his bandmates Jagger and Richards went to trial on the Schneiderman setup.9 Jones was convicted for possession and use of marijuana and received a nine-month jail sentence. He was arrested a second time in 1968, and this time sentenced to three years probation. About that arrest, Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman said that a dozen police officers entered Jones’s home, “to bust another one and end the Stones for good.”10 Wyman said they found one planted vial of marijuana.

Citing these two convictions, British authorities denied Jones a visa to leave the country with the Stones in 1969, on their first American tour in three years.11 By the summer of 1969, British intelligence appeared to target Brian Jones more severely. Nicholas Fitzgerald, a member of the Guinness beer family, was a longtime friend of Jones and wrote a book about him. Fitzgerald said that Jones had bought a new home at Cotchford Farm and had people hanging out there, supposedly working on the grounds. Fitzgerald said that Jones couldn’t get rid of these people. Jones told Fitzgerald they were constantly answering his phone and saying it was the wrong number, and hiding his motorcycle from him. Jones also said his phone would go dead mid-conversation.12 Bandmate Bill Wyman said this group’s intimidations led Jones to decay, “physically, mentally and musically.” His inability to join the Stones’ American tour and other factors led Jagger and Richards to at least temporarily ask Jones to resign from the Rolling Stones. After some initial depression, Brian Jones bounced back from this. In mortal fear of prison, he reportedly gave up all drugs except wine.13 Despite these setbacks, Brian Jones had good prospects for the future. Author A.E. Hotchner , the former longtime editor for Ernest Hemingway, said Jones “was enthusiastic about his band plans. He had talked to Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon, and both were seriously considering joining up with him to form a new band.”14 This pairing of socialist John Lennon, with the increasingly politically radical Jimi Hendrix and Jones, would have been a British and U.S. intelligence nightmare because of the bandmates’ universal appeal and leftist political influence. Top military strategists reported intelligence fears of black radicals and white antiwar radicals joining forces.15 On July 3, 1969, Brian Jones died, reportedly due to an “accidental drowning in his swimming pool.” After reading the official reports from witnesses and the coroner about what happened that night, Hotchner found many inconsistencies. The official report was that Brian Jones died of an accidental drowning; the coroner said he might have had an asthma attack. Brian’s father said Brian hadn’t had an asthma attack in years. The coroner also found trace amounts of a speed-like drug and alcohol in his body, but not enough to explain accidental drowning. This led Hotchner to his own investigation, which led to many interviews.16 Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards said, “We were completely shocked about [ Jones’s]", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:177:6253730239fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3462, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 178, "text": "The official report was that Brian Jones died of an accidental drowning; the coroner said he might have had an asthma attack.

This led Hotchner to his own investigation, which led to many interviews.16 Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards said, “We were completely shocked about [ Jones’s] death. I got straight into it and wanted to know who was there and couldn’t find out.” Richards continued, “I’ve seen Brian swim in terrible conditions, in the sea with breakers up to here … he was a goddamn good swimmer, and it’s very hard to believe he could have died in a swimming pool.” Richards concluded: “Some weird things happened the night Brian died … We had some chauffeurs working for us, and we tried to find out. They had a weird hold over Brian. There were a lot of chicks there … they were having a party … It’s the same feeling with who killed Kennedy. You can’t get to the bottom of it.”17 Hotchner detailed the statement of Brian Jones’s close friend, Nicholas Fitzgerald, who gave an eyewitness account. Fitzgerald said he had been to Jones’s home, and Jones asked him to pick up a friend in the nearby village. Fitzgerald said he and a friend had dinner in the village, but couldn’t locate the person to pick up. They called Jones and a strange woman answered the phone. When Fitzgerald asked to speak to Jones, she wouldn’t respond. Fitzgerald heard a lot of noise and loud music as if a party was going on. Jones hadn’t mentioned having any party that night. So Fitzgerald and his friend went back to Jones’s house. A car was blocking Jones’s driveway with its headlights on facing the road. The two walked around to the back where there were woods and a swimming pool. They came to a spot where they could see the pool and saw three men who looked like workmen, overseeing the drowning of a man. One had his hand on the swimmer’s head while another commanded a third man to jump on the swimmer’s back. The commanding man then ordered another man to jump in and help hold the swimmer under the water. Another woman and man watched.18 The man being drowned was Brian Jones. Suddenly, a large man came out of the bushes and said, “Get the hell out of here, Fitzgerald, or you’ll be the next.” Fitzgerald also couldn’t understand how this stranger knew his name, unless he was part of a spy ring watching Jones. Fitzgerald further said he was too scared to tell police or anyone else until he published his account in a book years later.19 of seeing several men drown", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:178:94f83d825096", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3463, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 179, "text": "man watched.18 The man being drowned was Brian Jones.

Fitzgerald further said that after he witnessed the Jones murder with his friend, the friend went missing, never to be seen again.20 The failure of police to detain the party members and investigate this as a murder, as well as the media cover-up of eyewitnesses’ immediate accounts of a drowning, suggests this was an MI6 operation. MI6 has similar, though lesser, control over British media as its CIA counterpart’s over American.21 that police were considering reopening the investigation into Jones’s death, “after claims in two new books that he was murdered. The books both name Frank Thorogood, who died last year, as the man responsible for the killing.” One of the authors, Geoffrey Guiliano, said an unnamed associate of Thorogood’s admitted helping him hold Jones’s head under the water. Witnesses added that Thorogood made a deathbed confession.22 A third author talked to a murder witness who said someone from the group of electricians that murdered Jones may have slipped a drug in a brandy Jones was drinking to make the drowning easier to cover up.23 As discussed previously, undercover U.S. intelligence agents such as David Schneidermann pushed drugs on the Rolling Stones and plan that was also reported by agent Steve Abrahms under MK-Ultra. Music industry workers such as attorney Dan Cronin, who used to work with top musicians for record companies, revealed one of his duties. He said he was told to regularly provide various drugs to the musicians with whom he worked. The question remains: why did drugs become the norm amongst so many musicians? Was this a “natural” phenomenon, or did U.S. intelligence promulgate this trend, not only with acid, but with cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and other drugs?24 By 1968, Mick Jagger gave the CIA and MI6 more reason to target him. Jagger had made political statements to the press, including: “War stems from power-mad politicians and patriots. Some new master plan would end all these mindless men from seats of power and replace them with real people, people of compassion.”25 Besides attending antiwar demonstrations and their lyrics calling “for a palace revolution,” the Stones recorded the song, “Gimme Shelter,” in 1969. This song included the antiwar lyrics, “War, children, it’s just a shot away … murder, rape, it’s just a shot away … Mad bull has lost its way.” In their promotion of that song and its album, Let It Bleed, the Stones scheduled", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:179:56259bf20874", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3464, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 180, "text": "these mindless men from seats of power and replace them with real people, people of compassion.”25 Besides attending antiwar demonstrations and their lyrics calling “for a palace revolution,” the Stones recorded the song, “Gimme Shelter,” in 1969. This song included the antiwar lyrics, “War, children, it’s just a shot away … murder, rape, it’s just a shot away … Mad bull has lost its way.” In their promotion of that song and its album, Let It Bleed, the Stones scheduled a November 1969 American tour. At the end of this tour, they tacked on a free show in California at Altamont Race Track in a musical event billed as Woodstock West. It would be their first appearance in America since Britain allowed them to leave—the same tour that had planned to leave Brian Jones behind due to his drug charge. The Altamont show occurred five months after the murder of Brian Jones, and details suggest it was conceived by U.S. intelligence. For one thing, suspected MK-Ultra collaborators, the Grateful Dead, organized the event, and other bands in the line-up also had suspected intelligence links.26 The Altamont Music Festival took place in December of 1969. Mick Jagger flew to the show by helicopter with Tim Leary seated beside him. Similar to the 1967 San Francisco Human Be-In, Leary sat onstage in full view of the crowd throughout the Stones performance. The media’s elevation of Leary as a figurehead of the anti-War movement must have made it easier for the Grateful Dead to convince the Rolling Stones to include him.27 The Grateful Dead and agents instigated the large gathering of people to trip on acid while ostracizing any anti-War message. The Angels and similar biker gangs included ex-military and helped traffic guns between states. A London Telegraph article noted that the FBI had undercover agents working in Hell’s Angels, purportedly to find and arrest subversives. An ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) agent testified in court that the ATF contracted with the Oakland Angels’ leader Sonny Barger to murder Black Panther National Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver, as well as Cesar Chavez, who headed the migrant farmworkers union.28 The Grateful Dead once again enlisted Oakland’s Hell’s Angels to provide security at the Altamont Music Festival. The Angels were in charge of keeping people off the unusually low, 39-inch-high stage.29 Someone supplied the Angels with 1,000 hits of amphetamine-laced LSD for the event.30 The motorcycle gang guzzled beer and ate amphetamine-laced LSD by the handfuls throughout the day’s festival, leading them to behave in brutal ways. They were well prepared, “loaded with weapons—knives, chains, lead pipes, tire irons and sawed-off pool [sticks] with lead-weighted ends.”31 Dealers of acid and other drugs hawked their wares to concertgoers.

It’s likely these dealers included local undercover FBI and CIA agents, as had been the case at New York’s Woodstock Fest. The crowd of 300,000 suffered so many bad trips, and broken bones from Angels’ beatings, that physicians at nearby Haight-Ashbury and Berkeley free clinics ran out of the antipsychotic treatment for LSD, Thorazine, in half an hour.32 Filmmakers at the festival described many incidents of the Hell’s Angels clubbing anyone who tried to get near the stage, or cameramen trying to take pictures of their bloody bludgeoning.33 Yet cameramen did capture movie film of a murderous incident where someone managed to climb on stage for a moment. When the Rolling Stones were playing “Sympathy for the Devil,” an eighteen-year-old black man, Meredith Hunter, stood near the stage, took out a gun and climbed onto the stage only a few yards from Mick Jagger. Before Hunter could fire the gun, a Hell’s Angel named Alan Passaro pulled him down from the stage, grabbing his gun arm and stabbing him. Other Angels finished the job, killing Hunter. Hunter holding a gun as if ready to shoot. An autopsy revealed he had methamphetamines in his system at the time. An Angel on the stage told Jagger, “You gotta get down … that guy’s got a gun out there and he’s shooting at the stage.” Actually shooting or not, the gun was large, visible and was reportedly loaded.34 What explanation could there be for Meredith Hunter to step up onto the stage with a gun? While theories abound, the notion that someone paid Hunter to do this is certainly possible. Those plotting to kill Jagger likely wanted to divide black activists and white activists. A black man shooting Mick Jagger could have helped drive a wedge between these groups. Mick Jagger was sued by Meredith Hunter’s family, and settled for $10, 000 . In either a bizarre coincidence, or purposeful action to warn others about thwarting a planned intelligence murder operation, some years later Hell’s Angel Alan Passaro was found dead in the Anderson reservoir with $10, 000 in his pocket.35 Attacks on the Rolling Stones continued after the Altamont Music Fest. The Associated Press reported that a former Hell’s Angel named Butch was placed in the witness protection program when he testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Angels had an “open contract” to murder Mick Jagger, purportedly for not defending them over the Altamont stabbing.36 Butch testified to at least two more Angels-planned attempts to murder Mick Jagger.

In the mid-1970s they sent an Angel with a gun and a silencer to stake out a hotel Jagger was to stay in, but he didn’t show. Later, when Mick Jagger stayed on Long Island, a Hell’s Angels chapter tried to carry out a murder plan there. They piloted a boat and transported plastic explosives to Jagger’s house, but were foiled by a storm just before Jagger left that location. The murder of bandmate Jones and the murder contracts given to the FBI-infiltrated Oakland Angels suggest these were a series of successful attempts to scare outspoken anti-War singer Mick Jagger into a lower profile politically.37 Both Keith Richards and Mick Jagger eventually abused or were addicted to such drugs as cocaine and heroin. The intelligence-manipulated mainstream media made them and the late Brian Jones poster children for drug abuse. During this time the Stones stopped writing political lyrics, but began again in the early 1980s with the song “Undercover of the Night,” about the brutality of the U.S.-supported fascist regimes in South America. MTV banned the video for that song, purportedly due to its violent content.38 1 Carl Bernstein, “The CIA & the Media,” Rolling Stone, October 20, 1977, http://www. carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php.

Serge Denisoff, Inside MTV (New York: Transaction Publishers, 1988), p. 284, http:// books.google.com/. U.S. and British intelligence appeared to target musicians from historically oppressed groups, particularly early in their careers. activist rock musicians, one female and one black. Evidence suggests that intelligence agents entered the lives of musical prodigies Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix early in their careers. anis Joplin, whom National Public Radio would later dub the first queen of rock ’n’ roll, had a typically hard time breaking into the male-dominated rock world of San Francisco, but she clearly had star talent early on.1 After growning up in Texas, Joplin attended the University of Texas at Austin, where the school newspaper highlighted the bluesy white singer in the early 1960s. By 1963, she had moved to San Francisco, where musicians such as Toni Brown said, “The word was out that there was this singer … who was going to be very big.” Joplin also became a hit on the second stage of the 1963 Monterey Folk Festival, where she won three singing contests, and major label record companies soon wanted to sign her.2 and who had told another girlfriend he worked for the FBI. Raymond worked for the French Army during the Algerian conflict, and sold a communication system to revolutionary groups in the Middle East and North Africa.3 Joplin’s publicist said years later that neither Raymond’s “name nor his history was his own.” He had “a fraudulent international pharmaceutical company he set up in Canada to obtain drugs.”4 All of this suggests Raymond worked with intelligence agencies in general and likely had joined U.S. intelligence. The physically attractive Michel Raymond was deceitful and manipulative. Raymond obtained pure amphetamines through his fraudulent pharmaceutical company. A musician friend of Joplin’s said Raymond got Janis to use speed regularly until she was “totally strung out. She was emaciated … almost catatonic, just not responding.” Janis’s publicist also said, “Her speed experience was induced by a man. He had been the cause of it. He had brought her lower than she had ever been in her", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:185:06cf41d1688a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3470, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "joined U.S. intelligence.

He had brought her lower than she had ever been in her life.” Raymond asked Joplin to marry him and they were engaged for a while, until Joplin found out he already had a pregnant wife.5 Researcher Mae Brussells stated that Janis Joplin’s first LSD was administered surreptitiously. When Joplin discovered what happened, she ran to spit it out. Her publicist described Janis Joplin’s second acid trip. Someone was passing around a bottle of wine filled with acid and didn’t tell her what was in it. Joplin took a big swig of the wine before someone revealed it was filled with LSD. Biographer Alice Echols wrote that in 1965, during an amphetamine drought in San Francisco, Janis Joplin turned to heroin and became interested in George Hunter, who had moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco and started a band called the Mainliners. Echols related that Hunter’s initial success was “due less to his musical ability than to his good looks and vision.” Hunter also lured beatnik kids, “out of the coffeehouses and onto the dance floors,” with bands and parties. Hunter admitted to Echols that he rejected Joplin’s quest to join his band, saying, “I had no idea [ Joplin] was a musician because the whole scene we were part of was connected to dope [heroin].” It’s uncertain if the Mainliners name stood for “mainlining” (injecting) heroin. They later changed their name to the Charlatans, and some dubbed them the first psychedelic rock band when they started tripping in 1964.7 During this time, Big Brother and the Holding Company moved near the Grateful Dead at Lagunitas, and, “Janis often hung out at the Dead’s house.” Biographer Echols said, “Not everyone in or around the band was shooting speed, but once Janis moved to Lagunitas, she found little support for staying clean.”9 As previously mentioned, the Grateful Dead’s first manager published a 1971 book revealing that the Grateful Dead dealt heroin in the 1960s, presumably to finance their early tours. But it may have had another purpose: to get many local musicians hooked to make it easier to get control over them.10 Pushing speed, heroin and acid appeared to be mainstays in that Janis Joplin’s on-and-off struggles with heroin are well known.

While MK-Ultra undercover agents and scientists manipulated Janis Joplin’s San Francisco home area in the 1960s, it’s uncertain if any suspected agents besides Michel Raymond specifically targeted her. However, researchers filed Freedom of Information Act requests, and FBI documents revealed that surveillance and discussion of Joplin had begun by the time of Woodstock in the summer of 1969.11 In 1970, Janis Joplin planned to participate in two huge, unprecedented anti-War music concerts. These “Festivals for Peace” raised a lot of money for the peace movement. In Joplin’s third appearance on the nationally popular Dick Cavett television talk show, she announced two of these Peace Festivals, with the first scheduled in New York’s Shea Stadium that August of 1970, and the second scheduled for Philadelphia. With a U.S. intelligence tactic used more often later, police refused to provide security for the latter show, and got it cancelled.12 By October of 1970, Janis Joplin had fallen back into using heroin again, which she exclusively bought from her usual dealer. That fall, the dealer’s supplier had apparently given him a batch of heroin that was 40 − 50% pure, four to ten times purer than the average. Joplin died within ninety minutes of injecting it. All of the dealer’s customers would die from that batch. Janis’s sister Laura said rumors persisted that the CIA had arranged her sister’s death, but she didn’t know if there was any truth to them.13 Just before her death, Joplin, with a backup band, had recorded the album Pearl. It included a cover of a song by her one-time lover Kris Kristofferson, “Me and Bobby McGee,” a co-written “Mercedes Benz,” and a birthday song she recorded for famed Beatle John Lennon. Pearl sold over 4 million copies, topping the Billboard sales chart for nine weeks.14 n the U.S, Jimi Hendrix found little fame in the mid-1960s while he toured I with music legends such as Sam Cooke, who was the first black musician to produce his own records before his career was cut short by his murder.15 In 1966 Jimi Hendrix moved to England where he would initially reach stardom. In England, a “former” spy, Mike Jeffery, coerced his way into managing Hendrix. Jeffery had worked for British MI6. Jeffery’s continued partnerships with CIAlinked figures, his sudden huge wealth, and his skills at acquiring CIA-type tax havens in the Bahamas suggests he maintained MI6 work undercover.16 Black artists were a particular intelligence focus because of left-wing radicalism among them.

By 1968, Jimi Hendrix became popular worldwide. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. that year led Hendrix to actively support the Black Panthers and engage in more radical-left activism.17 Former Air Force Secretary Townsend Hoopes said one of the government’s greatest fears was “the fateful merging of anti-war and racial dissension.” The widely admired Jimi Hendrix aided the bridge between the predominantly white anti-War movement and black civil rights activists.18 FBI and police targeting soon began against Hendrix in the U.S., and other countries aided their efforts when Hendrix went abroad. Such collaboration is common through the international police group Interpol. Also, while British and U.S. intelligence collaboration is well known, at least one former MI6 agent said the CIA actually looked to his agency for guidance, as American intelligence was partly created by British intelligence.19 While this relationship isn’t certain, and may have changed over the century, British intelligence’s three-hundred-plus-year head start on the CIA supports the possibility of this claim. When Hendrix traveled north of the U.S. border, Canadian federal police arrested him at an airport, claiming he transported drugs.22 Biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek cited Hendrix saying he’d never take such a risk and that his manager, Mike Jeffery, set up that airport arrest. The biographers described many ways Hendrix’s manager stole from the famed guitarist and tried to sabotage him. Hendrix’s biographers said that, contrary to popular belief, Hendrix produced his first classic album with virtually no drug use. Then, after getting into drugs for a while, Hendrix gave them up except for moderate alcohol and marijuana use.23 The media didn’t give up on their manufactured image of Jimi Hendrix as a constant user of LSD. They also fabricated his having a heroin addiction. Various media sources claimed Hendrix was with different women all the time. In fact, Hendrix was living with his fiancée Monica Dannemann when he was only twenty-seven, contradicting this image.24 guitar legend’s political activist work. Dannemann believed Hendrix when he said he thought Jeffery dosed his drink with a large amount of acid before one political benefit show that caused him to end his set early.

Jeffery gained Hendrix’s freedom by purporting to have help from a larger Mafia family.26 Researchers have previously noted the CIA/FBI/Mafia links. Hendrix biographers Shapiro and Glebbeek believe Jeffery set up this Mafia kidnapping to intimidate Hendrix not to fire him, as Hendrix was reportedly trying to do at the time.27 On another occasion Jeffery brought over a Mafia marksman to intimidate Hendrix regarding a business deal.28 The Hendrix biographers also said Jeffery’s business partner, band manager Jerry Morrison, was a former propagandist for a CIA-supported Haitian dictator.29 Jeffery controlled Jimi Hendrix in other key ways, besides just trying to keep Hendrix from participating in any political activism. Jeffery created a concert schedule that had Hendrix criss-crossing the country from one concert to the next, leaving him exhausted with jet lag. This helped Jeffery and others around Hendrix to more easily manipulate him and push drugs on him. When Jimi Hendrix finally fired the former MI6 agent, Hendrix was dead within forty-eight hours.30 Rumors still swirl about the manner of Hendrix’s death, and none of the accounts are completely consistent. Monika Dannemann reported that on September 17, 1971, the day after Hendrix finally fired Jeffery, she found her fiancé unconscious in their London apartment bed before noon. Hendrix had been at a party the night before where people had given him pills. He showed her the handful then flushed them down the toilet. Unable to sleep, he took multiple doses of Vesperax sleeping pills. The next morning, she went out briefly and came back to find Hendrix unresponsive. Dannemann called an ambulance. Hendrix died either before arriving at the hospital or an hour after, according to differing reports. While biographers Shapiro and Glebbeek found some discrepancies within Dannemann’s account of Hendrix’s last twenty-four hours, most of their eyewitnesses’ reports backed Dannemann’s general description.31 The coroner reported that what Hendrix had in him—a non-fatal dose of sleeping tablets, a small amount of alcohol, a trace of the barbiturate Seconal, and 20 mg of amphetamine—shouldn’t have killed him. So the official cause of death was described by one source as possibly being: “inhalation of vomit due to Barbiturate intoxication.”32 It is likely that at the party someone spiked Hendrix’s drink with the amphetamine, and possibly the Seconal, found in his system. Monika Dannemann’s memoir and Shapiro and Glebbeek’s biography described how official foul play was rife after Hendrix’s death.

Monika Dannemann’s memoir and Shapiro and Glebbeek’s biography described how official foul play was rife after Hendrix’s death. Dannemann said that when police investigated her place, they failed to take anything, and warned her to not say anything about the death. An official British inquest resulted in the London coroner and the inquest members declaring an open, inconclusive verdict on Hendrix’s death. The inquest called only three witnesses to testify: Dannemann, Hendrix’s road manager and the coroner. They failed to have the ambulance workers, the people Hendrix saw at the party, or the hospital doctors testify. Additionally, when Dannemann traveled with reporters to whom she could give her opinions about Hendrix’s last twenty-four hours and officials’ foul play thereafter, someone damaged Dannemann’s thinking and communication by dosing her with LSD.33 After his death, press accounts described Jimi Hendrix as an “overdosing … wild man,” and a violent, hard drinking, drugged up sex maniac.34 Police said that on the night he died, Hendrix left a message on the answering machine of his friend and former manager, Chas Chandler, in which he said, “Help me, man!” Chandler said he didn’t own an answering machine. In 1975, the magazine Crawdaddy investigated and concluded that a death squad of undercover intelligence agents killed Hendrix.36 While that magazine’s sources aren’t known, in 1992 England’s Attorney General ordered an inquiry. Scotland Yard also re-examined the case, but failed to conclude that foul play occurred. Dannemann, Shapiro and Glebbeek easily contradicted Scotland Yard, exposing their cover-up of contradictory evidence. Scotland Yard claimed to quote Hendrix’s attending doctor, Dr. John Bannister, saying Hendrix was “dead on arrival … [dying] in the ambulance or at home.”37 The ambulance workers denied this.38 The hospital’s official report had Hendrix’s hospital arrival time as 11:45 a.m., and pronounced dead at 12 : 45 p.M.³⁹ Dannemann claimed Hendrix was alive when the ambulance workers took him from their apartment. Whether or not Hendrix was dead on arrival, what happened during that hour? Scotland Yard couldn’t give Dannemann an answer. When she asked what Dr. Bannister had to say about it, Scotland Yard told her he had been struck off England’s official medical register of all doctors in the country, without any further explanation.40 Mike Jeffery confiscated all of Hendrix’s recordings and belongings in his New York studio.

On albums and memorabilia, Warner records made over $100 million in sales, while Al Hendrix was only given $2 million.41 As happened in other targeted musicians’ deaths, several close to Jimi Hendrix died in uncertain ways after him. Close friend Devon Wilson last saw Hendrix at the party the night before he died. Months later, she died of a reported overdose, but friends who saw the scene of her death said it looked like a violent murder.42 Several people sued Mike Jeffery for money he owed them. A judge allowed Jeffery to travel for business during the trial, and he reportedly died in a plane crash in 1973. Because a witness only saw Jeffery’s jewelry to identify him, some believe he escaped with the shell company fortunes he amassed. Jeffery created his tax haven shell with the same Bahamas institutions that worked earlier with William Mellon Hitchcock and later with George H.W. Bush’s CIA in the BCCI/Iran-Contra scandal.43 Another Hendrix-linked death occurred much later. Monica Dannemann said Jeffery threatened to kill her if she published the memoir about Hendrix she wrote in 1971. She said she lost her book manuscript twice between 1971 and 1973, first to a thief she believed Jeffery sent, and then to a Jeffery associate.44 In 1995, she finally published a book about Hendrix’s activist political plans, Jeffery’s sabotage, and government coverup. News reports said Dannemann killed herself in 1996. Her close friends believe she was murdered. They said Dannemann received death threats over the years, and had just finished a long interview for a film on Hendrix.45 In 2009, new information came to light regarding Mike Jeffrey’s work on behalf of British and U.S. intelligence in their orchestration of Jimi Hendrix’s murder. One of Jimi Hendrix’s roadies, James “Tappy” Wright, published a memoir, Rock Roadie. Wright claimed that Mike Jeffery made a drunken confession in Wright’s apartment one night in 1971. Wright said Jeffery confessed to having Hendrix murdered. The emergency room doctor, John Bannister, also said that after examining Hendrix it was “plausible” that Hendrix was murdered. 46 Police investigating Hendrix’s death failed to investigate Mike Jeffery despite Hendrix’s lawyer, Henry Steingarten, and Monika Dannemann knowing that Hendrix had just fired him. While it’s widely reported Jeffery “formerly” worked for MI6, a London Times reporter also wrote that Jeffery “flaunted his connections with organized crime and the FBI.”47 1 Laura Sydell, “Janis Joplin: The Queen of Rock,” National Public Radio, June 7, 2013, http://www.npr.org/2010/06/07/127483124/janis-joplin-the-queen-of-rock. 2 Alice Echols, Scars of Sweet Paradise:", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:191:c6710912118d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3476, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 192, "text": "was “plausible” that Hendrix was murdered. 46 Police investigating Hendrix’s death failed to investigate Mike Jeffery despite Hendrix’s lawyer, Henry Steingarten, and Monika Dannemann knowing that Hendrix had just fired him.

Mike Jeffery inserted himself into managing several other bands. They all reported Jeffery’s negative manipulations and control over their careers. Mike Jeffery then developed Caribbean tax havens with banks that did U.S. intelligence work. He created similar shell companies as Death Row Records owner Dave Kenner. On such Caribbean bank work as CIA and Pentagon-type work through BCCI as part of the Iran-Contra scandal, see “Banks and Narcotics Money Flow in South Florida,” US Senate Banking Committee report, 96^(th) Congress, June 5-6, 1980, p. 201; Jonathon Kwitney, The Crimes of Patriots: A True Tale of Dope, Dirty Money, and the CIA (New York: Touchstone, 1987), p. 153. Both cited in Constantine, The Covert War on Rock, p. 64. On Jeffery associate Jerry Morrison likely being CIA, he had done five years of public relations work for Haiti’s Pentagonbacked brutal dictator, “Papa Doc” Duvalier. See Shapiro and Glebbeek, Jimi Hendrix, pp. 279-80. The New Columbia Encyclopedia (William Harris and Judy Levey, eds., New York and London: Columbia University Press, 1975), described Duvalier as army-backed and in office through a “sham election,” after which he declared himself “president for life.” It further said he led a “reign of terror … summarily executed his political opponents” and had his son succeed him in 1971.

Dannemann claimed, and this was backed by Shapiro and Glebbeek, that Hendrix’s first album, Are You Experienced, considered a masterpiece by most, was done six months before Hendrix ever used LSD. Purple Haze, for example, was the name of diffused light in a Hopi Indian folklore book. A batch of LSD out of San Francisco then took on that nickname. Shapiro and Glebbeek, p.148. Various media then turned this around, saying Hendrix’s Purple Haze song was about LSD. For example, it’s consistently referred to as “psychedelic” or “acid rock” and was played in the scene of the top movie, Apocalypse Now, when one of the characters is tripping, http://www.allmusic.com/style/acid-rockma0000012327/songs. 24 Dannemann, The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix, p. 177. 25 Dannemann, The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix, pp. 46-49. 26 Shapiro and Glebbeek, Jimi Hendrix, p. 280. 27 On Mafia kidnapping and Jeffery/Morrison freeing Hendrix, Shapiro and Glebbeek, Jimi Hendrix, pp. 393-96. 28 On Jeffery’s association with Mafia and intimidation of Hendrix with Mafia, see Shapiro and Glebbeek, Electric Gypsy, pp. 294-96, Constantine, The Covert War Against Rock, p. 62.

Wright further quoted Jeffery as saying, ^(*)I was in London the night of Jimi’s death and together with some of our old friends … got a handful of pills and stuffed them into his mouth … then poured a few bottles of red wine deep into his windpipe. I had to do it. Jimi was worth much more to me dead than alive. That son of a bitch was going to leave me.” This appears as an actual drunken confession and then a lie as to why, to cover-up the confession.

The emergency room doctor who worked on Jimi Hendrix backed this account. After James Wright’s book release in 2009, reporters interviewed the emergency room doctor, John Bannister, who supported Wright’s claim, saying it was “plausible” that he was murdered. Bannister said, “The amount of wine that was over [Hendrix] was extraordinary. Not only was it saturated through his hair and shirt, but his lungs and stomach were absolutely full of wine… He had really drowned in a massive amount of red wine.” Aislinn Simpson, “Jimi Hendrix murder theory ‘plausible’ says ER doctor,” The Telegraph (London), 7/2/09, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5869491/J. 47 Dominic Wells, “Was Jimi Hendrix Murdered?” The Times (London), 7/4/09. W hile the Beatles officially broke up as a band around 1970, Beatles lead singer/songwriter John Lennon had a solo career from about 1968 until 1975. Lennon initiated his split with the Beatles after he started dating Yoko Ono and separated from his wife Cynthia in 1968. He began producing songs solo or with Yoko in late 1968, and married her a year later. 1 Some say the fact that Yoko Ono’s family was one of the wealthiest in Japan suggests her work for a collaborating Japanese intelligence agency. This is uncertain. John Lennon did say he was having a lot of bad acid trips and decided to stop taking it for a while, but both Ono and his Apple Record label press officer encouraged him to keep using acid.2 John Lennon also started using heroin with Yoko Ono, who", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:196:71e6d24966cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3481, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 197, "text": "her a year later. 1 Some say the fact that Yoko Ono’s family was one of the wealthiest in Japan suggests her work for a collaborating Japanese intelligence agency. This is uncertain. John Lennon did say he was having a lot of bad acid trips and decided to stop taking it for a while, but both Ono and his Apple Record label press officer encouraged him to keep using acid.2 John Lennon also started using heroin with Yoko Ono, who reportedly tried it before him.3 Lennon ended up writing the songs “Me and My Monkey” and “Cold Turkey” about his heroin addiction, before detoxing from the drug in the 1970s.4 John Lennon’s drug use failed to stop him from developing radical leftist politics. He talked about being an atheist and started associating with nationally known anti-War activists Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and Rennie Davis. He held anti-War events and did a benefit concert to free imprisoned activist John Sinclair. Lennon had sporadically written songs about radicalism with the Beatles, such as “Revolution.” Once he went solo he continued to produce more-radical political songs including “Give Peace a Chance,” “Working Class Hero,” “Imagine,” and “Power to the People.” Lennon also paid for billboards in twelve countries announcing: “WAR IS OVER – IF YOU WANT IT.”5 Despite stopping the use of LSD, Lennon’s earlier use of acid had residual effects, appearing to cause him hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, a not-uncommon problem with heavy acid users. Lennon had toured comfortably with the Beatles for years, but on his own in the 1970s, he admitted he vomited for hours before taking the stage, due to performance anxiety.6 Lennon continued to write activist songs and, in 1972, he produced an album titled Some Time in New York City. The album was almost exclusively political, supporting feminists, Irish Nationalists and Black Panthers. Asked in 1971 if he was becoming increasingly radical and political, he said, “In my case I’ve never not been political, though religion tended to overshadow it in my acid days.”7 For four years Lennon fought with President Nixon’s administration while they tried to deport him via extradition for a 1968 possession-ofmarijuana charge in Britain.10 Lennon believed the marijuana arrest was a frame-up. It occurred when John and Yoko took up temporary residence in Ringo Starr’s London apartment. A reporter warned Lennon that a detective and his drug squad were after him. Lennon cleared the apartment of any drugs, but believed the drug squad planted some marijuana. The detective who was on the scene would later be charged with corruption. Lennon pled guilty and paid a 150-pound fine to avoid a conflict with the government that could have gotten Yoko deported.11 In 1972, when the FBI were following Lennon’s activities prior to the Republican National Convention, a source told the feds that Lennon had contributed $75, 000 to the group planning to disrupt the Republican’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:197:c6b38c07a8fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3482, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 198, "text": "apartment of any drugs, but believed the drug squad planted some marijuana.

About the same time, the FBI issued a memorandum—one of over hundreds of pages in his FBI file—stating a domestic arrest of Lennon on drug charges could make him deportable. The documents also revealed how the New York City Police Department was attempting to arrest both Lennon and Ono for narcotics use in 1972, “to neutralize any disruptive activities of” Lennon.12 Another biographer also lent credence to heavy intelligence involvement in Lennon’s life. He wrote that FBI agents, “attended his concerts, studied his song lyrics … CIA men shadowed him in his private life … and tapped his phone.” On the Dick Cavett Show, Lennon said what really scared him was how openly and brazenly he was harassed. Even so, Lennon continued to address peace rallies, including one in New York attended by 20,000 people in 1972.13 Lawyer’s Conclusion: CIA Murdered LennonFenton Bresler made broader claims in a 1989 book, Who Killed John of experience, conducted an eight-year investigation showing there was an extensive cover-up regarding Lennon’s murder. Working as London’s Daily Mail and Sunday Express legal correspondent, Bresler said he fought for years with functionaries of the Freedom of Information Act to get copies of 217 pages that the FBI had in their file on John Lennon, and four pages that the CIA had in their file on him. Bresler said the FBI pages alluded to many more pages in the CIA files that they wouldn’t release.14 These and other FBI Cointelpro documents, along with findings by a judge and former Cointelpro agent Wes Swearingen, indicate the ongoing political targeting of John Lennon.15 Many other research investigations, including one by the New York Times, revealed how the CIA joined in these operations against American leftists in the 1970s with its Operation Chaos.16 While Operation Chaos officially ended in 1973, former CIA agents such as John Stockwell reported its continuance. High-level CIA whistleblower Victor Marchetti also reported Operation MK-Ultra’s continuance, and further evidence supports this.17 By 1973, public outcry along with overt and underground activists’ work, led political leaders to investigate U.S. intelligence’s corrupt activities. Congress began an investigation into U.S. intelligence’s covert operations that year. Richard Helms, the CIA Covert Operations Director, feared people would find out about the MK-Ultra program.

In the 1950s, Helms’s CIA Director Allen Dulles had allowed him to run a percentage of the programs without a formal contract. This reportedly would help protect the reputations of academics running the program by having deniability that they officially worked for the CIA’s MK-Ultra program. Helms at least temporarily stopped MK-Ultra in 1973 and destroyed all documents connected with it (though many remained in linked financial departments).18 Focusing more on Lennon’s murder, Bresler uncovered evidence of much government foul play against the musical icon, and the author reviewed the known political activism of Lennon that put him in opposition to the incoming Ronald Reagan’s right-wing presidential administration. By the early 1970s, Lennon considered himself a socialist and, “became more and more active in radical politics.”19 Lennon stayed out of the public eye from 1975 to 1979, to focus on raising his new son Sean. In 1976, Lennon finally got his Green Card, allowing him to stay in the U.S. In 1980, Lennon released two albums of music that quickly rose to the top of the charts. 20 Lennon also signed a legal document about the Beatles agreeing to reunite for a concert within the next five years, partly to stop a stageshow called Beatlemania. 21 While spying and threats of deportation led Lennon to closet his activism after the early seventies, this changed in 1980. Shortly after his musical comeback, Lennon sent press releases about his support for an important Teamsters strike. As noted by a Newsweek “Special Report” on Lennon, written after his murder, Lennon was scheduled to march with the striking workers and sing at their rally. The workers were Japanese-Americans striking for equal pay with their white counterparts. And, Lennon was just one month away from being allowed to become an American citizen when he was killed.22 The FBI and CIA files obtained by Fenton Bresler indicated the FBI had ordered their agents to keep Lennon under constant surveillance.23 On December 8, 1980, at 10:50 p.m., John Lennon came home with Yoko Ono to their New York apartment in the Dakota building. Twenty-five year-old Mark Chapman was standing near the sidewalk entrance to Lennon’s apartment as Lennon walked by. When Lennon was less than twenty feet away, Chapman took out a .38 caliber snub-nosed gun, crouched in a combat stance and fired at him. Chapman hit Lennon in the back and shoulder with four highly lethal hollow-point bullets.

Lennon was rushed to the hospital where he died after doctors spent eleven hours trying to save him.24 In Who Killed John Lennon? Fenton Bresler cited evidence incriminating U.S. intelligence concerning Lennon’s murder and investigation. Bresler detailed his evidence indicating that the CIA orchestrated Mark Chapman’s assassination of John Lennon. In summary, Bresler documented how an Atlanta area police officer trained Chapman in shooting and gave him the bullets with which he killed Lennon, on behalf of U.S. intelligence. Phil Strongman, a critically praised music writer who authored five books and edited another two, also investigated Lennon’s murder for his book John Lennon: Life, Times and Assassination. Strongman agreed with Bresler about the Atlanta police officer, whom Strongman names as Dana Reeves. Bresler said Reeves had a pseudonym, Gene Scott, and only used that name (but Reeves will be used here). Fenton Bresler and Strongman separately gave provocative evidence that Reeves guided Chapman through his path of becoming a drugged and hypnotized CIA tool, in the way other investigators believed had been done with Robert Kennedy’s assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. Bresler detailed how Reeves had first known the younger Chapman when he was still in high school. Bresler cited Chapman’s history of drug use at that time, including the regular use of LSD beginning at age fifteen and heroin use while still a teenager.26 lanta area, where he developed a close relationship and extreme control over Chapman by the time he was nineteen years old. Chapman’s parents feared Reeves’s involvement with their son, and said the police officer changed their son’s personality. For example, the parents and others described Chapman as anti-gun throughout his teens, but Reeves turned Chapman on to guns, training him to be a very competent shooter. Chapman had worked at a regular YMCA summer camp in Atlanta. In 1975, Chapman applied for exotic positions in YMCA’s abroad program, first unsuccessfully in the Soviet Union, despite not speaking Russian, and then working in Beirut, Lebanon in June 1975. He had just turned twenty in May.27 Bresler believed that the CIA “blooded” Chapman in Beirut to aid his becoming a programmed killer. Bresler described this as exposing someone to the kind of constant gun murders going on in war-torn areas such as Beirut, in order to desensitize them to killing.

Bresler described this as exposing someone to the kind of constant gun murders going on in war-torn areas such as Beirut, in order to desensitize them to killing. Many researchers, such as Watergate muckraker Bob Woodward, described the massive CIA presence in mid-1970s Beirut. The country was involved in its second civil war at that time.28 Beirut was also the site of a U.S. naval intelligence base and a CIA assassination training camp.29 Furthermore, Philip Agee, a leading CIA-whistleblower, cited the CIA’s use of international YMCA facilities for their operations abroad, and said that at least two active CIA officers were on the YMCA’s board of directors. Chapman had reportedly never heard gunfire before and brought home tape recordings of bombs, gunfire and screams from the wounded people just outside the windows of his temporary home, working for the YMCA in Beirut.30 After about six months in that position, Chapman received a job, as special assistant to the director of the YMCA’s camp, working with 5,000 South Vietnamese refugees for five months in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. A percentage of these refugees had been working for the U.S. military’s puppet leader of South Vietnam in the war that just ended.31 Fenton Bresler said that refugee camp placed thousands of refugees into homes and then closed up in December of 1975. Dana Reeves picked Mark Chapman up from Arkansas and took him back to Atlanta. They were living together in 1976, when Reeves suggested that the 21 year-old Chapman get a job as an armed security guard. Chapman had quickly turned from hating guns to scoring an 88 out of a 100 in a pistol-shooting test for which he only needed to score a 60.32 By January of 1977, Mark David Chapman decided to make a move halfway around the globe to Hawaii—a location with seven major military bases. On a security guard’s salary, Chapman flew to Hawaii, came back again to Atlanta briefly and then was back in Hawaii again. This time, biographers purported that Mark David Chapman was diagnosed and treated for clinical depression at Castle Memorial Hospital, a Seventh Day Adventist hospital, in the summer of 1977. University of California Professor Peter Dale Scott stated that Chapman actually went through CIA-developed behavior modification at Castle Memorial Hospital.33 Bresler and Strongman agree that in Castle Memorial and in other locales, the CIA was developing Chapman into an assassin. Bresler detailed how after two weeks of treatment at this private hospital, they released Chapman. Weeks later, Castle Memorial Hospital hired him to work in maintenance, and then in customer-relations there for the next 27 months, until November of 1979.34 In support", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:201:b7f0878aff97", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3486, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 202, "text": "California Professor Peter Dale Scott stated that Chapman actually went through CIA-developed behavior modification at Castle Memorial Hospital.33 Bresler and Strongman agree that in Castle Memorial and in other locales, the CIA was developing Chapman into an assassin.

Weeks later, Castle Memorial Hospital hired him to work in maintenance, and then in customer-relations there for the next 27 months, until November of 1979.34 In support of Bresler’s, Strongman’s and Prof. Scott’s claims about Castle Memorial Hospital, Chapman’s biographers reported Chapman flew around the country and around the world at least twice. In one of the trips he visited a dozen countries for over six weeks, at times staying in expensive hotels. This would have been highly improbable on his meager salary. Castle Memorial Hospital reportedly “gave him a loan” to do this.35 In late 1979, Chapman left his job at Castle Memorial for another security guard job in Hawaii. Soon after, Chapman started becoming very interested in a book, The Catcher in the Rye. Bresler and Strongman believe Chapman’s CIA handlers used the book as one of their hypnotic triggers for Chapman. In 1980, shortly before Chapman came face to face with John Lennon, he was back living with police officer Dana Reeves, who trained him to improve his marksmanship. Reeves also gave Chapman special police hollow-point bullets. These bullets are extra-deadly as they expand upon impact and tear up the body more.36 Around the first week of December, an article said, Mark Chapman somehow attained a $2000 loan from the credit union of Castle Memorial Hospital again, despite not working there in a year. The article said he used it to travel to Chicago to see his grandmother, before heading to New York. On the night of December 8, 1980, Chapman came to John Lennon’s New York City address and waited for Lennon to arrive late from his recording studio. When Lennon arrived, Chapman kneeled down in a combat stance and shot Lennon with four bullets closely cropped in a tight circle in Lennon’s back, from about 20 feet away. Chapman shot a fifth bullet that missed Lennon falling to the pavement. A statement from the coroner at Lennon’s autopsy reports it was difficult to distinguish the separate bullet holes.37 There were few at the scene. Yoko Ono had come home with John Lennon but had been far ahead of him, inside their apartment building when Chapman shot Lennon. She told the man at the desk to call the police and then came outside to kneel beside her husband. A witness from an apartment building across the street described only being able to see two people—Mark Chapman and the apartment’s doorman, Jose Perdomo, at the gate of the apartment.

Chapman could have escaped to a subway entrance just across the street. Instead he took off his coat, folded it up, and took The Catcher in the Rye out of the pocket.38 Despite Lennon being declared dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital, a team of seven surgeons tried to resuscitate him, to no avail, as he had lost 80% of his blood.39 When Fenton Bresler investigated John Lennon’s murder, he talked with Lieutenant Arthur O’Connor, who headed the New York police district of one million people, where Lennon had lived. Lt. O’Connor said he had never experienced such pandemonium: “Within two hours of Lennon’s murder, there were literally 150 reporters at the station house. It was like we were under siege.” This exemplified the international interest and influence of Lennon, underscoring why his leftist activism was a threat to the CIA and the oligarchy.40 Lt. O’Connor admitted to Bresler that someone could have programmed Chapman for the murder of Lennon. “I studied him intensely,” he said. “[Chapman] looked like he could have been programmed, and I know what you are going to make of that word! That was the way he looked and that was the way he talked.”41 He was the second police officer to make this assessment.42 After Chapman was arrested for killing Lennon, his bizarre behavior was never checked with a drug test.43 So, attorney and crime reporter Fenton Bresler believes the CIA’s MK-Ultra program hypnotized Mark David Chapman, with the aid of drugs, to become an assassin. Author Phil Strongman agreed with Bresler’s general assessment. Bresler reviewed the history of MK-Ultra, and quoted other researchers, such as former CIA official John Marks, and attorney Daniel Sheehan of the Christic Institute, who also investigated cases of MK-Ultra hypnotized assassins.44 Strongman had one different belief regarding the icon’s assassination. Strongman believed that the CIA likely used a backup marksman to aid in the assassination of John Lennon. Strongman stated that the full name of the doorman seen with Chapman at the murder was Jose Joaquin Sanjenis Perdomo. Strongman said that “various other books, and newspaper accounts, have established links between the Dakota doorman ‘Jose’ and a Jose who was an active anti-Castro Cuban. Cuban Information Archives have shown that a ‘Jose Joaquin Sanjenis Perdomo’ was active during the CIA’s 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion as an armed member of Brigade 2056.” Other authors interviewed a CIA spy employee who said Perdomo had been on the CIA payroll for at least ten years, including", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:203:d484e282835f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3488, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 204, "text": "Jose Joaquin Sanjenis Perdomo.

Strongman further claimed that one of the first policemen on the scene of the murder initially believed that Perdomo, rather than Chapman, killed Lennon.45 Whoever actually fired the fatal bullets, evidence indicates that U.S. intelligence was involved. Bresler said that government officials then took part in a cover-up. Various officials altered evidence and reported losing official documents to stymie his investigation. For example, when Bresler documented Chapman’s exact travel in the days leading up to Lennon’s murder, he found that officials altered some documents on Mark Chapman’s itinerary, and reportedly “lost” other key official documents regarding the days just prior to the murder.46 Bresler found many contradictions concerning Chapman’s whereabouts in those days. When Bresler later asked for copies of the official record, government administrators first denied Bresler access, before the New York District Attorney’s office said it had disappeared from the office records. Bresler noted that this was in line with the YMCA saying it couldn’t find its records on Chapman’s work with them, as well as the fact that many CIA and FBI documents in Chapman’s file allude to particular pages that were never released.47 Millions grieved over John Lennon’s death at the early age of forty. His widow Yoko Ono asked for people to conduct silent vigils on December 14. New York Mayor Ed Koch, actress Jane Fonda, and her husband, SDS leader-turned politician Tom Hayden, convened with an estimated 100,000 in Central Park. Estimated hundreds to thousands gathered in city squares all over the U.S. and around the world, including 20,000 in Liverpool, England, and several thousand in Melbourne, Australia.48 By that Christmas, radio stations worldwide played Lennon’s anti-Vietnam War song, “Happy Xmas (War is Over)” multiple times daily.49 In line with Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and others, John Lennon’s life and death presents another example of the way American and British intelligence targeted leftist musicians. They appeared to manipulate Lennon to promote certain drugs while he was alive. When he began moving away from drugs and more towards activism, evidence indicates that they murdered him.

Miles Copeland’s brother, Stewart, founded the band The Police in 1977. These names, I.R.S. and The Police, seemed either ironic or purposefully obvious in order to suggest no possible malfeasance from children of a high-level CIA officer.51 Stewart Copeland’s father reportedly helped The Police get shows worldwide, while son Miles worked as their manager, making them famous fast. (Police lead singer Sting ran into conflicts with the Copelands, eventually starting a solo career in 1984.) Similar quick fame came to other sons of military intelligence and the wealthiest families, such as CSN’s David Crosby, the Doors’ Jim Morrison, and others mentioned previously. Miles Copeland also started at least three other record companies besides I.R .S. Miles Copeland III further developed a huge music management roster of musicians he helped make into stars, such as Lou Reed, the Go Gos, Gary Numan, The Alarm, Squeeze, and Adam Ant. Copeland had graduated from college in 1966 and then promoted his first concert before getting a Masters degree in business at the American University of Beirut in 1969. He started British Talent Management in the 1970s. Copeland’s immediate power and influence in the British music industry was similar to that of previously MI6- employed Hendrix manager Mike Jeffery.52 intelligence-advising father’s footsteps. The McCaws gained influence over the media by way of large ownership in cable television networks and other communications companies. The sons accumulated a net worth of at least $750 million each.54 Other U.S. intelligence leaders set up similar spheres of influence in music and entertainment.55 Parallel with U.S. intelligence using organized crime to aid in their assassinations and their programs pushing drugs, they appeared to allow organized crime figures to dominate in the ownership of music publishing, clubs, labels and promotion. Organized crime also controlled record distribution and music tours through its power in the Teamsters Union.56 At least one publisher, Lou Wolfe of Covert Action Quarterly, said the Mafia also owned East/West, the sole magazine distributor to kiosks and newsstands. Wolfe believed East/West collaborated with the CIA in barring his and most other leftist magazines.57 In the 1990s, Time Warner expanded its music holdings. Warner Music merged with EMI music, and combined over six well-known music labels— Warner Brother Records, Elektra Entertainment Group, Atlantic Group, Capitol, Virgin, and Priority, which they aggregately called WEA.

These companies each owned a multitude of independent labels. They made up nearly a quarter of the total music sales, with three other companies controlling the rest. Warner EMI dominated the market along with three other companies— Universal Music, BMG entertainment, and Sony Music. They soon formed an oligopoly, acting as a unit to control an entire industry. Time Warner owned Warner Brothers motion pictures and WB Television, and had additional vast holdings in dozens of cable TV stations, book publishing, and video production. They had the most media holdings of the four companies that dominated what The Nation magazine called “The National Entertainment State.”58 The ruling oligarchy and U.S. intelligence apparently pursued the goal of controlling music for several reasons. First, they recognized that musicians arguably had the greatest influence over people’s hearts and minds. Secondly, U.S. intelligence believed that control over the entertainment state would allow them to censor leftist musicians, promote apolitical and right-wing musicians, or popularize musicians who promoted drug use. That is what they appear to have done. 1 In 1968, John Lennon left his wife of several years, Cynthia Lennon, for his future wife Yoko Ono. Some researchers believe that Yoko Ono was inserted into John Lennon’s life to control him. While this theory remains somewhat dubious, a few aspects of John’s life with Yoko support the notion. First, Yoko One came from one of Japan’s wealthiest families. Secondly, Yoko’s actions were reportedly harmful to Lennon. 3 Several reports state that Yoko convinced Lennon to try heroin for the first time. Other reports depict Lennon’s purported thousand hits of LSD led him to become increasingly dependent and subservient to Yoko. Yoko, in turn, used this to lead Lennon to become dependent on the guidance of occultists.

W hen the American drug-trafficking oligarchy sought additional sources for drug weapons they found what they were looking for by turning their gaze southward to Latin America. U.S. intelligence then spent decades developing this locus of drug cultivation with the aid of Nazis whom it helped hide in Latin America. These Nazis helped U.S. intelligence gain increasing control of the region, in opposition to indigenous leftist movements. While former Nazis developed communities in various Latin American countries, indigenous leaders had successfully begun shedding the shackles of the Spanish and Portuguese colonialists who dominated the region. One such leader, future Cuban revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, grew up in a leftist Argentine family. He then attended medical school and worked as a physician. Before Che finished medical school, he rode a homemade motorcycle around Latin America, where he saw the dominions of the United Fruit Company engender vast poverty, hunger and disease. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was also a stockholder and attorney for the United Fruit Company while his brother, Allen Dulles, headed the CIA in the 1950s.1 Che Guevara and Fidel Castro became iconic revolutionary leaders who redistributed land to the peasants, raised the literacy rate from around sixty-eight percent to ninety-six percent in two years, and introduced affirmative action programs in the universities.3 Attacks on Cuba and its new leaders came immediately and often.

In 1961, Cubans repelled 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles who landed by boat in the Bay of Pigs Invasion.4 The CIA’s Technical Services Division that ran MK-Ultra plotted ways to use psychedelics on Castro, his brother Raoul, and Che. They devised a psychedelic aerosol spray to use against them. The U.S. Senate’s Church Committee detailed how they plotted to spray Castro’s “broadcasting booth with a chemical which produced similar effects to LSD.” They also “impregnated a box of cigars with a chemical that produced temporary disorientation” to discredit Castro. The Church Committee further found at least eight CIA plots to assassinate Castro.5 In 1967, Che brought a battalion of fifty Cuban troops into the jungles of Bolivia.6 Che had some early successes against the Bolivian army regulars in the spring and summer of that year. As a result, the CIA had brought on extra help from a local CIA asset with a history of expertise in counterinsurgency work, who helped the Bolivian army capture and execute Che Guevara in October of 1967. The asset also had a key job of organizing cocaine trafficking with local Bolivian drug lords.7 he person the CIA enlisted for aid in killing Che in 1967 was former TNazi Klaus Barbie, a top asset in Bolivia whom the CIA had transplanted from France after World War II—nicknamed the “Butcher of Lyons,” for the genocide he perpetrated in Lyons, France. Barbie also killed every Communist and Jew he found without regard to age or sex when he participated in the invasion of the Soviet Union. He was reportedly responsible for 14,000 deaths.8 The CIA precursor, OSS, urged President Roosevelt to save Nazis like Barbie for U.S. intelligence work. By the late 1940s, CIA director Allen Dulles and fellow CIA associates, particularly Reagan/Bush’s future CIA director William Casey, worked on transporting thousands of Nazis to Latin America under Operation Sunrise and similar plans. Operation Paperclip was another plan that saved Nazi scientists, and worked in part through a front group directed by Casey—the International Refugee Committee in New York.9 In 1947, these CIA-backed groups helped transport Barbie to Latin America.10 By the late 1960s, U.S. intelligence had done everything it could to counter the socialist political developments in various Latin American countries.

When such methods failed to stop leftists from winning elections, U.S. intelligence orchestrated coups of the democratically elected leaders who had socialist-leaning economic policies. In this they had the important help of their U.S. placed Nazi allies.11 Shock Doctrine, along with books by professors Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman, detailed the CIA’s plot against elected Chilean president Salvadore Allende, who wanted to “nationalize” major resources in Chile, taking them from multinational corporations and giving them back to Chileans.13 The CIA and U.S. military used the generals they had trained and kept on their payroll to launch a coup against Allende’s government on September 11, 1973.14 In the days following the coup, General Augusto Pinochet and his military henchmen arrested 13,500 civilians in Santiago, tortured “subversives” and traveled the country with death squads.15 how the U.S. financed and trained General Pinochet and his military units.16 New York Times articles disclosed declassified State Department and CIA documents that depicted U.S. intelligence aid in Operation Condor’s history of political assassinations of Latin American leftists. Condor dispatched “death squads to kill critics at home and overseas. [Murder] victims included government officials ousted in United States-supported military coups, trade unionists, rights advocates and suspected socialists.”17 Two key CIA-paid assets FBI documents said Condor had several phases. Phase III murderously targeted “leaders especially feared for their potential to mobilize world opinion or organize broad opposition to the military states.” This would include Chile’s top folk singer, Victor Jara. Famed Chilean author Isabel Allende, Salvador’s niece, believes that the Chilean military also hastened the death of Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda. She said that Neruda was a Communist and had considered running for president.19 Another aspect of the Chilean-based Condor involved the Nazi intelligence enclave found there, called Colonia Dignidad. In 2005, the New York Times reported that a post-Pinochet government had arrested and was investigating a World War II Nazi doctor, Paul Schäfer, who founded the enclave in 1961. The enclave had several hundred German residents, a close partnership with the Pinochet dictatorship, intelligence files on political dissidents, an army’s worth of military equipment, and underground torture chambers as part of Condor operations.20 By 2006, Chile put Paul Schäfer on trial and convicted him of working with Pinochet’s military and intelligence services to kidnap and torture leftists, along with sexually abusing twenty-six young boys.21 Other researchers reported how the Dignidad community was “a state within a state.” It had its own airport, a locus for gun and drug trafficking, and could limit which planes were allowed to fly into its airspace.

SS commandos and spies facilitated Schäfer’s reign, which followed MK-Ultra techniques in keeping many in its community drugged. The Nazi spies secretly taped sex parties with prominent Chileans and its drugged youth in order to blackmail them.22 DINA Chief Manuel Contreras admitted that General Pinochet and his son were central to the manufacture and trafficking of cocaine in the region.23 In this regard, Pinochet followed the right-wing dictators propped up by former Nazis throughout the region. The CIA’s Operation Sunrise extended to most of the eight Condor-linked countries. The New York Times article on Chile’s Nazi enclave supports other evidence that the CIA helped them direct the death-squad fascism in other Condor countries. Klaus Barbie’s years in Bolivia exemplified this.24 CIA director Allen Dulles had helped smuggle some 5,000 Nazi Gestapo and SS agents to South America. Archival records show that the CIA-precursor OSS falsely claimed Nazis Adolph Eichmann, Joseph Mengele, and Klaus Barbie had died in the 1940s. In fact, Israelis kidnapped Eichmann from Argentina and put him on trial in Israel in 1961. U.S. intelligence had helped Auschwitz’s “Angel of Death” Mengele and Barbie both gain safe passage to South America.25 It made sense that U.S. intelligence made Argentina the other founding center for Operation Condor’s drug trafficking and genocide, as U.S. intelligence first helped transport many of these Nazis there.26 Several veteran journalists published the controversial investigative conclusion that U.S. and British intelligence helped Adolph Hitler and his wife Eva Braun escape to Argentina. A 2011 London Daily Mail article summarized the investigation of television journalist (Reuters, BBC) Gerrard Williams and veteran military historian Simon Dunstan in their book, Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolph Hitler. The article also summarized Argentinean journalist Abel Basti’s 2003 book, Hitler in Argentina. Italian journalist Patrick Burnside wrote Hitler’s Escape, which is being made into a movie. These researchers presented documents and eyewitness interviews backing their claims that Hitler died in Argentina in the 1960s.27 gentine Nazis in his book Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile.

Subsequently, they relocated to their new Latin American countries of Para- guay and Bolivia, respectively, to carry out their drug trafficking and coups. Manning found that Bormann’s home in Argentina was part of a network of estates owned by at least eighty-two families, averaging 120,000 acres each—the largest landowners in South America. The Nazi enclave’s World War II bounty and subjugation of Latin America helped prop up the American and German oligarchies.29 The New York Times stated, “As many as 30,000 people are thought to have been killed or disappeared,” during Argentina’s “Dirty War” years from 1976 to 1983. This article also emphasized that the dictatorship printed a list of names of artists and intellectuals deemed to have subversive leanings. This list totaled nineteen pages and included novelist Julio Cortazar and folk singer Mercedes Sosa.30 This targeting of musicians in Chile and Argentina parallels similar targeting of musicians in the U.S. Nazi-run German communities aided drug trafficking in many of the Operation Condor participating countries. A New York Times article recounted how notorious Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele moved from Argentina to Paraguay in 1959, living in a Nazi colony, Hohenhau. A right-wing dictator of German descent, Alfredo Stroessner, ruled Paraguay. Mengele then moved to Brazil before he died in 1979.31 In 1985, the Associated Press published the article “War Criminal Mengele Linked to Drug Trafficking,” based on declassified CIA documents regarding Mengele’s drug activity in Latin America in the 1970s.32 Paraguayan intelligence documents found in 1993 detailed how President Stroessner worked with the CIA and the community of Nazis in Paraguay’s southern region in the 1970s.33 Nazi Klaus Barbie directed CIA-supported operations in Bolivia. As a U.S. intelligence asset, Barbie helped coordinate six top drug lords in the overthrow of the government, in what the media dubbed as the first “Cocaine Coup,” in 1980. Barbie directed security and aided the cocaine trafficking. Covert Action, a magazine started by CIA whistleblower Phil Agee, published a photo of a Nazi flag planted atop a Bolivian mountain at the time of that coup.34 By 1975, Juan Alberto Melgar Castro had become President of Honduras. A coup by General Policarpo Paz Garcia ousted him in 1978. Researchers Peter Dale Scott and Jonathan Marshall said the rise of Paz Garcia cemented the power of the cocaine lords in Honduran politics. Even before this coup, “Honduras was a transfer point for half a billion dollars’ worth of drugs bound for the United States each year.” After the coup, Honduras became “the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Central America.” The CIA “relied totally on the cocaine-trafficking", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:214:fb5c5406beb0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3499, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 215, "text": "Honduras.

Even before this coup, “Honduras was a transfer point for half a billion dollars’ worth of drugs bound for the United States each year.” After the coup, Honduras became “the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Central America.” The CIA “relied totally on the cocaine-trafficking military of Honduras to back its plans to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.” First, the CIA-backed Frente Democratico Nicaraguense Contras were based in Honduras as they tried to overthrow the socialist Sandinista regime. A U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee report stated that Oliver North, who worked for the National Security Council starting in 1981 and as a U.S. Lieutenant Colonel in 1983, had set up the Contras’ bank accounts. DEA Agent Thomas Zepeda, stationed in Honduras in 1981, documented the work of high-ranking Honduran military officers in drug trafficking. In this way, Honduran drug trafficking would help fund U.S. intelligence’s war on other Latin American democracies. 36 Research uncovered the ways in which U.S. intelligence waged secret wars on people worldwide, but particularly in Latin American countries in the 1980s. In many Latin American countries, peoples’ movements arose in a struggle to change their governments and their lives for the better; these included Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama, among others labeled “banana republics.”37 Companies like Chiquita and Standard Fruit pushed U.S. intelligence to help them keep their workers’ wages low. These workers wanted to change their governments and gain control over their own fruit production. U.S. intelligence aided corrupt governments in drug trafficking to keep the populace under control and raise money to fight those rebelling against their policies. In 1954, when Guatemala had elected a left-wing democratic president, Jacobo Arbenz, United Fruit (its name later changed to Chiquita) pressured the U.S. government to engineer a coup. Many American officials “had a family or business connection to the company itself,” while other Western corporations owned large amounts of various Guatemalan resources. United Fruit also funded paramilitary death squads there over the years.38 CIA documents admitted backing a coup against Arbenz in 1954. CIA Director Allen Dulles orchestrated the round up of all suspected Communists in Guatemala, beginning a decades-long murderous political purge. From 1954 to 1990, the Guatemalan military was responsible for 100,000 deaths and 40,000 disappearances.39 Other so-called banana republics had lesser, though similar deaths and disappearances.

Researcher Rensselaer Lee stated that at one point the Medellin and Cali crime syndicates of Colombia exported sixty to seventy percent of all cocaine sold in the United States. He added that, while these syndicates were certainly focused on making money, they had a political agenda that included “selectively persecuting the Colombian left.”40 While most people don’t see marijuana as a dangerous drug, U.S. intelligence appeared to have several uses for it. It has been shown that a percentage of people develop marijuana abuse or dependence that could sidetrack productive achievement of higher goals such as antiwar activism. Also, the trafficking of marijuana provided more covert funds when, for example, a Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress cut off aid to brutal, rightwing Latin American governments in the new millennium. Mexico launched its own Operation Condor with CIA aid. It purported to go after drug traffickers, but only arrested poor farmers growing marijuana on tiny plots and those suspected of political organizing in the countryside. The State Department and CIA sent seventy-six airplanes and $115 million in aid for the aerial spraying of crops, though they carefully avoided all the large marijuana crops of drug chiefs.43 Another operation was “La Pipa” (The Pipe). The Mexican Security Organization, DFS, closely collaborated with current and “former” CIA agents on that operation in the late 1970s. DFS bought 600 tanker trucks, ostensibly for transporting natural gas from the U.S. to Mexico. DFS men packed the trucks with Mexican dealers’ marijuana, running ten to twelve trucks a day into Phoenix and Los Angeles. Several Mexican and U.S. customs officials were bribed $50, 000 a load to let the trucks pass. DFS also oversaw a $5 billion marijuana plantation in the province of Chihuaha.44 Another key group of CIA allies in Latin America were Cuban exiles. The Justice Department’s Operation Eagle rounded up many CIA-trained Cubans as part of a drug trafficking syndicate in 1970, but saw their cases dropped on technicalities. Among them, Mario Escandar, Frank Castro, Ricardo Morales and others had long active careers in connection with the CIA. Frank Castro cofounded an anti-Communist group of twenty members called CORU. Ricardo Morales became a high-ranking officer in Venezuela’s intelligence service DISIP, where he gave sanctuary to some CORU members.45 Ricardo Morales and CORU members took credit for exploding a bomb on a Cuban passenger jet, along with fifty other bombings in Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina in the first ten months of CORU’s existence. In an interview with CBS News, CORU member Armando Lopez Estrada said, “We use the tactics that we learned from the CIA … [we] are trained to set off a bomb, we were trained to kill.”46", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:216:995f59e49359", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3501, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 217, "text": "gave sanctuary to some CORU members.45 Ricardo Morales and CORU members took credit for exploding a bomb on a Cuban passenger jet, along with fifty other bombings in Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina in the first ten months of CORU’s existence. In an interview with CBS News, CORU member Armando Lopez Estrada said, “We use the tactics that we learned from the CIA … [we] are trained to set off a bomb, we were trained to kill.”46 Scott and Marshall said financing for CORU came from WFC, a Floridabased financial conglomerate and drug-trafficking front that worked with the Restoy-Escandar-Trafficante organization. The researchers also quoted an unpublished congressional staff study saying the WFC corporation was involved in “political corruption, gun running, as well as narcotics trafficking on an international level.” A CIA-trained Bay of Pigs veteran led the WFC. And, a Florida official directing an investigation of WFC found that one company subsidiary was “nothing but a CIA front.”47 After a socialist revolutionary group, the Sandanista Liberation Front (FSLN), overthrew Nicaragua’s Somoza in 1979, they won many international awards for their work on behalf of the masses of Nicaraguan people regarding health care for all, childcare, unions and land reform. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) gave the FSLN-led Nicaraguan government an award for miraculously decreasing the country’s illiteracy rate from over fifty percent down to thirteen percent in only five months. They also won three other UNESCO awards in the 1980s.48 The CIA immediately organized a warring army against the Sandanistas’ socialist Central American government. Frank Castro (no relation to Cuban leader Fidel) and four other CORU members joined the Nicaraguan opposition that the CIA continually aided—the Contras. As previously noted, the Contras were based in Honduras. Honduran military sources told American reporters that an airline company called SETCO was, “set up by the CIA to carry Contra forces and supplies.” U.S. Senator John Kerry led a panel that issued a report stating, “One of the pilots … for SETCO was Frank Moss … who has been under investigation as an alleged drug trafficker since 1979.”49 This paralleled the CIA’s use of Air America to traffic drugs during the Vietnam War. 1 Jon Lee Anderson, Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life (New York: Grove Press, 1997).

Che also got his message out by writing books. In one essay, he described how capitalist propaganda portrayed Rockefeller as successful. “The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of a Rockefeller, and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails, are left out.” This essay ended with his most famous quote: “At the risk of sounding sappy, the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love”: letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of Marcha a radical weekly published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as “From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today” (12 March 1965); also published in Verde Olivo, the magazine of the Cuban armed forces “Socialism and Man in Cuba,” variant translation by Margarita Zimmermann. Che Guevara also talked about the Northern Hemisphere countries exploiting the Southern Hemisphere countries. In that speech Che supported North Vietnam and urged developing countries to take up arms and create “one, two, three, many Vietnams”; Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara, ed.

Huey Newton and Bobby Seale officially registered the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense as a political organization. The “Self Defense” strategy was a response to the rampant racist police brutalization of their black Oakland community that they experienced personally. They called for gun possession by civilians for defense against police. Newton was taking law classes at the time and instructed Panthers on the law. He led them in countering local police brutality incidents by having his Panthers surround the police with guns pointed while he recited the brutality victim’s legal rights.2 The Black Panthers further had a socialist “free services for the poor” philosophy that they outlined in a “Ten Point Plan.” They enacted their Ten Point Plan through free breakfast programs for poor children, free health clinics, and free political education programs. In 1970 their national newspaper had a circulation of 125,000 copies a week. 3 The Panthers’ political education taught their members about changing society to change their situation. They based their teachings on books by writers like black liberation theorist Franz Fanon, Chinese revolutionary Communist leader Mao Zedong and Cuba’s socialist revolutionary Che Guevara, along with speeches by Malcolm X. Newton, Seale and later Panther leaders required a lot of reading by incoming members.4 Huey Newton and Bobby Seale impressed a number of national black activists and writers, and influenced them to join the Panthers.

Best-selling author Eldridge Cleaver, who worked as editor of the San Francisco-based Ramparts magazine, joined the Panthers as their Minister of Information in 1967.5 That year, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton made Student National Coordinating Committee leaders Stokely Charmichael and H. Rap Brown honorary Panther leaders on the East Coast. Other SNCC members began starting Panther chapters in Chicago and eastern cities.6 The Black Panther Party’s goal of economic power for minorities and the poor posed a threat to the capitalist oligarchy. The oligarchy’s foot soldiers, the cliques of U.S. intelligence’s real leadership, waged war on leftist groups in general, though they used particularly murderous tactics against the Black Panthers through the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program.7 In the days after Martin Luther King’s 1968 assassination, in Oakland, California, a city with one of the country’s largest urban African-American populations, the Black Panthers successfully quelled rioting. They feared police would use rioting as an excuse to murder national Panther leaders. Despite this, police quickly found a way to set up the shooting of Eldridge Cleaver and shot what some said were thousands of bullets into the home where Cleaver and Bobby Hutton cowered. During a lull in the shooting barrage, Cleaver came up with a plan. He suggested they both take off all their clothes and go out of the house naked so police couldn’t use the excuse that they were concealing weapons and shoot them. Cleaver, already wounded, came out naked and survived. The more modest Hutton came out shirtless and was quickly shot dead.8 he Black Panthers evolved into a vanguard organization that had a “no T drugs” policy and had some leaders that had formerly led large gangs. The year after Bobby Hutton was killed by police, authorities initiated a string of successful assassinations beginning with Los Angeles Black Panther leader Alprentice “Bunchy” Carter and his coleader, Jon Huggins. Carter had previously led the 5,000-strong Slauson gang.9 Former L.A. FBI Cointelpro agent Wes Swearingen described his unit’s murderous machinations against Carter and Huggins. He said the FBI paid undercover agents in the United Slaves Organization, a Black cultural nationalist group, to murder the two leaders. The killers, reportedly George and Larry Stiner, shot them on the UCLA campus in January of 1969.10 Tackwood testified to this before a Senate intelligence committee, and he passed a polygraph test.12 After the Carter and Huggins murders, the FBI’s undercover agents inside the United Slaves murdered four more Black Panthers, including John Savage.

Savage witnessed the United Slaves murder of Carter and Huggins and was scheduled to testify soon after.13 Swearingen verified claims that the FBI then engineered the prison break of several United Slaves murderers.14 And, New Haven Panther George Edwards said he acquired a U.S. intelligence document reporting Karenga’s meetings with Governor Ronald Reagan, funding by the Rockefellers, and the Stiners’ work with U.S. intelligence.15 Huggins and Carter had left a tape saying if anything happened to them, they wanted Panther Elmer “Geronimo” Pratt to take over as L.A. Panther leader, and he did.16 Years later, Pratt said the United Slaves organization shouldn’t be held accountable for the FBI agent infiltrators who carried out the Panther murders. Pratt, who later changed his last name to Ji Jaga, said that new Panther Elaine Brown was an undercover agent who started the conflict leading to the Carter and Huggins murders, and that the Stiners of the United Slaves were falsely accused of involvement (Panthers George Edwards and Kathleen Cleaver also support Pratt’s take on Elaine Brown’s undercover agent role).17 FBI whistleblower Swearingen supported Pratt in many ways, though he disagreed about Pratt’s assessment of the Stiners’ innocence in the murders. Swearingen said that an FBI agent named Eric Galt arranged the Stiners’ murder of Carter and Huggins, and that “Darthard Perry, a selfadmitted and publicly acclaimed informer for the FBI, filed an affidavit in a Black Panther Party lawsuit against the government, charging he knew the United Slaves members responsible for the murders of the Panthers were FBI informers.”18 While Pratt’s account may be held in higher regard than all others, and whether the United Slaves were a U.S. intelligence-created group or not, many agree about the FBI’s orchestration of the murders.19 Evidence also indicates that the FBI used undercover agents in the United Slaves to target both the New York and Los Angeles Panthers. FBI informant D’Arthard Perry said that the FBI used United Slaves infiltrator Claude Hubert to kill several L.A. Panthers and then transferred him to New York City.20 On January 17, 1969, the day United Slave FBI infiltrators murdered L.A. leaders Carter and Huggins, police shot at Bronx Panther leader Sekou Odinga.21 Around this same date, undercover police agent Ralph White shot a gun in the Black Panther office, within several feet of Harlem leader Lumumba Shakur.22 The police officers’ shooting at Odinga and Shakur were part of the FBI Cointelpro attacks against the New York Panthers.23 New York prosecutors indicted Lumumba Shakur, his wife Afeni (rap icon Tupac’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:226:8ba623f32f60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3511, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 227, "text": "January 17, 1969, the day United Slave FBI infiltrators murdered L.A. leaders Carter and Huggins, police shot at Bronx Panther leader Sekou Odinga.21 Around this same date, undercover police agent Ralph White shot a gun in the Black Panther office, within several feet of Harlem leader Lumumba Shakur.22 The police officers’ shooting at Odinga and Shakur were part of the FBI Cointelpro attacks against the New York Panthers.23 New York prosecutors indicted Lumumba Shakur, his wife Afeni (rap icon Tupac’s mother), Odinga and nineteen other leading Panthers for planning to bomb and shoot at police precincts and public places around New York.24 These proved to be fantastical charges with no merit, but kept many of the New York Panther leaders in jail for up to two years. Despite the government keeping the New York Panther 21 in jail for a trial that dragged on for two years, a record amount of time in New York state history up to that period, the jury deliberated for approximately two hours to find the defendants not guilty of all the charges.25 While U.S. intelligence targeted members of the Black Panther national leadership early on, a question remains about whether they orchestrated large-scale murderous operations against Panther leaders who could politicize urban youth and gangs in major cities. Did they first focus on Bunchy Carter due to fears about his former leadership of the 5,000-strong Slauson gang and his potential to politicize them?26 At least one historian, University of Southern California Professor Laura Pulido, interviewed people who said Carter led many Slauson gang members to convert to activist Panthers. One interviewee said, “What happened in Los Angeles was a unique experience … What [Carter] did was make his gang [the Panthers] the only gang.” Pulido said that because so many of the Panthers were “underground” or hid their membership, estimates of the Southern California Panther chapter membership “ranged from five hundred to several thousand.”27 Afeni Shakur had formerly led the Disciples Debs gang of girls. Lumumba Shakur had led the Bishops gang and Sekou Odinga had been part of the Sinners gang.28 Were they partly attacked on such a huge scale because of fears over their converting many former gang members into activist Panthers? Whether they were or not, Malcolm X envisioned this potential in referring to urban youth in their teens and twenties as “Black social dynamite.”29 He organized the Rainbow Alliance of leftist groups: Students for a Democratic Society, the Hispanic Young Lords, and the Panthers. Hampton was an inspirational speaker, firing up his audiences with statements such as: “You can kill the liberator but you can’t kill liberation.”30 Possibly the most important concern was Hampton’s ability to appeal to Chicago’s gang leaders.

Hampton convinced Chicago’s largest gang, the U.S. intelligence may have been particularly concerned about the merger of the Blackstone Rangers and the Panthers, because of the Panthers’ no-drugs policy. The Blackstone Rangers were said to be involved in drug dealing. Stopping their involvement would have provided a major blow to the money laundered by local banks and corporations.32 FBI undercover agents and tactics sabotaged the Blackstone Rangers joining with the Panthers. These FBI agents also sabotaged Hampton’s progress with Chicago’s Vice Lords gang.33 By October of 1969, various FBI Cointelpro units had successfully acted on FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s goal of “neutralizing” the Black Panther national leadership. Police and FBI had shot and arrested Panther national cofounder Huey Newton in 1967. They arrested Panther national cofounder Bobby Seale for the Chicago Democratic Convention “police riot” in 1969, and again in New Haven, Connecticut that year.34 Court transcripts suggest that the FBI orchestrated Hampton’s murder on December 4, 1969. The night before, FBI undercover agent William O’Neil had slipped a substantial dose of the tranquilizer, secobarbital, into the drinks of Chicago Black Panther leaders Hampton and Southern Illinois Panther leader Mark Clark during dinner. Hampton’s mother said he passed out mid-sentence while he was in bed talking to her on the phone that night.36 At 4 : 30A.M. ., the FBI and police led a brutal raid on Hampton’s home that left him murdered in his sleep. The police intelligence unit had obtained a floor plan from Panther infiltrator William O’Neal. Court transcripts indicate that police kicked in the townhouse door and shot Mark Clark fatally in the chest. They shot unarmed Panther Brenda Harris, and pumped forty-two bullets through the wall of Hampton’s bedroom and into his bed’s headboard. Court testimony revealed police fired a submachine gun at the remaining Panthers, who tried to cover themselves.37 Hampton’s wife, pregnant Panther Deborah Johnson, along with two other Panthers, failed to rouse the unconscious Panther leader as dozens of bullets came through the walls of their bedroom. Police then shot Hampton in his bed. They shot Hampton twice more in the head at pointblank range.38 In all, the police injured many in firing at least eighty-two shots, while a shot fired by Clark was the only round fired by the Panthers during the raid, and only one policeman was even slightly wounded. Even Clark’s shot was said to be an unconscious response that his drugged body made when police shot him while he was passed out on security duty holding his shotgun.

Even Clark’s shot was said to be an unconscious response that his drugged body made when police shot him while he was passed out on security duty holding his shotgun. Police arrested the surviving Black Panther members on charges of aggravated assault and attempted murder.39 FBI cover-up, media discrepancies and a lawsuit ensued. A Chicago Tribune editor considered a “friend of the FBI” presented the Chicagopolice version of the raid being conducted out of self-defense. Only later did another media outlet show that photos supporting the police story, one of being shot at, were fabricated.40 FBI luminary Richard G. Held took over the Chicago FBI office at this time and supervised the cover-up.41 The survivors sued the Chicago police and FBI. It took fourteen years of appeals and arbitration to win a $1.85 million settlement. Police failed to keep Newton and Seale imprisoned for long, but attacks continued. On October 27, 1967, the last night of Newton’s probation for a 1964 conflict, one of a long line of bizarre shootings involving Panthers occurred. An Oakland police officer with a list of Black Panther license plates pulled over the car Newton was driving. Another police car followed him. While accounts differ on the details of what happened, a shoot-out ensued that left one officer dead, another officer and Newton wounded. Newton left the scene for a hospital, where police soon found, beat and jailed him. Details of the incident support Newton’s claim of not having a gun when police shot him.44 U.S. intelligence continued its war on Black Panther leadership. While Panther cofounders had originally barred the use of drugs, the attitude changed with the huge use of marijuana among youth. However, no reports have been found of Panthers receiving drug-dealing charges in the early years of the organization. CIA agent John Stockwell said the CIA waged psychological warfare on Huey Newton from the time he left prison until his death. Reports support this. Various CIA undercover agents tried to get close to Newton. One, Earl Anthony, said he worked for the FBI and CIA as an undercover agent in the Black Panthers, using cocaine around Newton, and trying to sell him bulk weed.46 Bobby Seale said Newton started selling cocaine at this time. Newton claimed he wasn’t involved in heavy drugs, and cited the FBI’s failed attempts to arrest him for drugs.47 Several sources claim Panther Elaine Brown helped get Newton using cocaine. L.A. Panther leader Geronimo Pratt said Newton told him in 1988 that when he first got out of prison in 1970, Brown, “kept cocaine and sexy women on him everyday/night.”48 Evidence supports Pratt’s allegation that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:229:c48ccb6d51be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3514, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 230, "text": "to sell him bulk weed.46 Bobby Seale said Newton started selling cocaine at this time.

Panther leader Geronimo Pratt said Newton told him in 1988 that when he first got out of prison in 1970, Brown, “kept cocaine and sexy women on him everyday/night.”48 Evidence supports Pratt’s allegation that Brown, previously mentioned as being associated with the Los Angeles Black Panthers before becoming Huey Newton’s lover, was an undercover agent.49 Evidence supports claims that U.S. intelligence further orchestrated the murder of writer and Panther “Field Marshal” George Jackson by prison guards after he was trying to escape from San Quentin prison. Jackson was originally convicted of a $70 armed robbery when he was eighteen. He became highly radicalized during his imprisonment. Professor Angela Davis headed his defense committee, and he wrote a book, Blood in My Eye. 51 Regarding Huey Newton and Elaine Brown, Geronimo Pratt reported Newton told him it took many months for him to come out of his drug and sex euphoria that Brown had cultivated, and realize he was surrounded by agents. Newton said he first began to suspect that Brown was an agent when it came out during Pratt’s trial that Brown’s name was on a receipt from a paint shop that changed the color of Pratt’s car to implicate Pratt in a murder of which he was falsely accused. When the court overturned Pratt’s case twenty-seven years later, the government settled with Pratt for $4.5 million in a false imprisonment lawsuit. Newton also said Brown testified against the United Slaves members who weren’t the ones who pulled the trigger on murdered former Panther leaders Carter and Huggins. Newton said he became convinced she was an FBI asset and had fellow Panthers take custody of Brown, but his “advisors” eventually got her back and involved in the Panthers against his wishes.52 Another point of evidence supporting Elaine Brown’s possible work for U.S. intelligence was her relationship with Jay Richard Kennedy before she joined the Black Panthers. A Pulitzer Prize-winning book, David Garrow’s Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, named J.R. Kennedy as a top CIA informant. Released CIA documents back this claim, as does the King family lawyer William Pepper in his book Orders to Kill. Brown said that before Newton, Jay Kennedy had been her lover for two years.53 The CIA documents, Brown’s incidental disclosures, and whistleblower reports give additional credence to Brown’s possible U.S. intelligence work. In the 1990s, Brown cited Jay Kennedy as a lifelong mentor, despite reports on his CIA connection having appeared in the mid-’80s.54 Jay Kennedy was verified as a CIA-supported writer who infiltrated the civil rights movement early in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:230:0b177b34c3b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3515, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 231, "text": "lawyer William Pepper in his book Orders to Kill.

One of his positions was as a manager for entertainer Harry Belafonte, a longtime MLK supporter. Belafonte later fired Kennedy when his suspicions grew about Kennedy’s true allegiance.55 Elaine Brown went on to lead the only still active section of the Black Panthers, in Oakland. She had them endorse Jerry Brown in his successful run for governor in 1974. She also lectured, wrote books and wrote a newspaper column. Her negative reflections on Huey Newton in A Taste of Power: A Black Woman’s Story contradict accounts by Afeni Shakur and Kathleen Cleaver. Many other books on the Panthers also contradict Brown’s accounts.56 RUVEDFORRELEASE1992 Elaine Brown’s later statements and activist work provide additional clues to her real motives. In a 2003 lecture, she rejected the notion of many undercover agents infiltrating the Panthers, even though a significant number of them had openly testified against the Panthers in trials, and further evidence showed there were many others. Brown also unsuccessfully sued Geronimo Pratt (now Geronimo Ji Jaga) and Kathleen Cleaver for libel regarding these accusations in 2008. Brown’s defenders might say her work of heading the Oakland Panthers when Newton fled the country in the ′70s , her work on behalf of prisoners, and her writing on behalf of black For public relations’ sake, the FBI officially ended their Counterintelligence Program in 1971, after activists broke into an FBI office and stole thousands of documents revealing it.58 However, former Cointelpro agent Wes Swearingen said the FBI continued the program under different names.59 Various judges who oversaw trials of black activists agreed that an FBI/police Cointelpro continued.60 Through all their travails, the Black Panthers did receive some help from many citizens of all ethnicities, including white celebrities. Among them were actors Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Jean Seberg and Marlon Brando. Brando, upon hearing of MLK’s assassination, immediately asked his assistant to call the Panthers’ Los Angeles office and made a speech at a rally on their behalf. New York Symphony orchestra leader, and writer of West Side Story’s music, Leonard Bernstein held benefit parties for the Black Panthers in New York. These celebrities helped the Panthers raise money for their legal defense committees.61 U.S. intelligence repressed American leftists as their agents pushed Echols said heroin became a regular part of the San Francisco music scene as early as 1965, when Joplin and many others “turned to heroin to help them come down”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:231:1d146c1558ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3516, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 232, "text": "a rally on their behalf.

Organized-crime figures such as the Genovese mafia family, who worked with U.S. intelligence from at least World War II trafficking heroin, also worked closely with top jazz club owner and publisher Morris Levy. The top black jazz musicians who played regularly in his club, such as Charlie “Bird” Parker, got hooked on heroin and also served as role models in their communities. Other jazz greats who got hooked on heroin include Billie Holliday and Miles Davis.62 The trafficking of heroin from the Golden Triangle into American cities increased tenfold during the 1960s, in seeming proportion to the increase in anti-War and black radical activism. A U.S. narcotics agent summarized this in respect to the amount of heroin coming into New York. He said, “In 1961 when we … seized fifteen kilos there was street panic in New York City. Junkies were lined up in front of doctors’ offices begging for the stuff.… Now [in 1971] we seize five hundred kilos in three weeks, and it has no effect whatsoever.”63 In 1971, a CIA leak to the New York Times reported that laboratories in the Golden Triangle region around Vietnam produced more than enough tons of Western-grade heroin a year to satisfy the ten tons of heroin Americans consumed annually.64 Americans living in black urban communities reported a sudden flood of heroin into their neighborhoods. Crime skyrocketed as junkies stole to support their heroin habits. Suburban and small-town American streets soon succumbed to this scourge, as heroin use filtered down to their “safe” white neighborhoods. Peter Arnett of the Associated Press reported that heroin “flooded America in the late 1960s, causing the first nationwide epidemic.”65 150 suspects around the country. Its aforementioned Operation Eagle was deemed “the largest roundup of major drug traffickers in the history of federal law enforcement.” Mitchell said these wholesalers handled “about 30% of all heroin sales” and about ^(α)80% of all cocaine sales in the United States.”66 Reviewing Operation Eagle, University of California-Berkeley Professor Peter Dale Scott and State Department researcher Jonathan Marshall found that, “as many as seventy percent of those arrested had once belonged to the Bay of Pigs invasion force.” This was the CIA’s amassed army of Cuban expatriates launched against the socialist government of Cuban revolutionary leaders Fidel Castro and Ernesto “Che” Guevara.

Mario Escandar and other Operation Eagle defendants had their court cases thrown out on a technicality. Escandar “went on to become one of Miami’s most powerful and untouchable traffickers.” Other CIA trainees enjoyed similar status in the drug trade throughout the 1970s.67 American University Professor Clarence Lusane joined Professor Alfred McCoy in reporting that U.S. intelligence supplied drugs to organized crime families who carried out most of the street-level drug dealing. By the later 1960s, the CIA began using other major dealers as well. The first black highlevel drug dealer, Frank Matthews, grossed over $100 million by 1971, with over one hundred people cutting and bagging heroin, and then cocaine, in New York City. Early in 1973, Matthews was arrested. He gained bail and, by that July, left the game, disappearing with his bodyguard, mistress, and $20 million. Lusane stated that a “Top Secret” Justice Department report cited how nine of Matthews’ drug suppliers had their drug importation charges dropped because of their ties to the CIA, illustrating the CIA’s dominance in drug trafficking.68 uerto Rican teenagers founded the Young Lords as a Chicago gang in 1959. Jose “Cha-Cha” Jimenez led the gang in 1964 when they were protecting Latino teens from white ethnic gangs. By 1968, the gang had gotten involved with heroin, cocaine, acid and other drugs. Jimenez was jailed for heroin possession that year. While in jail he read Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Black Panther Party literature. When Jimenez got out of jail, he consulted with Chicago Panther leader Fred Hampton on how to turn the Young Lords into a similar organization as the Panthers, but for the Latino community. Jimenez went to Oakland and shadowed Black Panther national cofounder Bobby Seale for a month. Jimenez ran his Young Lords Organization with similar community organizing activities, such as free breakfast programs for the poor, free health care programs, anti-police brutality programs, women’s rights programs and political education through their own newspaper.69 The Young Lords grew so popular that in 1969 they led a march of 10,000 calling for Puerto Rico’s independence. The FBI’s Counterintelligence Program was targeting the Young Lords at this time. Police arrested Jimenez and other Young Lords multiple times for many false charges, including marijuana possession. Cointelpro later attacked all Young Lords chapters with false arrests, infiltrators and sabotage. In 1975, Jose Cha-Cha Jimenez ran for 46^(th) ward Alderman, as an organizing tactic. Despite only 1000 Latinos registered to vote there, Jimenez won 36% of the vote, with 51%", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:233:d919cfe22140", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3518, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "a march of 10,000 calling for Puerto Rico’s independence.

Despite only 1000 Latinos registered to vote there, Jimenez won 36% of the vote, with 51% needed to win. Also that year, police arrested Jimenez after a protest action he led in support of recently arrested members of FALN, an armed Puerto Rican liberation group that had conducted protest bombings. By 1983, Jimenez had joined with Puerto Rican activist groups that helped gain black politician Harold Washington’s election as Chicago’s mayor. On a June day that year, Jimenez introduced Washington to a Puerto Rican crowd of 100,000. The following day Jimenez and other Latino activists met in the Chicago FBI office with the director to demand that the government stop the mistreatment and torture of jailed FALN. The day after this meeting, a drug dealer assassinated Rudy Lozano, a Mexican activist and fellow Mayor Washington supporter, in his home.70 The Young Lords Organization in Chicago inspired Latino communities nationwide. Young Lords chapters formed in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Bridgeport, Newark, Boston, Los Angeles, San Diego and other cities. A particularly large group formed in New York City. The New York City Young Lords elected Felipe Luciano as their founding chairman. Luciano was also a poet and member of the Last Poets musical group in the 1970s. Many consider them the godfathers of political rap music. Luciano and his Young Lords first surveyed their East Harlem neighborhood for the top problem to work on, and found it was trash not getting picked up. Sanitation services didn’t take care of the poorer neighborhoods like the rest of the city. The Young Lords first tried to clean up neighborhoods themselves. They then built the uncollected garbage into a five-foot tall barricade across Third Avenue in East Harlem and set it ablaze. It stopped traffic and finally brought on improved sanitation services. Among other New York Young Lords actions, they physically took over the First Spanish Methodist Church, providing a free breakfast program inside of it, as well as a clothing program, free health services, day-care services and a liberation school. They took a mobile chest x-ray machine and brought it to where it was more needed. They later took over Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for 12 hours and demanded door-to-door preventive health services, maternal and childcare aid, drug addiction treatment, senior care services, and testing for lead paint poisoning and tuberculosis. They carried out many of these services themselves until they could get the city’s help.71 One Young Lords member, Vincent “Panama” Alba, had a heroin problem as a teenager", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:234:8cc9f7295612", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3519, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 235, "text": "took a mobile chest x-ray machine and brought it to where it was more needed.

She also turned him on to activism.72 Alba played a key role in politicizing the Latin Kings street gang. Other prominent Young Lords leaders included Juan Gonzalez, who had also been part of the Columbia Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Gonzalez later became an award-winning journalist, a longtime columnist for the New York Daily News and a co-host of Democracy Now! Other famous New York Young Lords include longtime television talk show host Geraldo Rivera and Young Lords documentary filmmaker Iris Morales. 1 Another Black Panther Party had started that same year out of Maxwell Stamford and Herman Ferguson’s Revolutionary Action Movement in Philadelphia and New York. While also doing lasting work, they used more discreet tactics and remain lesser known.

Published following Churchill and Vander Wall’s extensively more revealing accounts, Anthony’s book appears as part fact and part subterfuge. Among other undercover agents who got involved with the Oakland Black Panther office, LA Panther Melvin “Cotton” Smith eventually admitted he had been an undercover police intelligence agent. Smith traveled up to Oakland and worked in that Panther office before then traveling to the New York office, where Assata Shakur said he continually tried to get Panthers drinking liquor with him.

Pratt also noted Brown receiving psychiatric treatment at UCLA. Pratt called this a “prerequisite for patsies of Elaine’s type.” This suggests Brown was being manipulated with some kind of MK-Ultra conditioning in a psychiatric hospital and that Pratt had seen others go through this.

Newton wrote his doctoral thesis in 1980, based on his FBI and CIA file. His surviving wife published it in 1991. One FBI document detailed the kind of smear campaign they would attempt on Newton. In Brown’s later memoir, she described Newton’s early ’70s, post-prison apartment as a “twenty-fifth-floor penthouse… [with] many balconies.” An FBI document described how an FBI media collaborator, Ed Montgomery, helped the FBI in one of its “counter-intelligence activities,” smearing Newton with a false report in a front-page San Francisco Chronicle article. The article characterized Newton’s apartment as “luxurious,” in contrast to “the ghetto-like BPP ‘pads’ and community centers.” Other FBI memorandums detailed their intent to carry out this smear campaign. The FBI also created a fake letter from an anonymous Panther they sent from the Oakland Panther office to Panther offices nationwide, complaining about Newton’s alleged luxurious apartment.

Bob Marley and Peter Tosh both grew up in squalid Jamaican homes. They met and formed a singing group called the Wailers in the mid-1960s. By the mid-’70s they broke into the American and British music world as a hot new band playing reggae, a unique sound derived from various elements of music from Black communities worldwide, filtered through Jamaicans’ Rastafarian community influence. Their 1974 Burnin’ album was particularly known for its Black Power songs such as “I Shot the Sheriff,” “Burnin’ and Lootin’,” and “Get Up, Stand Up.” The album’s “Revolution” was a particularly incendiary song in saying there was no political change without revolutionary struggle.1 By 1980, Bob Marley had become a hero for Africans.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:244:2645dc6e944f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3529, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 245, "text": "as a hot new band playing reggae, a unique sound derived from various elements of music from Black communities worldwide, filtered through Jamaicans’ Rastafarian community influence.

He played concerts for leftist leader Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and supported leftist struggles in Angola, Mozambique and South Africa. New York’s Black Liberation Movement-aligned station, WLIB radio, worked to get Marley’s next album, Uprising, nationwide play on mostly politically conservative Black radio.2 n the 1970s, democratic socialist leader Michael Manley took the I office of Prime Minister in Jamaica. Researchers uncovered covert U.S. interventions that included arson, bombing and assassination The U.S. told Prime Minister Manley they weren’t involved in covert actions against the Jamaican government. However, Manley’s forces intercepted at least one shipment containing 500 machine guns that came from a right-wing Jamaican paramilitary faction with CIA roots and leaders convicted of drug trafficking. This right-wing group also reportedly aided the trafficking of cocaine and heroin into Jamaica.3 Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb said that, in 1977, two investigative reporters found the CIA’s Jamaican station chief waged a destabilization program against democratic socialist leader Michael Manley. Cuban Bay of Pigs veteran Luis Posada Carriles helped the CIA make covert shipments of arms to Manley’s opponents and sponsored violence against Manley’s supporters that included bombings, assassinations, inciting labor unrest and giving financial support and bribes to the conservative Jamaican Labour Party. 4 Marley, Peter Tosh and their Rastafarian friends preached that Jamaicans should resist American interventions, and resist using heroin and coke, limiting drug use to marijuana. Although their loyalty generally seemed aligned with Manley’s government, right-wing officers arose within the police department. There is documentation that in 1972 right-wing police officers knocked down Tosh’s door, and in 1975 beat him badly, dislocating several ribs.5 In 1976, when right-wing militia attacks on the government and its allies escalated, the Governor-General of Jamaica declared a state of emergency. Upcoming national elections saw the rise of right-wing militiabacked Edward Seaga as the opposition. Prime Minister Michael Manley said the CIA helped stir up armed unrest due to the upcoming elections. He said government police loyal to him fought this calculated unrest organized by his political opponents. Several writers, including Gary Webb and former CIA agent Philip Agee, documented how the CIA used money, guns and cocaine to undermine Michael Manley’s administration. The CIA station chief in Jamaica, with the help of some opposition groups, began a program that included assassinations. The Jamaican Labour Party and their supportive gangs were part of this cabal.

The CIA station chief in Jamaica, with the help of some opposition groups, began a program that included assassinations. The Jamaican Labour Party and their supportive gangs were part of this cabal. At least one member later claimed he was trained by the CIA to fight political wars for the JLP.6 The CIA’s concern about Bob Marley’s influence in Jamaica increased after his 1976 song “Rat Race” stated, “Rasta don’t work for no CIA!”7 As elections neared, Manley spent several long nights at Marley’s house. The two planned a free concert sponsored by the Jamaican Ministry of Culture just before the elections. The CIA undoubtedly feared Jamaicans would see this as a Marley endorsement of the socialist prime minister. The CIA-backed Jamaican Labour Party’s paramilitary force, the Shower Posse, attacked Marley a week before the concert, holding him at gunpoint, and successfully extorted money from him, an intimidation tactic to get him to withhold any endorsement. Manley’s People’s National Party responded by sending a cadre of gunmen to guard Marley’s home twenty-four hours a day. 8 Then, on the Friday night before the show, at a home where Marley was holding a meeting, Shower Posse gunmen interrupted the meeting by firing a barrage of bullets at the house. One gunman raced to the kitchen and shot at Marley five times. One bullet went through Bob Marley’s chest and arm, but did not kill him. The gunman hit Marley’s manager Don Taylor four times, but he survived. Another bullet from the outside gunmen embedded in the head of Bob’s wife, Rita Marley, and another went into a friend’s stomach. All the victims survived the attack.9 Don Taylor said Rastafarians eventually captured several of the gunmen who shot Marley. When confronted by Marley and Taylor, the attackers confessed. Taylor described the situation: “Three young men were tied and bound in the gully when we arrived. One, a young man I knew only as Leggo Beast, told the ghetto court that four of them had been trained by the CIA and given guns and unlimited supplies of cocaine to do the assassination.”10 After the attack, police and Rastafarians escorted the Marleys and their band members to a secluded mountain encampment. Armed government soldiers and machete-toting Rastas patrolled the encampment, successfully protecting Bob Marley before the concert. Marley appeared at the concert on stage with Prime Minister Manley and Manley’s PNP handedly won the election. However, those present at the encampment said an unarmed right-wing agent, cameraman Carl Colby, attacked Marley in an unforeseen way. Colby’s group was making a film of Marley’s concert.

Unknown to anyone on the film crew, Carl Colby was the son of CIA director William Colby.11 Manager Don Taylor also claimed in his memoirs that a “son of a prominent CIA official” had been planted among the pre-election concert film crew as part of a plan to assassinate Marley. Taylor said he was convinced that “the CIA had been behind the plot to kill Bob Marley due to his possible influence on Jamaican politics and the wider world.” Taylor further said that the U.S. “behind Seaga and the Researcher Alex Constantine interviewed former Black Panther and cinematographer Lee Lew-Lee, who was also a friend of some of the Wailers. Lew-Lee said that Colby brought a new pair of boots for Marley, and Marley immediately tried the boots on, a reported customary gesture of appreciation among Rastafarians when receiving a gift. Sticking his foot in, the singer exclaimed “Oww!” as something jabbed him. Marley pulled out a length of metal wire embedded in the boot. Lew-Lee said he thought nothing of the boot incident at the time but then became suspicious when Marley was playing soccer and broke his toe on that same foot several months after receiving the boots. When the bone wouldn’t mend, doctors found it had cancer. Many suggested the wire in Colby’s gift boots had a carcinogenic chemical compound on it. The cancer eventually spread to Marley’s brain, lungs and liver. 13 CIA documents from its MK-Ultra program detailed the program’s focus on using methylcholanthrene, the most potent known carcinogen, to assassinate its targets.14 On a Jamaican doctor’s advice, Marley traveled to Germany and received treatment for eight months from Dr. Josef Issels, without realizing Issels had previous worked alongside Nazi Dr. Joseph Mengele. Constantine detailed the account of Marley’s mother, Cedella Booker, who described how she visited her son when he was being treated by Issels with a needle. She said Issels “plunged the needle straight into Nesta’s [Marley’s] navel right down to the syringe. Nesta grunted and winced. He could only lie there helplessly, writhing on the table, trying his best to hide his pain.” Issels ridiculed Marley for grimacing, yanked out the needle and strolled casually out of the room.15 In his last days, Marley toured the world, playing shows in pain, and still had run-ins with CIA forces bent on defeating Manley’s democratic socialist party.

CIA operatives made additional threats against Marley if he returned to Jamaica before the 1980 election in which Manley was seeking a third term. The CIA also reportedly used their work inside the Inter-American Press Association to influence the right-wing transformation of the Jamaican Daily Gleaner newspaper. A Drug Enforcement Agency intelligence report said that during the election campaign, political gangs akin to the CIA-backed Shower Posse killed more than 700 people. Manley lost the 1980 election. Bob Marley died of cancer in May of 1981 at the age of thirty-six. Some 30,000 mourners attended his Jamaican wake.16 After that, former Wailer Peter Tosh collaborated with Rolling Stone Mick Jagger. Tosh continued his political message music until 1987, when gunmen who were part of the CIA-backed Jamaican Labour Party murdered Tosh and a friend of his in Jamaica. Tosh’s producer, Wayne Johnson, cited an unnamed Jamaican government official who told him one of the gunmen was a police officer. Journalist Eric Williams reported that Tosh also owned an apartment in New York. Williams said that purported burglars cleared out that apartment, and a NYC public administrator somehow gained possession of Tosh’s master tapes. In a 1994 article, Williams claimed that an administrator hid them in a warehouse for years, barring the public from hearing the political songs of one of the world’s most influential reggae artists.17 Notes 1 Timothy White, Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley (New York: Henry Holt, 1996), pp. 260-61, 268. 2 White, Catch A Fire, pp. 304, 317-18. 3 Ellen Ray and Bill Schaap, “Massive Destabilization in Jamaica,” Covert Action Information Bulletin, no. 10 (August-September 1980), pp. 13, 16; William Blum, The CIA: A Forgotten History (London: Zed Books, 1986), p. 301; Jerry Meldon, “The CIA’s Dope-Smuggling ‘Freedom Fighters,’ Veterans of the CIA’s Drug Wars, Profile: Luis Posada Carriles,” High Times, December 18, 1998.

FBI documents stolen in 1971 show the FBI used their Counterintelligence program to target both groups, but waged particularly brutal attacks on the Black Liberation Movement. 2 A revered family had arisen amongst the East Coast Black Liberation Movement—the Shakurs. El Hajj Sallahudin “Abba” Shakur and his wife gave birth to Lumumba and Zayd Shakur (born Anthony and James Coston). They also adopted and raised Mutulu Shakur, amongst other black children. Abba Shakur was an organizer in Marcus Garvey’s United Negro Improvement Association and later in Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity in New York City, where he was one of several in Malcolm X’s inner circle of confidantes.3 Lumumba, Zayd and Mutulu Shakur joined Malcolm X’s group just before the leader’s death. After that, Lumumba founded the Harlem Black Panther Party chapter. Lumumba’s childhood friend, Sekou Odinga, founded the Bronx Black Panther chapter with Zayd Shakur. Abba and Mutulu Shakur became active in the Revolutionary Action Movement.4 Lumumba Shakur married Afeni Shakur in 1968. In the same year, Mutulu Shakur became a cofounder of the Republic of New Afrika. The RNA was politically aligned with the Panthers, had similar goals and experienced similar police repression. The RNA formed when five hundred grassroots activists from around the country met in Detroit to declare independence for the black nation inside the U.S. The following year, police attacked the RNA convention at Rev. C.L. Franklin’s (father of “Queen of Soul” Aretha Franklin) New Bethel Church in Detroit. Police fired 800 rounds in the church, and held 150 people incommunicado before a judge set up court in the police station and got most of them released.5 In April 1969,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:250:eafcecb73f37", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3535, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 251, "text": "The RNA formed when five hundred grassroots activists from around the country met in Detroit to declare independence for the black nation inside the U.S. The following year, police attacked the RNA convention at Rev.

Police fired 800 rounds in the church, and held 150 people incommunicado before a judge set up court in the police station and got most of them released.5 In April 1969, New York’s police intelligence unit, the Bureau of Special Services, obtained an indictment for the arrest of Lumumba, Afeni, Sekou Odinga, and eighteen other Black Panther leaders who were dubbed the New York 21. Odinga escaped police pursuit on the morning of the New York 21 arrest.6 The imprisoned Black Panthers chose Afeni Shakur to gain release on bail first to speak and raise bail for the other Panthers. The Panthers elected her the new Harlem Panther leader.7 A judge then revoked her bail and she returned to jail. After what was the longest New York court case of its time, a jury acquitted the remaining thirteen Panthers on trial. Several jurors cited Afeni Shakur’s work as her own lawyer for their acquittal of the Panthers in 1971.8 Afeni had become pregnant with another Panther’s child when out on bail in 1970, and Lumumba divorced her. A few months after Afeni’s 1971 court acquittal, she gave birth to Tupac Shakur, the future rap icon.9 By 1973, Afeni moved in with Lumumba’s adopted brother Mutulu Shakur.10 Mutulu Shakur also worked as a political education instructor at Lincoln Detox in the Bronx in the early 1970s. He got a degree in acupuncture by the mid-1970s and used it to successfully treat drug addicts. It still remains the most nationally reknowned center for acupuncture drug treatment training. Mutulu started national acupuncture groups and lectured on the subject worldwide. change the shape and attitude of the brothers and sisters who participated in what we called then, the revolution.

The FBI’s Counterintelligence Program had manufactured this rift between Huey Newton’s Oakland National Panther Office and Panther Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver, then exiled in Algeria. Some New York Panther 21 members aligned themselves with Cleaver. The FBI accomplished this with fake letters and undercover agents. Zayd had gone underground after he felt that FBI undercover agents were threatening his life and he saw some of his fellow Panthers killed. After Sekou Odinga returned to America, he and Zayd started a new militant self-defense group, the Black Liberation Army, which reportedly protected activist leaders from armed police assault by regularly positioning snipers on various black neighborhood rooftop locations.12 Zayd’s close Panther friend, Assata Shakur (born Joanne Chesimard), quit the Panthers because of the New York/Oakland feud. The respect Assata attained among other Panthers led to continued targeting anyway. Seeing her picture on the front page of the Daily News with the notice that she was wanted for questioning about a policeman’s murder scared her into joining Zayd in his underground hideout.13 The FBI started a propaganda campaign against Assata Shakur, calling her “the revolutionary mother hen” of the Black Liberation Army, which was accused of murdering a number of New York City police officers. Most of these accusations came with little evidence and few valid convictions. The FBI conducted a nationwide manhunt for Assata in 1972, and put her on their Most Wanted list with her picture plastered in police precincts and banks as a shoot-to-kill target.14 New Jersey police charged Assata with killing the police officer. The case didn’t reach trial for four years because prosecutors brought Assata to trial six times for alleged involvement in half a dozen other major criminal actions spanning several years. They failed to gain a conviction at any of those venues.16 By 1976, Assata’s lead trial lawyer, Stanley Cohen, reported several breakthroughs in her case, and was found dead from a physical attack soon after, with all his papers stolen.17 At the trial, Assata’s other lawyers presented tests and medical experts to prove her innocence in court. For example, Assata’s fingers tested negative for gun residue, and police shot Assata while she had her hands raised. Doctors said the bullet immediately severed a median nerve that wouldn’t have allowed Assata to pull a trigger. Nonetheless, prosecutors won a conviction against her for killing the police officer during that 1973 stop. 18 Within the next few years, a group labeled the Black Liberation Army’s Multinational Task Force took on a daring operation.

This group reportedly consisted of members from the Weather Underground, the Puerto Rican group the Young Lords, and the Black Liberation Army. They broke Assata Shakur out of prison and helped her gain political exile status in Cuba. She remained there in 2015, despite million dollar bounties being placed on her capture, and having been the first woman placed on the FBI’s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013.19 Mutulu Shakur also cofounded and directed the National Task Force for Cointelpro Litigation and Research.21 Afeni Shakur, Mutulu’s live-in partner, worked with Mutulu on this project. Afeni’s activism particularly focused on a New York City lawsuit started by a wide array of antiwar activists, including Abbie Hoffman. This historic lawsuit accused the New York City police department of violating the legal rights of New York activists with everything from illegal spying to murder.22 After close to a decade, a judge agreed with most of the lawsuit’s charges. The suit’s lead lawyer, Barbara Handschu, helped the group gain the most restrictions on police intelligence of any city nationwide. This forced the NYPD to officially end its police Cointelpro activities.23 However, in the 1980s, the same judge ruled in a later case involving Mutulu Shakur that the NYPD had actually continued its Cointelpro activities.24 By the 1970s, Mutulu Shakur had become the Assistant Director of Lincoln Detox in the Bronx. Others working with Lincoln Detox included Black Liberation movement activists, members of the Latino community’s version of the Panthers, the Young Lords, and white SDS/Weather Underground activists, such as Bernardine Dohrn’s sister, Jennifer Dohrn.25 The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) attributes its birth to Lincoln Detox (later changed to “Lincoln Recovery”). The clinic started after a group of activists formed the United Bronx Drug Fighters to demand drug detox at Lincoln Hospital, which didn’t have it in 1970. At this time clinicians agreed with addicts’ account of having to wait up to a year to get into addiction treatment programs in New York City. While starting with the innovative use of methadone for detox instead of maintenance, both staff and addicts desired a non-drug method of detox. Around late 1973, a Chinese doctor published his findings of acupuncture’s success with opiate detox, and Lincoln Detox began using it with great results. While some research questions acupuncture’s success with addiction, studies out of Yale University and Britain’s top medical journal, The Lancet, support its efficacy.26 NADA cited three key people amongst Lincoln Detox’s rise: Jose Aponte, Mutulu Shakur and Richard Taft, MD.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:253:b8adde5453ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3538, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 254, "text": "methadone for detox instead of maintenance, both staff and addicts desired a non-drug method of detox.

NADA gave details supporting Mutulu Shakur’s description of how conservative forces conducted “lowintensity warfare” against Lincoln Detox. Medical Director Richard Taft began receiving death threats and somebody shot at him, leading him to start carrying a gun. Dr. Taft was then found dead. The NADA description suggested that he was murdered. Mutulu Shakur said somebody tried to make it look like a heroin overdose to discredit the clinic. The drug was found in his skin, but not in his blood. Mutulu said Taft’s was just one of at least several early murders among targeting tactics. Mutulu said that Assata’s lawyer, Stanley Cohen, “the best attorney that the clinic and revolutionaries had,” was found dead in a similar state as Taft, physically attacked and found by the coroner to have an “overdose” of cocaine in him.27 Despite its reported success, Lincoln Detox was defunded by New York City in 1978. The clinic continued without funding. Reports vary on numbers, but estimates of 50-200 police were sent to close Lincoln Detox and physically force Mutulu and other workers out of the Lincoln Hospital area. Mutulu continued his work anyway, founding a national acupuncture group, the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA). He was invited to China, Zimbabwe and Europe to further his work. In an interview decades later, Mutulu described many top activists who took part in BAAANA, but were then targeted by U.S. intelligence. For example, he said that Nehanda Abiodun “is still being hunted by the law, the FBI, CIA, Interpol. She was a sister who helped start BAAANA on 129^(th) St. between 7^(th) and 8^(th) Avenue in Harlem. She was a part of the Republic of New Afrika’s cadre and was one of the first organizers of the New Afrikan People’s Organization.”28 The FBI said Mutulu founded the Black Liberation Army’s Multinational Task Force (MTF).29 Researchers said some MTF members, the multi-ethnic activist group that included Weather Underground members, worked at Lincoln Detox and took extreme measures when the city tried to close it. The government charged the group with robbing banks to support Lincoln Detox when the city barred its funding. The FBI also charged the MTF with breaking Assata Shakur from jail.

A judge convicted members of the MTF on a failed Brinks bank truck robbery in 1981 that killed two police officers and a guard. Police went after Mutulu, not for any involvement in the actual crime, but for being a “co-conspirator.” Mutulu went underground but was caught and brought to trial in 1986. In 1988 he was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.30 Mutulu Shakur remains imprisoned as a purported co-conspirator in the attempted robbery, while other MTF members closely involved have gained their freedom. For example, white Weather Underground member Kathy Boudin sat in the front of the getaway truck with Black Liberation Army members in the back. She was released in 2003 after two decades in prison. Weather Underground member Marilyn Buck was also convicted of involvement in the Brinks truck robbery and Assata’s prison break. She had cancer, was released in July of 2010, and died the following month. White Weather Underground member David Gilbert remains in jail for aiding the Black Liberation Army in that incident.31 Others convicted for that incident, among other charges, include former Black Panther 21 membersturned BLA members Kuwasi Balagoon and Sekou Odinga. Balagoon died in prison in 1986. The courts also convicted Odinga regarding Assata’s prison break. He was released from prison in November of 2014.32 Overall, these radical leftists received hugely disproportionate sentences compared to right-wing radicals. For example, researchers Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wall pointed out how MTF supporters Susan Rosenberg and Tim Blunk were captured at a cache of explosives in 1984 and received unprecedented 58-year prison sentences. In comparison, Dennis Malvesi, a right-wing fanatic convicted of actually using explosives to blow up abortion clinics in the early 1980s, only received a seven-year prison sentence.33 In 1971, New York City had closed its Bureau of Special Services Cointelpro unit but some of the activities continued, according to a federal judge’s report. Police whistleblowers reported working in New York City Police Department’s Protective Research Unit, inside the Intelligence Unit, which they called the “Black Desk,” to spy on political black leaders. Another unit created in 1980 was the Joint Terrorist Task Force that New York and U.S. intelligence started in response to the Black Liberation Army and the Multinational Task Force.

At the end of Mutulu’s trial, the federal district court judge said, “The rights of Mr. Shakur … were violated by the Cointelpro program.”35 Still, Mutulu started serving a sixtyyear sentence in August of 1988 for conspiracy to commit armed robbery and murder, and aiding Assata Shakur’s prison escape. The parole board repeatedly denied parole for Mutulu, partly because he refused to renounce his politics, repeating the pattern of L.A. Panther leader Geronimo Pratt.36 he FBI never stopped targeting Afeni Shakur, probably using agents within their cocaine distribution network for some tasks. Initially, and for many years, the FBI visited Afeni’s job sites and intimidated employers into firing her or not hiring her. Afeni, her son Tupac, and her daughter with Mutulu, Sekyiwa, moved dozens of times, often sleeping on friends’ floors.37 Despite this destitution, Afeni managed to stay politically active in the 1970s and early 1980s. For example, she continued her work on the Handschu lawsuit against New York City.38 Afeni also wrote a chapter of a book, Human Rights for Everybody. The book was co-written by other activists including her ex-husband Lumumba Shakur, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Grace Paley, and Juan Jose Pena.39 The FBI, under the Reagan/Bush administration, had a motive to neutralize Afeni Shakur to stop her successful work in helping restrict New York police intelligence. By 1982, within a year of Mutulu Shakur going underground, a drug dealer named Kenneth “Legs” Saunders entered Afeni’s life. After moving through dozens of homes and homeless shelters, Afeni moved into Legs’s home.40 Legs eased Afeni’s poverty while she tried to raise Tupac and Sekyiwa. Afeni said Legs got her to use crack cocaine. “That was our way of socializing,” she said. “He would come home late at night and stick a pipe in my mouth.”41 Research suggests that U.S. intelligence inserted Legs into beleaguered Afeni’s life. Radio reporter Richard Boyle, who covered the trial of Vietnam Veterans Against the War leaders in the ′70s , found it wasn’t uncommon for U.S. intelligence to use “women or men, to get in personal relationships with their targets.”42 Legs’s connections indicate this was his role in 1982. He was an associate of New York drug lord Nicky Barnes.43 Barnes assisted the first national “Black drug kingpin,” Frank Matthews, who worked untouched for years. As mentioned, the Justice Department indicted Matthews’s entire network in 1973, but dropped charges on nine of them due to their CIA ties. Matthews left the U.S. with millions of dollars.

As mentioned, the Justice Department indicted Matthews’s entire network in 1973, but dropped charges on nine of them due to their CIA ties. Matthews left the U.S. with millions of dollars. Barnes took Matthews’s place from 1973 into the late 1980s. Barnes’s ability to remain jail-free suggested he was either one of the nine with CIA ties or he had similar U.S. intelligence support. Professor Clarence Lusane found Barnes won so many “acquittals on gun, narcotics, bribery and murder charges,” the New York Times called him “Mr. Untouchable.”44 Afeni reportedly relapsed with her cocaine addiction when living in Baltimore from approximately 1984 until 1987. She further used crack cocaine for four years after she moved herself, her son Tupac Shakur, and his half-sister Sekyiwa, to Marin City, outside Oakland, California in 1987. She moved into the home of Geronimo Pratt’s wife, Linda Pratt.46 In 1991 Afeni finally gained long-term sobriety. The wife of another Panther 21 defendant first tricked Afeni into attending inpatient drug treatment.47 Afeni then started attending Narcotics Anonymous (NA) at the urge of the Panther 21 comrade’s adult daughter. She gained her long-term sobriety that year with the help of a sponsor and support network through NA.48 Afeni Shakur’s other activism had included her work on Black Panther Geronimo Pratt’s defense team, which she returned to with her sobriety. Former Los Angeles FBI Cointelpro agent Wes Swearingen and other agents testified that L.A. FBI informants set Geronimo Pratt up on a murder frame-up.49 An FBI-paid lawyer had infiltrated Pratt’s defense counsel, according to the California Attorney General’s office in a declaration filed in court, and the FBI paid another person on Pratt’s defense team. This led to Pratt’s conviction and imprisonment for over 25 years.50 While Afeni Shakur and Geronimo Pratt’s defense team initially failed to have Pratt acquitted, the lawyers did uncover how he had been targeted by joint efforts of the CIA’s Chaos program, and the FBI’s Cointelpro. Pratt’s defense team eventually gained his release from prison. The U.S. awarded Pratt several million dollars as compensation for false imprisonment in 1997.51 Six years later, reporters revealed another example of U.S. intelligence using an undercover agent to exploit the weakness of a black woman activist. In 2003, the New York Times described how an FBI informant became the boyfriend of Malcolm X’s daughter, Qubilah Shabazz, and then ensnared her in a plot to assassinate Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakan. The boyfriend convinced Shabazz that Farrakan plotted against her mother, Betty Shabazz. The article claimed that Betty Shabazz blamed Farrakan for some aspect of Malcolm X’s death.

The boyfriend convinced Shabazz that Farrakan plotted against her mother, Betty Shabazz. The article claimed that Betty Shabazz blamed Farrakan for some aspect of Malcolm X’s death. It’s possible that the boyfriend also contributed to Qubilah Shabazz’s apparent drug problem, as the government agreed to drop the charges if Shabazz agreed to see a psychiatrist and to get drug treatment (the government also switched custody of her 12 year-old son Malcolm to Betty Shabazz).52 As documented earlier, the CIA waged psychological warfare on Black Panther national cofounder Huey Newton his entire life after prison Committee published an admission that as early as 1970 the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency began cooperatively targeting Newton as part of their “Enemy’s List.”54 In one example described earlier, U.S. intelligence appeared to have also used the tactic of an undercover agent acting as a romantic partner and using drugs to undermine an activist when Elaine Brown brought cocaine into Newton’s life just after he came out of prison in 1970.55 The exact extent of Huey Newton’s involvement with cocaine still remains up for debate. National Black Panther cofounder Bobby Seale said he split with Newton by 1973, as Newton had started dealing cocaine by that time. On the other hand, Newton wrote and published his autobiography, Revolutionary Suicide, in 1973, suggesting he was more functional than most full-fledged addicts. Huey Newton also worked towards attaining a doctorate in the 1970s. In his doctoral dissertation, War Against the Panthers, published in 1980, Newton meticulously detailed U.S. intelligence’s unsuccessful attempts to arrest him for drug involvement.56 In War Against the Panthers, Newton also detailed how the FBI tried to kill him in 1973 by having police shoot up the door of his next-door neighbor at 5 a.m. one day. He knew the neighbor was dealing drugs, but only later found out the FBI was paying the neighbor’s rent. Newton believed it was an attempt to lure him into defending the neighbor and getting shot in the process.57 By 1988, Newton had started a Panther-inspired school for children in Oakland, California. That year, police arrested Huey Newton on a minor charge that put him in prison with former Los Angeles Panther leader Geronimo Pratt.58 In prison, Pratt took Newton under his wing while Newton was reportedly in drug withdrawal, and the two compared their intelligence files.

They saw how the FBI and CIA set them against each other and manufactured the war between Newton’s Oakland Office and the New York Panthers, with whom Pratt had been close. On August 22, 1988, the day officials were to release Newton from prison, he chose to remain incarcerated and announced a press conference for the following day. There, he said he wouldn’t leave prison until officials freed Pratt. However, Pratt asked Newton to leave and help him from the outside. 59 Once out, Huey Newton worked with Pratt’s lawyer and made speeches for his release. In the summer of 1989, East Coast Black Panthers had restarted a Black Panther newspaper. Newton called them and said he wanted to reunite and restart the East Coast and West Coast Black Panthers.60 U.S. intelligence reportedly still had Newton under surveillance, and these moves likely contributed to his early death. On August 22, 1989, on the one-year anniversary of Newton’s refusal to leave prison on Geronimo Pratt’s behalf, a gunman murdered Newton in Oakland. A minor conviction for gun possession had left Newton unarmed. The assailant shot Newton three times, including twice in the head as he lay on the ground.61 In addition to its anniversary timing, many other aspects of Newton’s murder suggest it was a U.S. intelligence assassination. The San Francisco Examiner caught Oakland Police Lt. Mike Sims in a number of lies about the murder. When Sims repeatedly said the police had “no suspects, no clues,” the Examiner reported police had been videotaped arresting three men near the scene within minutes of the murder. Sims later said only two were arrested, neither of whom were linked to Newton’s murder. Oakland Police corrected Sims the following day, saying the two were suspects, though they only named and charged one. It is important to note that FBI Special Agent in Charge, Richard Held, spoke with Sims at this press conference.62 The FBI and police claimed the accused shooter, Tyrone Robinson, appeared to have acted in self-defense when Newton pulled a gun after an argument over money he owed Robinson for cocaine. The earlier police statement that they didn’t find a gun belonging to Newton at the scene contradicts this claim. The account also doesn’t explain why the shooter would put two extra bullets in Newton’s head as he lay on the street from the first bullet. As a Special Forces commando described for an unrelated article, putting two extra bullets in the head is a signature move in a combat military execution.63 Witness Michelle Johnson, who lived just across the street from", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:259:05d2860cf663", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3544, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 260, "text": "earlier police statement that they didn’t find a gun belonging to Newton at the scene contradicts this claim.

Johnson heard a brief argument and recognized one of the two men as Huey Newton. The other man ordered Newton into a car. Newton protested, “Man, I ain’t getting in Johnson’s description, along with other aspects of the murder, bolsters the contentions of Newton’s brother and area activists that the FBI murdered Newton.65 Several writers support the accounts of Newton’s close friends who said the police had Newton under constant surveillance. These factors strongly indicate U.S. intelligence set up his assassination.66 The assassination of other black leaders came with similar anniversary or threat timing. Martin Luther King’s family lawyer, William Pepper, made it clear that U.S. intelligence orchestrated Martin Luther King’s assassination exactly one year after he officially announced his opposition to the Vietnam War.67 A gunman assassinated Congo president Laurent Kabila on January 16, 2001, exactly forty years after the U.S. aided the assassination of Kabila’s former comrade, and Congo’s first independently elected president, Patrice Lumumba.68 This tactic offers an implicit warning to those of similar leftist persuasions. 1 “Interview from Lompoc Federal Prison with Tyehimba Jess of WHBK Radio in Chicago,” www.mutulushakur.com/lompoc.html. 2 On Media break-in, Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wall, The COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI’s Secret Wars Against Dissent in the United States (Boston: South End Press, 1991), pp. xi, 332.

An article on former Students for a Democratic Society member Judy Clark said that she had joined the Weather Underground’s Days of Rage, before joining a group called the May 19 Communist Organization. The article described how in the 1970s, The writer said he saw Clark in the 1970s pointedly reprimand a Vietnam War veteran suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Clark said, “You were the invading army. How many did you kill?” At the Brinks truck trial, she told the jury, “Revolutionary violence is necessary, and it is a liberating force.” The article described an incredible transformation Clark made in prison to present herself as a constantly warm and inspirational, but trial statements like this one contributed to her getting a 75-year prison sentence.

They settled into the large Jamaican and Caribbean communities in Miami and New York City. In the early 1980s, the [Shower] Posse leaders … evolved from small time marijuana sellers into nationwide cocaine and crack distributors.”2 In 1983, Vice-President George H.W. Bush ordered Oliver North and the CIA to set up drug shipments from Latin America to the U.S. east coast. North reportedly contracted with the chief cocaine producer in Bolivia that year to airlift over 500 tons of cocaine to the east coast for distribution by a Columbian cartel.3 The Shower Posse members apparently served as some of their lower-level dealers before their roles grew larger in time.

So much information was made public about the CIA paying Nicaraguan Contras and aiding them in the trafficking of cocaine, it led to nationally retired U.S. Navy Lt. Commander and former officer in the Office of Naval Intelligence, testified as a whistleblower about his involvement. Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Gary Webb also investigated these CIA covert operations and published a week of front-page articles in the San Jose Mercury News. Webb detailed them more extensively in his book Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion.4 While Webb’s 1996 San Jose Mercury News articles gained mass dissemination through the Internet, veteran journalists such as the Associated Press’s Robert Parry first broke the story in 1986. This contributed to the U.S. Congress holding hearings in the 1980s. Much of mainstream media ended up attacking Webb and the San Jose Mercury News, pressuring the publisher to stop the series with only half of the articles printed. Nonetheless, the aforementioned 1998 report by the CIA Inspector General stated the CIA did work with the Contras in trafficking cocaine, vindicating Webb and backing his findings.5 In 1986, the Nicaraguan military shot down a counter-revolutionary Contra supply plane laden with drugs, flying over Nicaragua. Southern Air Transport, a Florida-based cargo airline once controlled by the CIA, provided the plane. The event unraveled U.S. intelligence’s secret war on Nicaragua, with investigations prompting Congressional hearings. It was found that the Contras were being illegally funded by the U.S. through cocaine trafficking, as well as the sales of arms to Iran. When the public first found out about these operations in the late 1980s, the media dubbed it the Iran-Contra scandal. The seeds for Iran-Contra were planted seven years earlier, when Ayatollah Khomeini led the faction to overthrow the U.S-backed Shah of Iran. Khomeini’s government whipped up hatred towards the U.S. and took hostages whom they freed the day of President Ronald Reagan’s inauguration. Credible books claim weapons company owners who supported Reagan promised the Iranians arms sales if they held the hostages past election day, to help Reagan defeat President Carter. This secret agreement has been called the October Surprise.6 Congress said Reagan authorized such deals several years later. Reagan and Bush then used the money received from these arms sales for the illegal funding of a counter-revolutionary army against Nicaragua. In 1980, newly elected President Reagan and Vice President George H.W.

In 1980, newly elected President Reagan and Vice President George H.W. Bush began building support for the Nicaraguan Contras, after the socialist Sandanista government had seized power the year before. Early in the ’80s, Congress cut off U.S. government funding of the Contras due to their human-rights abuses, but Bush illegally reinstated it with the Iran-Contra cocaine operations. George Washington University archived the Reagan administration government documents on this part of the scandal, as well as the illegal, covert war against the Nicaraguan government.7 By 1986, the shot-down CIA plane that the Reagan/Bush operation used had secretly transported drugs and guns for years.8 In the early 1980s, Barry Seal, “one of the biggest cocaine and marijuana importers in the southern United States,” had piloted the plane. Louisiana’s attorney general said Seal smuggled “between $3 billion and $5 billion worth of drugs into the U.S.”9 Barry Seal had many connections to the CIA. Seal officially worked for the Agency in 1984, purportedly for a drug sting. Seal transported drugs through a small airport that was federally confirmed as a “joint training operation with another federal agency.” A National Security Council staffer said Seal’s “records showed him to be a contract CIA operative both before and during his years of drug running in Mena, Arkansas in the 1980s.”10 Writer Michael Montalvo documented how Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North’s own diary entries disclosed much of his role supervising the transportation of “over 500 tons of cocaine … to the poor masses of the inner cities and across the USA.” North purported the shipments were only trying to save Central America from Communism by funding the anti-Sandanista Contras.11 Reporter Webb and others described how the CIA operation accomplished this massive cocaine distribution by luring low-level drug dealers into high-level national trafficking. These CIA-backed suppliers trafficked the largest amounts of cocaine ever in this country, dropping kilogram prices from $60, 000 to $12, 000 in a year.12 Although the method of turning cocaine into more affordable and addictive “crack” first got the government’s attention in 1979, widespread marketing was not achieved until the early 1980s. Evidence indicates that U.S. intelligence used Los Angeles-based national crack cocaine traffickers, giving them virtual legal immunity for years. 13 Oliver North oversaw the Contra operation with his direct supervisor, Vice President George H.W. Bush. North worked as National Security Advisor to Bush while Bush headed the National Security Council.

Besides Professor Peter Dale Scott, Drug Enforcement Agency veteran Mike Levine wrote about his findings of CIA drug trafficking in his exposé Deep Cover. He repeated the allegations for years in his weekly Pacifica radio program, Expert Witness. 15 At least one other DEA agent, Celerino Castillo, testified to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about the CIA drugs- and arms-trafficking. A Senate committee chaired by Sen. John Kerry also interviewed key witnesses such as imprisoned drug dealers and money launderers, who disclosed their roles in the huge cocaine-trafficking scheme. Senior DEA supervisory agent Dennis Dayle said, “In my thirty-year history in DEA, the major targets of my investigations almost invariably turned out to be working for the CIA.” And finally, Leslie Cockburn exposed similar information in her book Out of Control, as did Nation columnist Alexander Cockburn, in White Out. 16 Los Angeles Police Department narcotics detective Michael C. Ruppert reported giving over two hundred and fifty pages of documents to members of the U.S. Senate Select Committee investigating CIA drug dealing. In his 1997 testimony to that committee, Ruppert said that his evidence showed conclusively that, as a matter of national policy, set at the National Security Council—the White House—elements of the CIA, in concert with elements of the military, and other federal agencies, have dealt drugs to Americans for at least three decades. Major defense contractors like E-Systems have also engaged in such traffic. Ruppert further said his evidence indicated “that the CIA has infiltrated and established illegal relationships with a number of police departments around the country. One of the purposes of this has been to protect CIA drug operations from law enforcement. I have personal knowledge of this activity in Los Angeles and New Orleans and have documented such a case in New York City.”17 Associated Press and Newsweek journalist Robert Parry documented how George H.W.

Bush was CIA Director in 1976, and how he continued to run intelligence operations for three decades through CIA staff that remained loyal to him. A congressional committee noted how when President Carter nominated Stansfield Turner as CIA Director to succeed Bush, Bush loyalist William Casey helped engineer a secret CIA office behind President Carter’s back from 1977-1981. Casey ran operations for the wealthiest conservative families without President Carter’s knowledge.19 Parry detailed how Casey then became President Reagan’s CIA Director, working under Vice President Bush. Casey proceeded to create a clique of CIA officers who maintained decades of dominance, including his key assistant, Robert Gates, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Parry also described many others as “Gates’s clones,” such as George Tenet (CIA Director 1997-2004, straddling the terms of presidents Clinton and George W. Bush), David Cohen and John McLaughlin, among others. These figures remained in top U.S. intelligence positions until at least 2009. Gates became George H.W. Bush’s CIA Director, George W. Bush’s Secretary of Defense and President Barak Obama’s Secretary of Defense for several years.20 U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Al Martin, the whistleblower involved in the Iran-Contra crack affair, showed letters from Congressmen thanking him for his testimony regarding the Iran-Contra crack hearings. He had testified about how Vice President Bush appointed CIA and FBI personnel to have direct contact with narcotics traffickers. Martin also testified that U.S. intelligence manipulated U.S. Customs to ensure certain aircraft and ships were not inspected. Martin further stated that U.S. intelligence maintained secured shipping routes and narcotics storage facilities.21 Closer to the street level of drug dealing, about the same time as Nicky Barnes and Legs Saunders dealt cocaine, the CIA was running a Californiabased cocaine-trafficking operation with a similar network. During that mid- ∵80s time period, U.S. intelligence-paid operatives supplied the nation’s west coast-based premier drug trafficker, “Freeway” Ricky Ross. Before his arrest in 1989 by an apparently honest federal agent, prosecutors said, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine. This earned the equivalent, in 2013 dollars, of a $2.5 billion gross profit and $850 million net profit.22 W hile the Iran-Contra scandal was an obvious reflection of Reagan/ hid politically-hot aspects of the scandal. One such aspect involved future president Bill Clinton, who either cooperated with the CIA on the drugtrafficking operation, or at least turned a blind eye while he was governor of Arkansas. Trafficker Barry Seal’s primary airport of entry was Mena, Arkansas. Reporter Gary Webb said, “Clinton’s critics have charged that it was impossible for the governor of Arkansas to have been unaware of Seal’s activities at Mena.”23 Terry Reed, an Air Force intelligence officer and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:272:855ba85a9e5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3557, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 273, "text": "politically-hot aspects of the scandal.

Reporter Gary Webb said, “Clinton’s critics have charged that it was impossible for the governor of Arkansas to have been unaware of Seal’s activities at Mena.”23 Terry Reed, an Air Force intelligence officer and FBI informant, wrote in his memoir Compromised that he aided the CIA Contra project under Clinton’s watch. This project facilitated gun- and drug-smuggling, with a weapons manufacturing company inside a fake “parking meter” factory in Arkansas. Other CIA-connected individuals set up similar front companies in the U.S. and in Nicaragua’s neighbor, El Salvador.24 This trafficking fueled a covert war on the Sandinistas, while massive inner-city crack cocaine distribution triggered a proliferation of gang wars in the U.S. It is interesting to note that a court convicted Clinton’s brother Roger and a high-powered supporter, Danny Ray Lasater, as co-conspirators with twenty-four other codefendants for drug trafficking out of Little Rock, Arkansas. Lasater was an investment bond broker in Little Rock, the largest bond community in the U.S. outside of New York City. This was probably due in part to laundered drug money, since bond brokers can play an intermediary role to keep the investors anonymous.25 The CIA Inspector General’s office confirmed that the CIA ran a joint training operation with another federal agency at Mena’s airport. Thus Clinton, reported as knowingly allowing Lasater’s trafficking, either colluded with the CIA’s operation or looked past it. An Arkansas State Police intelligence unit officer said that he was then ordered to shred nearly a thousand documents related to Mena and Iran-Contra.26 This foreshadowed how President Bill Clinton would tolerate intelligence operations during his presidency in the 1990s. Indeed, America increased its operations and military aid in Columbia in that decade. Accordingly, Columbia increased its coca leaf production fields from 3.8 to 12.3 thousand hectares from 1991 to 1999.27 As the 1980s came to a close, in many American cities cocaine and its cheaper and quicker delivery system, the rock-like smokeable “crack,” African-American and Latino neighborhoods, gangs increased in numbers, with the largest being Los Angeles’s rival Bloods and Crips. A Hollywood film, Colors, the title coming from their opposing red and blue bandana colors, made them well known worldwide.

Women had to deal, steal or prostitute themselves.29 The violence stemming from these gang wars for command of drugdealing turf harmed communities around the country. Many people were killed in these wars, including innocent adults and children who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. As fear rose, those who could flee from crime-ridden urban areas did so, bringing down the tax base and impoverishing inner city areas with abandoned buildings and limited revenue to pay for services. The “War on Drugs” was the creation of conservative political strategists.… That it resulted in disproportionate drug-arrest rates in poor communities of color may even have been part of the plan.… Alexander’s statistics [show that] in 2004, 75 percent of all people imprisoned for drug offenses were black or Latino, despite the fact that the majority of the country’s illegal-drug users and dealers are white.30 Supporting Michelle Alexander’s conclusions, a New York Times column noted that President Clinton signed a law (originally formulated under President G.H.W. Bush) establishing the 100-to-1 punishment ratio for crack cocaine possession versus powder, meaning sentencing guidelines of six months for possession of a small amount of powder cocaine were six hundred months (50 years) for possession of the same amount of crack cocaine. The Times column said, “Clinton signed this despite the pleas of civil rights leaders who correctly predicted that this would be an anvil dropping on the black community.” Alexander’s The New Jim Crow spent ten months on the New York Times bestseller list. In her introduction, Alexander wrote, Few legal rules meaningfully constrain the police in the drug war, and enormous financial incentives have been granted to law enforcement to engage in mass drug arrests through military-style tactics. Once swept into the system, one’s chances of ever being truly free are slim, often to the vanishing point … [The New Jim Crow] debunks the notion that rates of black imprisonment can be explained by crime rates and identifies the huge racial disparities at every stage of the criminal justice process—from the initial stop, search, and arrest to the plea bargaining and sentencing phases. In short, [The New Jim Crow] explains how the legal rules that structure the system guarantee discriminatory results. These legal rules ensure that the undercaste is overwhelmingly black and brown.31 A number of other sources supported Alexander’s conclusions.

The Pennsylvania courts found both judges guilty, and stated that one of the judges had violated the constitutional rights of thousands of kids. A number of these kids were sent to juvenile prisons after first-time minor offenses such as marijuana paraphernalia possession.32 Another example of systemic corruption that is incarcerating people en masse comes from documents released by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. Reuters detailed how the Drug Enforcement Agency had a Special Operations Division that partnered with over two dozen other agencies, including the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and Homeland Security. The DEA trained federal agents in falsifying their investigative trail, what they did in their investigation and how they came to find evidence, which they called a “parallel construction”—a false story about how and when they obtained evidence. This opens the door for planting false evidence without being caught. As Reuters detailed: A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans. Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin – not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges. The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to “recreate” the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant’s Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don’t know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence – information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses. “I have never heard of anything like this at all,” said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records.33 U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark remains one of many prominent people who backed Alexander’s general view even before these revelations about bribed judges and the DEA’s systemic cover-ups. After working under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, Clark became a more radical activist, and gave his opinion of U.S. intelligence’s use of drugs. As noted earlier, he said, “I think the government uses drugs to sedate and divide the masses.”34 this loss", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:275:0d7deb4f6078", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3560, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 276, "text": "the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records.33 U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark remains one of many prominent people who backed Alexander’s general view even before these revelations about bribed judges and the DEA’s systemic cover-ups.

As noted earlier, he said, “I think the government uses drugs to sedate and divide the masses.”34 this loss of easier access to inexpensive Golden Triangle opium crops, opium production declined. One of the top producers of the Golden Triangle, the country of Laos, produced 200 tons of opium in 1975 and only 30 tons by 1984. U.S. intelligence proceeded to increase activities in the “Golden Crescent” region where Pakistan borders Afghanistan, lying at the other end of the same mountain range containing American oligarchs started meddling around the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the early 1970s. The U.S. has been giving military and economic aid to neighboring Pakistan at least since then.37 Professor Peter Dale Scott holds that Pakistan had started to increase its “support for Afghan Islamic resistance movements following a left-wing coup [in Afghanistan] in 1973.” The Pakistan-Afghan three-fold increase in opium production coincided with this support for Afghanistan’s Islamic resistance to the more leftist Afghan coup leaders.38 The CIA cultivated key Pakistani assets who assisted in an arms pipeline to the Afghan Islamic resistance.39 One of these assets was the Gulf Group shipping line of the Gokal brothers. Another was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). While researchers suspected CIA ties to the bank’s future officers before its founding in 1972, in 1976 CIA Director George H.W. Bush strengthened the CIA’s ties to various Arab intelligence agency figures who were all BCCI insiders.40 When President Carter took office in 1976, he did not reappoint Bush as CIA Director. It was then that Bush and William Casey set up the secret CIA office and worked with British intelligence. They set up a Bank of Credit and Commerce International affiliate in the Cayman Islands. During the Iran-Contra crack hearings, it came out that BCCI was the top conduit for laundering money in these 1980s dealings.41 This, along with the fall of the longtime CIA-supported Shah of Iran, put the CIA into intensive planning mode, figuring how to gain more control in Pakistan and Afghanistan, neighboring Iran’s oil-rich Middle East region. President Carter’s National Security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski made important disclosures confirmed by U.S. intelligence reports. In an interview with a French media organization he said he advised Carter to start arming and funding radical fundamentalist Islamic fighters (the mujaheddin) to wage war on the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan in early 1979. President Carter armed and funded the mujaheddin’s war on Afghanistan’s leftist leadership, and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan about eight months later.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:276:d0d8234d74c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3561, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 277, "text": "neighboring Iran’s oil-rich Middle East region.

President Carter armed and funded the mujaheddin’s war on Afghanistan’s leftist leadership, and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan about eight months later. According to Afghan expert Dr. Barnett Rubin in testimony before Congress, the U.S. proceeded to pay and arm Afghan mercenaries to fight the Soviet Union. The same American oligarchs involved in opium trafficking in the Vietnam area were now trafficking opium out of Afghanistan.43 Afghanistan, the size of Texas, shared its northern border with the Soviet Union. For ten years the Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan to help fight the Islamic mujaheddin. All the while, the Reagan and Bush administrations continued a proxy war for that decade, arming and paying the mujaheddin to keep fighting. The CIA considered the Golden Crescent a new Golden Triangle. Heroin factories popped up on the Afghan-Pakistan border to help process the opium for local sales, while raw opium traveled globally. “By 1980 Pakistan-Afghan opium dominated the European market and supplied sixty percent of America’s illicit demand.”44 Professor McCoy wrote that 1979 to 1989 encompassed “ten years of CIA covert support for the mujaheddin resistance.” He detailed how this resistance involved Afghan guerillas and Pakistani military intelligence. The Washington Post noted that CIA Director William Casey advised Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to train mujaheddin resistance for attacks upon the Soviet Union, which they eventually carried out. McCoy added that during this time, the “U.S. government and media sources were silent about the involvement of leading Afghan guerillas and Pakistan military in the heroin traffic.”45 Veteran Daily Telegraph journalist Ahmed Rashid, whose best-selling books include Jihad: The Rise of Militant Islam in Central Asia, wrote, “In 1986 the secret services of the United States, Great Britain and Pakistan agreed to launch guerilla attacks in [Soviet territories] Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. [The task] was given to [Pakistan’s] favorite mujaheddin leader, Gulbuddin [Hekmatyar].” Reuters, the British version of the Associated Press, also confirmed that a guerilla warfare training camp in Afghanistan was “set up in the early 1980s by the CIA and ISI and run by … Hekmatyar.” Hekmatyar was supplementing his CIA and Pakistani ISI income with profits from his heroin labs in the Pakistani intelligence-controlled area at this time. Hekmatyar, who founded the Muslim Brotherhood, became Afghanistan’s leading drug lord.46 CIA-Pakistani intelligence strategy included heavy control over the drug flows. Professor Peter Dale Scott believed that CIA Director William Casey followed through on a plan promoted “to him by an Alexandre de Marenches, that the CIA supplied drugs on the sly to Soviet troops.” While Marenches", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:277:d8c5b122b8bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3562, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 278, "text": "Hekmatyar was supplementing his CIA and Pakistani ISI income with profits from his heroin labs in the Pakistani intelligence-controlled area at this time.

Professor Peter Dale Scott believed that CIA Director William Casey followed through on a plan promoted “to him by an Alexandre de Marenches, that the CIA supplied drugs on the sly to Soviet troops.” While Marenches denied it went through, reports came in that “Heroin, hashish, and even cocaine from Latin America soon reached Soviet troops.” These reports said the CIA-ISI-linked Bank of Credit & Commerce International, along with several American intelligence operatives, were deeply involved in the drug trade before the war was over. Scott wrote, “Maureen Orth heard from Mathea Falco, head of International Narcotics Control for the State Department under Jimmy Carter, that the CIA and ISI together encouraged the mujaheddin to addict the Soviet troops.”47 Professor McCoy cited that they had hundreds of heroin refineries, and they targeted the Pakistani people, increasing heroin addiction there from 5,000 users in 1980 to 1.3 million by 1986. By 1990, mainstream media substantiated Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Afghan heroin trafficking. A front-page article in the Washington Post stated that a senior administration official in the White House confirmed Hekmatyar and the Pakistan ISI as American allies involved in heroin trafficking.48 The increased CIA involvement in the Golden Crescent area along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan contributed to the ever-increasing opium production there. After a growth to 1,200 tons in 1978, it almost quadrupled in the next twenty years. The United Nations said Afghanistan’s opium production had risen to 4,600 tons in 1999, or seventy percent of the world’s total.49 York: Seven Stories, 1998), p. 144.

This article was adapted from Parry’s book, Secrecy and Privilege: Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq (2004). Parry said that before George Bush left the presidency in ’92, he appointed Robert Gates as CIA Director and David Cohen as deputy director of the Directorate of Intelligence. Many CIA administrators petitioned President Bill Clinton for a housecleaning of all the Bush/Reagan leftover intelligence leaders. While Clinton let go of Gates, he left Cohen and others in their powerful positions. He also appointed a neo-conservative Democrat who was close to Bush, James Woolsey, as CIA director. Clinton then appointed another Gates ally, George Tenet, as CIA director in his second presidential term. 21 Martin, The Conspirators, p. 162. 22 On CIA’s California-based trafficking, see Webb, Dark Alliance.

Cobain, like a number of other grunge musicians, developed a heroin problem in the early 1990s. As the Afghan heroin-producing opium supply grew in the 1990s, American and European consumption also grew. While a number of even more popular among a fringe collection of artists and musicians who lived in urban areas. From the 1960s to the 1990s, a number of these musicians who became influential in alternative music developed heroin problems. Some of them also crossed paths with members of U.S. intelligence. In the 1960s, John Lennon, who had glorified heroin use with his Beatles’ White Album song “Me and My Monkey,” referring to the slang “monkey on my back” for addiction, had spies watching him closely. Velvet Underground lead-singer songwriter Lou Reed, managed by suspected spy Miles Copeland III, wrote “Heroin” and “Waiting for My Man.” White House physician Max “Dr. Feelgood” Jacobson regularly gave psychedelics and amphetamines or cocaine-with-heroin “speedballs” to people who attended Andy Warhol’s parties, where the Velvet Underground first performed as the house band. Jacobson had also frequented Timothy Leary’s gatherings. World-renowned artist Warhol produced the Velvet Underground’s influential first albums.1 In the 1970s, one of the first American punk icons, Iggy Pop, had a known heroin addiction while his band, the Stooges, popularized aggressive, intelligent, “pre-punk” rock music. Anarchist punk-rock icon Sid Vicious, of early ’70s British punk-rock band, the Sex Pistols, reportedly died of uncertain causes after a slip-up with heroin following some clean time. His girlfriend Nancy Spungeon developed her heroin addiction when living in New York prior to their meeting. She traveled to England and moved in with Vicious. Spungeon died of a knife wound four months before Vicious. Vicious had at one point been implicated in her death, but British investigators never came to a conclusion about who killed her.2 By the 1980s, more punk-inspired musicians developed heroin problems. For example, Australian punk singer Nick Cave started using heroin and glorified the drug with compelling lyrics and music for his band, The Birthday Party. In Sydney, Australia, CIA and Special Forces veteran Michael Hand joined businessman Frank Nugan to form Nugan Hand Bank. Nugan had notes from CIA Director William Colby, and other top CIA help, in aiding heroin traffickers. Prof. Peter Dale Scott said that Nugan Hand Bank financed the first major drug imports, “organized by veterans of U.S. Special Forces and CIA in Laos.” Australian heroin addiction rose dramatically in the late 1970s.3 Urban whites were more likely to try heroin and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:285:f1bf97eafc98", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3570, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 286, "text": "In Sydney, Australia, CIA and Special Forces veteran Michael Hand joined businessman Frank Nugan to form Nugan Hand Bank.

Vail and Bikini Kill singer Kathleen Hanna helped influence Cobain’s increasingly radical leftist politics.6 Bikini Kill’s feminist politics followed the lineage of radical-leftist punk rockers, The Clash.7 Post-punk bands such as Washington DC’s “hardcore” band Fugazi continued in this vein, and was well known for its “straight edge” anti-drug lifestyle. This term came from the song “Straight Edge,” by Fugazi singer Ian McKaye’s former band, Minor Threat (without co-lead singer Guy Picciotto). As a teenager, Kurt Cobain recreationally used alcohol and marijuana, and soon used psychedelic drugs a few times. By the late 1980s, Cobain loved Fugazi, and even had their name written on his shoes. In 1989, Nirvana had produced its first album Bleach, for local Seattle independent record label Sub Pop.8 An MTV video, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” helped Nirvana break out globally in the late summer of 1991. Their album Nevermind hit the top of the pop charts in the U.S. and seven other countries by the beginning of 1992, selling five million copies in four months. Nevermind would go on to sell 10 million copies in the U.S. and 30 million worldwide by 2011.10 Journalists noted how Nevermind’s unmatched success changed the course of music, the recording industry and even fashion.11 The “grunge” look of jeans, t-shirts, or flannel shirts to keep warm, were popularized by the clothing Kurt Cobain and his fellow band members continued to wear even after they began making lots of money. Wal-Mart and K Mart supposedly for Cobain’s sculpture of fetuses on its cover, also contained four pictures of the burnt-out Los Angeles Republican Party Headquarters during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Cobain further forced Rolling Stone magazine to display his t-shirt in their cover picture of him. He had written on the shirt: “Corporate Magazines Still Suck.”12 Not everyone was aware of Kurt Cobain’s left-wing political passions.

He had written on the shirt: “Corporate Magazines Still Suck.”12 Not everyone was aware of Kurt Cobain’s left-wing political passions. Michael Azzerad published a biography of the band, Come as You Are, six months before Cobain’s death, revealing Cobain’s politics that ranged from pro-Democrat to radical anarchist. On the mainstream side, Cobain urged his fans to vote for Bill Clinton in 1992, and was credited with making the difference in Clinton’s win over George H.W. Bush. In that election, youth came out to vote in the largest percentages since the voting age was first lowered in the 1960s.13 Cobain’s political actions were often discreet, such as putting an anonymous track on an AIDS benefit album, and participating in benefits for abortion rights groups, anti-bigotry organizations, and anti-censorship organizations. He also battled prejudice by publicizing his hypothetical bisexuality and hatred of homophobia.14 More radically, Cobain was quoted as saying he originally wanted to put “revolutionary debris” inside his hugely popular album Nevermind. He said this meant “all kinds of anarchistic, revolutionary essays and diagrams about how to make your own bomb. And I just thought we better hold off on that … we’d be more effective if we gained popularity first. Then people might actually think twice about it.”15 While Cobain’s lyrics remained more personal and apolitical, he consistently made liberal-to-revolutionary political statements in other public forums. In the band’s first biography, Cobain said his popular single “Lithium” was an update on Communist Manifesto author Karl Marx’s statement on religion as the opiate of the masses.16 In interviews he took a leftist perspective, mocking the American economic system, saying if major record labels bought up all the alternative bands, then, “Chalk one up for capitalism. Let’s get our top hats and tails and have a cigar.”17 anadian award-winning writers Max Wallace and Ian Halperin spent Cyears investigating Cobain’s death, after musicians they knew said it was suspicious. Wallace wrote for the New York Times and contributed to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Halperin co-authored two bestselling books, was a regular correspondent on Court TV and contributed to 60 Minutes 2. Their first book, Who Killed Kurt Cobain, came out in 1998. They published Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain in 2004.

Grant started investigating her on his own, after he found evidence of foul play. released. Love, who had left another husband a year before, became pregnant with Cobain’s child within several months of their meeting. Some of Cobain’s close friends, such as Dylan Carlson, said Love’s pregnancy prompted Cobain to propose to her. They were married in February of 1992 with a prenuptial agreement, which barred either getting the other’s money via divorce. By that time some band members had become unhappy with Cobain’s budding heroin addiction and disapproved of Courtney Love. Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and all family members of Cobain and Love were absent from the wedding.1 Most reports had Cobain’s regular heroin use starting at the same time he started dating Courtney. Love’s father and ex-husband both said she had a regular heroin addiction while she lived with them. After the birth of Cobain and Love’s child, Vanity Fair published an article about Love, describing her heroin addiction.19 Kurt Cobain’s heroin addiction reportedly reached its peak when he almost failed to complete a Saturday Night Live performance. Cobain went to detox in September 1992.20 Kurt Cobain apparently relapsed with heroin after his detox. In an incident less than a year prior to his death, on May 2, 1993 Cobain had shot up heroin in what private detective Tom Grant reported as an accidental overdose. Grant obtained the police report, and reprinted a copy of it in his Case Study Manual. It says that after Cobain became semiconscious from the accidental overdose, Courtney claimed to have tried to revive him by injecting him with buprenorphine. She also force-fed him Valium and four codeine-based Tylenol pills, containing acetaminophen and Benadryl. Grant said that adding these drugs to Cobain’s system put him at much greater risk of death.21 While the full extent of Cobain’s heroin addiction remains uncertain, reports suggest that a stomach problem he had since he was a teenager was the trigger for his continued drug use. The stomach ailment left him vomiting, starving and in bed for weeks. The most commonly prescribed medication for stomach ailments, Paragoric, included a tincture of opium, as it relieved intestinal problems. Cobain ended up trying morphine and then used heroin. However, in the summer of 1993, a doctor diagnosed Cobain’s problem as a pinched nerve and successfully treated it, along with prescribing a medication that helped sustain his treatment. Virtually all reports supported Cobain’s abstinence from heroin while on this medication.22 By September 1993, Nirvana released their second album with Geffen Records, In Utero, which topped the pop sales charts its first week out.

Shortly before the album’s release, Kurt Cobain increased his share of the band’s formerly equally divided royalties, since he had written most of the songs. Friends said Love had nagged him repeatedly for almost two years to make these changes with his bandmates. Cobain reluctantly threatened to quit the band unless his bandmates accepted his getting 100% of money from the lyrics and 75% of royalties from the music, to be applied retroactively to Nevermind’s sales. This caused a rift between Cobain and his band.23 Now that they were rich, Courtney Love insisted she and Cobain live in an expensive house in the wealthiest neighborhood, the polar opposite of their apartment in the seedy university district of Seattle. Living across a lake from billionaire Bill Gates, Cobain complained to friends he was embarrassed by the house’s extravagance. Cobain’s friend Peter Cleary said the singer booked a 38-day European tour partly because he “was like an emotional cripple around his wife, but on tour … he was the boss.” Cobain was certain to gain some independence, since Courtney couldn’t accompany him while she was mixing her band Hole’s upcoming album.24 Kurt Cobain had gotten into increasing conflicts with his wife by this time. Their lawyer, Rosemary Carroll, said they had become hateful towards each other. Cobain had finally decided to leave Love, wanting a divorce. Love called and asked Carroll to find her, “the meanest, most vicious divorce lawyer” she knew.26 Nonetheless, Cobain adored his one-and-a-half year-old daughter Frances, and missed her on his music tours. So he asked Love to bring Frances and meet him in Rome. Love had flown to London for publicity regarding her upcoming album. Love and Frances met with Cobain in a hotel in Rome on March 3, 1994.27 Around 6:15 a.m. the next day, Love called the front desk and asked them to get an ambulance, as she had found Cobain unconscious on the floor. Twenty-four hours later, Cobain woke up from what the doctor described as a pharmacological coma “due not to narcotics, but the combined effect of alcohol and tranquilizers which had been medically prescribed by a doctor [to Love].” Everyone called it an accidental overdose. No one but Love ever referred to it as a suicide attempt.28 Back home in Seattle two weeks later on March 18, Courtney Love called 911 and said her husband had locked himself in a room with a gun and was threatening to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:289:5c1486956f99", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3574, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 290, "text": "from what the doctor described as a pharmacological coma “due not to narcotics, but the combined effect of alcohol and tranquilizers which had been medically prescribed by a doctor [to Love].” Everyone called it an accidental overdose.

When police arrived at their Lake Washington estate, they found Cobain behind a locked door, but their report said he told them he was in there “to keep away from Courtney.” The report further said he insisted that he didn’t want to hurt himself and that he didn’t have a gun in the room with him. When the police questioned Love about her false report, she apparently admitted not seeing him take a gun, and said she didn’t hear him say he was going to kill himself. The officers confiscated Cobain’s four guns from the house, a box of ammunition and, importantly, Cobain’s stomach medication pills. Cobain bought another rifle at the end of March.29 In late March, Cobain and Love reportedly battled over his wanting to back out of the scheduled headlining of the Lollapalooza tour, which would have made him millions of dollars, along with millions for others. Soon after this conflict, Cobain called his fellow bandmembers to announce he was breaking the band up. Subsequently, Love and several of Cobain’s management executives did an intervention on Cobain, during which Love threatened to limit Cobain’s access to his daughter unless he went into rehab. Much evidence suggests that Cobain had largely gotten away from narcotics at this time. But whether or not he had a “slip” with his heroin use, he felt threatened enough to enter Exodus residential treatment in Los Angeles on March 30.30 Private detective Tom Grant said that on Friday, April 1, Courtney Love later that day. Exodus and most other long-term residential drug treatments centers are not locked-down facilities. Cobain entered under his own volition, so he could have told staff he wanted to leave and walked out the door without a problem, ignoring their suggestions for him to stay. Instead, he avoided talking to staff about deciding to leave early, and climbed over a six-foot wall in the back, according to journalists Wallace and Halperin.31 Soon after leaving rehab that Friday night at 8:47 p.m., Cobain called the Peninsula Hotel in L.A., where Courtney Love was staying, and left a message for her. The message said he was staying with a friend, leaving Love the number of the friend, a woman named Elizabeth in California. Cobain then took a plane flight to Seattle early the next morning.

The message said he was staying with a friend, leaving Love the number of the friend, a woman named Elizabeth in California. Cobain then took a plane flight to Seattle early the next morning. From her Peninsula Hotel room, Love called private detective Tom Grant on April 3, purportedly to hire him to look for her husband, alleging she didn’t know where he was. According to Grant, he brought another investigator with him and they met with Love in her hotel room, where she told them about having a phony story planted with the Associated Press, saying she had overdosed on drugs and was in the hospital. Grant claimed Love said she did this to get Cobain’s attention.32 On that day, Love also evidently told Grant she had Cobain’s credit card canceled and wanted Grant to call the credit card company to find out about attempted activities on the card. The following day, Grant said Love told him that she had called in a missing person’s report pretending to be Kurt’s mother, Wendy O’Connor. On April 6, Love sent Grant to Seattle to look for Cobain, but Grant had no luck finding him.33 However, evidence points to high-level police and media cover-up of a murder scenario in which Cobain’s wife Courtney took part. Did U.S. intelligence first allow Cobain’s popularity and known drug usage to foster an era of “heroin chic”? Then, when the politically radical leftist Cobain showed signs of getting away from heroin and influencing his fans contrary to the interests of America’s drug-trafficking oligarchy, did they orchestrate his murder? Evidence supports this scenario. Cobain’s death made front-page news worldwide. Virtually all the stories repeated a Seattle police spokesman’s account that Cobain had been shooting heroin intravenously in the sunroom, then used a shotgun to commit suicide. Media looked for suicidal statements, magazines lauded his musical influence, but most mainstream investigative reporters did little-to-no investigation of a possible homicide. During the next ten years, independent investigations about Cobain’s “sui-cide” found links to U.S. intelligence foul play, but there was extremely sparse mainstream media coverage until the new millennium. Award-winning investigative journalist Duff Wilson published a story in the Seattle Times a month after Cobain’s death. Wilson’s sources in the Seattle Police Department told him that many facts in Cobain’s case didn’t add up. For example, private detective Tom Grant found and shared with police that someone tried to use Cobain’s credit card between the time of his death and his body being found. Additionally, the suicide note didn’t appear to be about suicide at all, and the handwriting changed part way through it.

Additionally, the suicide note didn’t appear to be about suicide at all, and the handwriting changed part way through it. With the knowledge from his former police detective work, Grant said the police also made the highly doubtful claim that there weren’t any legible fingerprints on the shotgun.34 After publishing these inconsistencies, neither Wilson nor the Seattle Times followed up with a long-term investigation. More importantly, a police officer investigator working at the scene said his supervisor told the team of police investigators that they were not to investigate Cobain’s death as a homicide, making it clear from the start that the so-called homicide investigation was just a show. The officer said this highly surprised him and other police investigators, especially with the change in handwriting on the suicide note at a particularly important point. That part of the note was only a goodbye to fans; the band acknowledged that Cobain was breaking them up.35 After refusing countless lucrative financial offers for over fifteen years, Tom Grant eventually came out with his own independently published books on this subject. He had formerly only shared much of his work with authors Max Wallace and Ian Halperin, for their books. Wallace and Halperin also produced a film, The Cobain Case, based on these books. It was released in Europe, while American media refused to even make mention of it, except on YouTube. It includes recorded conversations between Tom Grant and Courtney Love, along with their lawyer, Rosemary Carroll. This film further shows Cobain’s grandfather Leland Cobain, the relative to whom Cobain was closest. Leland Cobain and his wife Iris didn’t believe Kurt was suicidal. Leland also believes his grandson was murdered.37 Some of the accumulated evidence supporting this murder scenario includes the amount of opiates in Cobain’s corpse, accompanied by Valium, which potentiates heroin. Cobain had a morphine level seventy times higher than the amount that would kill the average person, and three times the amount of heroin that would immediately incapacitate and kill even a severe addict.38 This suggests that someone gave Cobain a “hot shot”—a dose many times the normal 5% purity of street-bought heroin.39 In 1997, the NBC-TV show Unsolved Mysteries released Cobain’s autopsy report findings to Cyril Wecht, President of the American Academy of Forensic Science. He said, “For most people, including addicts, [this] is a significant level. And for most of them, the great percentage, it will be a level that will induce a state of unconsciousness quite quickly. We’re talking about seconds, not minutes.” He continued, “I just can’t tell you that it would have been impossible” that Cobain", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:292:a5d4a9115c62", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3577, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 293, "text": "street-bought heroin.39 In 1997, the NBC-TV show Unsolved Mysteries released Cobain’s autopsy report findings to Cyril Wecht, President of the American Academy of Forensic Science.

We’re talking about seconds, not minutes.” He continued, “I just can’t tell you that it would have been impossible” that Cobain then pulled the trigger of the shotgun, “but it does raise a question as to whether or not he shot that shotgun.”41 Wecht went on to say, off camera, “If it was suicide, he probably would have had to be holding the gun in his hand while he was injecting himself with the heroin, and then shot himself immediately after the injection.” As seen in the trailer for an important movie on Cobain’s murder, Dr. Wecht said, “I can not think of a case in which someone injects himself with a large amount of heroin and then proceeds to kill himself. It just doesn’t make sense.”42 an Halperin, Max Wallace and Tom Grant found particularly strong I evidence that Courtney Love helped set up her husband’s murder, partly to get his money, since the prenuptial agreement would have nullified any alimony she could have gotten with a divorce.44 Attorney Rosemary Carroll, whom the couple had also named godmother to their daughter, first raised the possibility of Love setting up Cobain’s murder. Cobain had felt so close to Carroll, he told friends he regarded her as a surrogate mother. Carroll said Cobain wasn’t suicidal, and that Cobain was divorcing Love. Carroll discussed her suspicions with Grant, who taped most of his phone conversations about the case. They are summarized in Love and Death, can be heard on Grant’s website, and were played for reporters in April 2004.45 Grant said Love originally told him that Cobain had prematurely left a residential drug treatment facility and that she was looking for him. Within twenty-four hours she apparently changed her story, saying first she thought Cobain was suicidal, and then that Cobain was divorcing her and leaving her for another woman.46 On April 6th, two days prior to the discovery of Cobain’s body, Love visited Carroll and accidentally left behind her backpack. After Cobain’s corpse was found, Carroll looked through Love’s backpack and found two pieces of paper. One was a “to do” note that read, “Get Arrested.” (On April 7, Love was arrested after a reported overdose. It gave her an alibi for where she was when her husband was found dead.) The second piece of paper looked like handwriting practice, as if to forge a letter. Carroll took the backpack to private detective Grant, who secretly copied the suicide note that Love refused to show anyone after the police investigation.

Carroll took the backpack to private detective Grant, who secretly copied the suicide note that Love refused to show anyone after the police investigation. After Grant showed Carroll the note, Carroll said she didn’t believe Cobain killed himself, and added that Love “planned the whole thing.”48 Many believe Love lied in saying Cobain was suicidal. Besides Carroll’s statement, Cobain’s closest friend, Dylan Carlson, told Grant that Cobain was confronting some issues, but was optimistic about them, not suicidal. Two psychologists who evaluated Kurt Cobain in the rehabilitation center didn’t find him suicidal either. Friends who visited Cobain in rehab saw him happily playing with his infant daughter.50 Cobain’s grandfather, Leland, said Kurt wasn’t suicidal, and had asked Leland to help him choose a new pick-up truck to buy. Even Courtney admitted once, “I don’t think he was really suicidal when he came home [from drug rehab].”51 Though Courtney Love said Kurt Cobain’s brief coma due to accidentally overdosing on her sleep medication in Rome was a suicide attempt, details suggest it was another attempt by Love to kill him. When the hospital pumped Cobain’s stomach they found evidence of Rohypnol, the infamous “Roofie” drug used to dope and rape women, as the drug leads them not to remember anything that happened. In Rome these are most commonly known as sedatives or sleeping pills.52 Love’s very questionable behavior around Cobain’s death a month later, and the impending divorce, suggests Love may have slipped a massive amount of Rohypnol in Cobain’s drink that night in Rome. Love and several others had pressured Cobain to go into drug rehab. After Cobain left rehab early and got back to Seattle, he talked to Michael “Cali” Dewitt, another live-in nanny for the couple’s infant daughter. Hotel phone records show Love talked to Dewitt continuously that week, even though she had her daughter with her in an L.A. hotel.53 Dewitt was a former boyfriend of Love’s and a known heroin user. Grant and Carroll stated suspicions about Dewitt’s role in Cobain’s murder. Grant found a note Dewitt wrote to Cobain at Cobain’s home, in the time between the singer’s presumed death (April 5) and finding his body in a room above the home’s garage (April 8). Grant found the note the night of April 7, and believed it sounded like an attempt to cover up Dewitt’s knowledge of Cobain’s death. He’d later learn police had taxi records showing Dewitt left from the Cobain home for a plane flight to L.A. several hours earlier, before Grant arrived.54 Phone records and Love’s payments to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:294:c8da1b432f18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3579, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 295, "text": "home, in the time between the singer’s presumed death (April 5) and finding his body in a room above the home’s garage (April 8).

He’d later learn police had taxi records showing Dewitt left from the Cobain home for a plane flight to L.A. several hours earlier, before Grant arrived.54 Phone records and Love’s payments to Dewitt and his family point to Dewitt as a suspect in Cobain’s death. Phone records place Dewitt in Cobain’s home until April 5, when he left to stay at a friend’s place. Dewitt returned briefly on April 7. Love got Dewitt a high-paying job at Geffen Records. Love also paid several hundred thousand dollars to Dewitt’s father to renovate her house, and she paid for many of Dewitt’s drug detoxes, along with detox for his girlfriend.55 Additionally, a Los Angeles-based musician and acquaintance of Love’s, Eldon Hoke, made the claim on television and film that Courtney Love had come to his workplace at a record store and offered him $50, 000 to kill Cobain. He said she provided him with a plan to make the killing look like a suicide. Hoke’s statement was backed by his boss, who overheard part of the conversation, and Hoke passed a lie detector test about this statement with a nationally renowned polygrapher. Many knew Hoke as having a drinking problem, and as someone who would do anything for money. Hoke, however, never followed through on Courtney’s offer.56 There is considerable evidence to suggest that Kurt Cobain’s wife, Courtney Love, planned her husband’s murder. However, investigations fell short in failing to explore why police superiors and mainstream media helped cover up the murder. They also failed to explore evidence of possible U.S. intelligence aid. The only explanation given by Tom Grant for police failures are “professional pride, city politics and potential lawsuits.” He claims there were copycat suicides within days of Cobain’s death that led police to not reinvestigate whether Cobain was murdered.57 Evidence suggests that, unknown to Cobain, U.S. intelligence used him to promote heroin use, similar to the way U.S. intelligence and media assets helped promote acid in the 1960s. Suppressed evidence indicates that U.S. intelligence helped orchestrate Cobain’s murder due to his antimaterialistic, radical leftist politics, along with his implicit threat to promote sobriety when he stopped using drugs. Police foul play started as early as what appeared to be Love’s first attempt to kill Cobain. While it’s not certain if Love gave Cobain the overly pure batch of heroin he nearly overdosed on in Seattle in May 1993, she was with him and immediately injected him and force-fed him more drugs that could have caused his death.

Private Detective Tom Grant asked why Love wasn’t “arrested for possessing, injecting and administering illegal drugs.” While Grant suggested that it was due to her friendship with certain Seattle Police Department officers, the police department blacked out an entire paragraph of the police report that described Love’s actions.58 By most accounts, Kurt Cobain finally found abstinence from heroin by the summer of 1993. Ironically, Cobain’s near-death experience on March 4 of 1994 actually offered evidence of this. The doctor in Rome found no narcotics in Cobain’s system besides the prescription tranquilizer Rohypnol. Cobain’s tourmates through Europe said he was not using any drugs, and wouldn’t even participate in “the very mild debauchery that went on.”59 Courtney Love said that Kurt Cobain barely drank in his last months alive.60 Police also failed to charge Love with any crime in what appeared to be a false report. That was the incident where Love claimed Cobain had locked himself in a room and said he was going to kill himself. Police confiscation of Cobain’s prescribed stomach medication could have caused him a setback. Two weeks later she allegedly filed another false police report mentioning that Cobain was suicidal, pretending she was Cobain’s mother. Police again failed to charge her, nor investigate why she did this, despite Tom Grant sharing his information with them.61 Seattle police have a substantial record of working closely with U.S. intelligence, including acting as provocateurs to infiltrate radical left political groups and promoting illegal drug use among them.62 Such a history helps make more sense of foul play around Kurt Cobain’s death. A source in the Seattle Police Department told researchers he and others in the department had serious doubts about the investigation, especially when the medical examiner declared Cobain’s death a suicide immediately upon viewing the corpse. The officer said, “The clincher for many of us was the note. Anybody who saw it thought it was strange.”63 Several years later, the Unsolved Mysteries television show hired two national handwriting experts to examine the note. They both confirmed the top part of the note was in Cobain’s handwriting, but the bottom was not.64 When authors Wallace and Halperin filed a Freedom of Information Act request for police department internal documents regarding the Cobain investigation, the Seattle Police refused to confirm or deny whether the photos remained in their files.66 Photo results could have been critical to the case.

One of America’s most respected forensic pathologists noted, “If somebody actually held Kurt [Cobain]’s hand around the gun and pulled the trigger, some of the blood would probably have splattered on their hand, leaving a void on Kurt’s.”67 Police delayed even a fingerprint analysis on the gun, only to declare nearly a month later there were no legible prints.68 Similarly, they did not check prints on shell casings or the note until three years later, when a television show about Cobain’s death was about to air.69 And, no follow-up was ever reported on who tried to use Cobain’s credit card after his death. As previously detailed, toxicology reports showed Cobain would most likely have died within seconds from the “hot shot” opiate overdose. Wallace and Halperin cited top medical journals and quoted national forensic pathologists in support of Cobain’s having three times the level of opiates in his blood stream than what would immediately kill even a severe addict. A CIA Assassination Manual discussed the use of heroin for assassination by causing an overdose.70 Detective Grant believed addict Mike Dewitt, one of the nannies for Frances Cobain who was dependent on and close to Love, was involved in Cobain’s murder. Colorado deputy coroner Denise Marshall believes that someone drugged Cobain, first with Valium (present in the autopsy report), possibly using the soda can found near him but never tested by police. Either Cobain then relapsed, or the killer injected the lethal dose of heroin in Cobain, before shooting him to create the appearance of a suicide.71 The purity of the heroin was one of the first pieces of evidence that U.S. intelligence might have played a part in the actual murder. Whoever gave him the drug would have had to have access to rare, pure heroin, which the government and some police departments have, but which is virtually impossible to find on the street. The extreme degree of police cover-up behavior further supported U.S. intelligence involvement.72 Police avoidance of following up on a top witness’s account put more of a spotlight on possible police intelligence involvement in Cobain’s murder. Eldon Hoke had appeared on the TV show Hard Copy, saying Courtney Love asked him to kill Kurt Cobain. Hard Copy paid for America’s leading polygraph examiner, Dr. Edward Gelb, to administer a polygraph to Hoke about this statement. Hoke’s score fell “beyond possibility of deception,” twice. Just after that appearance, Hoke and his friends called both Los Angeles and Seattle police departments in an attempt", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:297:b270cf730e8f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3582, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 298, "text": "account put more of a spotlight on possible police intelligence involvement in Cobain’s murder.

Just after that appearance, Hoke and his friends called both Los Angeles and Seattle police departments in an attempt to get the case reopened.73 This led Seattle police to briefly reopen the Cobain case, saying they would investigate Hoke’s report, but no documents show any follow-up.74 One police officer, Detective Antonio Terry, refused to abide by his boss’s orders to not conduct a homicide investigation. A month after Cobain’s death, Newsweek and the Seattle Times reported that Det. Terry spent nearly two hundred hours investigating the source of heroin found in Cobain’s corpse.75 A month later, Terry was driving home from work in civilian clothes in an unmarked car when a stranded motorist flagged him down at his known regular exit off the highway. When Terry pulled over and got out of his car to help, two gunmen shot him.76 When the case went to trial eighteen months later, it suggested highlevel cover-ups of the incident. Although mortally wounded, Terry shot one of his assailants. He then got back into his car, drove to his South Precinct, and made a statement in which he reported one of the shooters saying, “He’s a cop.” Terry bled to death after making the statement. He was the first police officer killed in the state of Washington in seven years. Someone in the police department then forged Terry’s personnel records that day. These details support the gunmen’s knowing who he was despite the absence of police trappings, that they tracked his home route, and then squashed any investigation of his murder. And that Det. Terry was murdered for bucking a much higher authority’s orders.77 Cobain was internationally known, a lifestyle image-maker whose music, dress, and even heroin usage influenced millions. So it is almost unbelievable that after his death so few major media organizations ever reported Grant’s or Halperin and Wallace’s findings. Only after a decade did some broadcast media briefly permit these researchers to present what they found, but none allowed any in-depth investigations. The years-long media cover-up of the evidence indicates CIA involvement, because of the Agency’s ability to censor such politically sensitive issues. As stated previously, U.S. intelligence aided in manufacturing and trafficking massive amounts of heroin from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.80 Cobain’s heroin use, amongst others’, helped popularize the drug for many Americans.

The fashion industry popularized “heroin chic.”81 Overall, the rate of long-term heroin users increased almost ten percent annually from 1990 to 1995.82 A heroinusing Kurt Cobain helped popularize this trend. A sober Cobain might have turned the trend around, while also turning many on to radical-left politics. Within five years of Cobain’s death, activists embodied the anarchism that Kurt Cobain said he wanted to support with the original idea of essays inside of Nirvana’s album Nevermind, and the pictures of burnt-out Los Angeles Republican Headquarters after the riots inside their album cover of In Utero. Radical activists gathered from around the country in Seattle to protest the World Trade Organization (WTO) summit. The activists claimed the WTO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were representing the wealthiest corporations in exploiting people globally. Left-wing groups for which Nirvana held benefits, such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR), gave much advance promotion to the anti-WTO protests, which ended up including marches, rallies, and ensuing riots. These Seattle protests sparked similar anti-WTO and anti-IMF protests for at least a couple of years, though they were more common abroad than in the U.S.83 Kurt Cobain’s cofounder of Nirvana, Krist Novoselic, for the occasion formed a band he called No WTO, with Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, and Jello Biafra, the former frontman of the Dead Kennedys. They only released one album, Live from the Battle in Seattle, on Biafra’s independent Alternative Tentacles label.84 However, without Kurt Cobain, this musical support for the anti-WTO protest went virtually unnoticed. 1 On Jacobson, see Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain, Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD, the CIA, the Sixties and Beyond (New York: Grove/Weidenfeld, 1985, 1992), p. 102. 2 Karen Schoemer, “The Day Punk Died,” New York, Oct. 19, 2008, http://nymag.com/ arts/popmusic/features/51394/. 3 Alfred McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade (New York: Lawrence Hill Books, 1972/1991), pp. 461-78.

Eldon Hoke’s claim about Courtney Love trying to inveigle him into In April of 1997, Sundance award-winning documentarian Nick Broomfield interviewed Hoke for his film Kurt and Courtney. Hoke repeated his claim about Love’s offer. In that interview, Hoke started to pronounce the name of someone he believed did accept Love’s offer, saying “Allen …” before stopping short and laughing nervously. A different interviewer, Brent Alden, said that on April 18 he talked with Hoke, and he was very frightened because he knew who killed Cobain: a local Los Angeles musician, Allen Wrench.1 Eldon Hoke died within a week of making this statement; Allen Wrench was the last person seen with Hoke before he died. But private detective Tom Grant said he believes the whole Wrench story is a “hoax.” While Grant is one of the best investigators of the Cobain case, he doesn’t state why he’s so sure Wrench being a suspect is a hoax. Writers Halperin and Wallace took Wrench somewhat seriously. They interviewed Wrench for their book Love and Death, and their film The Cobain Case. In those interviews, Wrench admitted to killing Cobain.2 Other evidence raises the question of whether U.S. intelligence inserted Allen Wrench into the Los Angeles punk music scene. A number of leftist political punk bands had sprung up in the Los Angeles area, including Black Flag, the Minutemen, and Rage Against the Machine, providing the impetus for U.S. intelligence to open operations there in an attempt to counter leftist political musicians. Allen Wrench clearly had designs to try and depoliticize punk rock. Although Wrench didn’t have any visible source of income, he came into wealth soon after Cobain’s death. With a house full of expensive recording equipment, he started his own barely profitable label, Devil Vision Records. He also bought a brand new Lexus soon after Cobain’s death. Wrench had a few minor arrests in his background, and was a master of Brazilian jiu jitsu.4 Wrench also had a surprisingly elaborate website for his local band, Kill Allen Wrench. The band, it declared, is all about “all four rock essentials: Satanic Worship, Alcoholism, Spousal Abuse, and Self Destructive Drug Use!” The website included transcribed interviews from female groupies. It also had an exhaustive gallery of frequently updated pornography. Concert photos of Wrench had him decked out in devil’s horns, pentagrams, red glop, and half-naked young groupies. Furthermore, despite suspicions of Wrench murdering Mentors lead singer Eldon Hoke, the two groups toured together with their similar apolitical, female defouling, pseudo-punk, supposedly humorous bands in 2012.

Wrench’s Facebook pictures include many with Mentors founding bassist Steve Broy playing in Wrench’s band.5 As previously detailed, Los Angeles had a history of vast U.S. intelligence operations overlapping the entertainment industry, particularly in Laurel Canyon, where the U.S. Air Force’s Lookout Mountain Laboratory film studio started in the 1940s, and military folks-turned musicians flocked in the 1960s. Allen Wrench reported regularly playing with Eldon “El Duce” Hoke’s band, the Mentors, on the Riverside, California ranch property of Mentors bassist Steve Broy. By 2003, Broy played both in Wrench’s band and the Mentors. Riverside lies near Los Angeles, within 70 miles of Laurel Canyon. The Mentors’ first album was Live at the Whiskey, referring to the Whiskey A-Go-Go, which launched the Laurel Canyon bands in the 1960s. Also, Broy’s Riverside property lies in the general vicinity of various Teledyne Technologies military contracting facilities. Riverside lies adjacent to both the Naval Surface Warfare Center and the March Air Reserve Base.6 Bassist Steve Broy’s biography stated that he started the Mentors with Hoke in Seattle in 1976. They later moved to Los Angeles, though Broy had taken time off from the band to get a degree in engineering. Steve Broy has worked as a “Director of Engineering at Teledyne Analytical Instruments,” with a Bachelors degree from the “University of Washington in Electrical Engineering.” Prior to Teledyne, Broy worked on military equipment for “TRW in Redondo Beach,” in the Los Angeles area, where In his aforementioned book Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon, Dave McGowan detailed another key aspect of the Laurel Canyon rock scene. In a chapter titled, “Dig! The Laurel Canyon Death List,” McGowan reported that at least twenty-seven longtime, or one-time residents of Laurel Canyon, mostly musicians, ended up dead for mysterious reasons. McGowan noted that Laurel Canyon musician “Mama” Cass Elliott reportedly died of “heart failure” at the age of thirty-two. Others died of overdoses, murders, traffic accidents, “natural causes,” and purported suicides.8 Alex Constantine, author of The Covert War Against Rock, believed U.S. intelligence killed Elliott for knowing too much and getting too politically progressive, unlike her previous Mamas and Papas bandmate, former military officer “Papa” John Phillips. Cass apparently had dinner with Bobby Kennedy, Roman Polanski and his actress partner, Sharon Tate, at film director John Frankenheimer’s home in 1968. Strangely enough, the followers of musician and sociopath Charles Manson murdered Tate along with coffee heiress Abigail Folger, who had met Manson years earlier in Cass’s home and later gave money to Manson and the Process Church cult, of which he was a member.

Mama Cass was the only member of The Mamas and The Papas to launch a successful solo career following the group’s break up. Cass had been dating Pic Dawson at the time of her death. Scotland Yard had been investigating him for international drug smuggling. Dawson’s father worked for the U.S. State department under Henry Kissinger. A Mama Cass biographer filed a FOIA request for FBI Constantine noted that one report on Mama Cass was marked “urgent” and “confidential,” stating that she attended a fundraiser in Hollywood that included Jack Nicholson, Ryan O’Neal, Marlo Thomas, Tuesday Weld, Burt Lancaster and Jane Fonda. The Entertainment Industry for Peace and Justice Committee (EIPJ) organized the event. Cass told television host Mike Douglas about her political ambitions as she organized against the Vietnam War from within the Democratic Party. Leftist writer Paul Krassner said that “Cass was a friend,” and believed “she may have been killed.” Pathologists in London, where Cass died, refused to specify the cause of death at a public hearing.9 David McGowan reviewed some particularly important characters of Laurel Canyon who carried out many murders. Charles Manson befriended Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Manson murderer Charles “Tex” Watson also hung out with Manson at many Laurel Canyon musicians’ parties. Watson further handled large drug transactions for Manson. Another Manson murderer, musician Bobby Beausoleil, had the job of driving girls to topless dance clubs and to shoots for porno films. Many of these girls also became part of Manson’s acid-drenched “family,” similar to Vito Paulekas’s acid-fueled dance troupe of proto-hippies who frequented the rock clubs and provided Laurel Canyon parties with orgies. Several of these Manson girls were accomplished musicians and, apparently, murderers.10 ourtney Love has lived a bizarre life filled with suspicious overlaps Cwith the goals of the CIA’s Operation MK-Ultra. Despite some singing talent, much of Love’s life makes her appear a fantasy-driven drug addict seeking glory by marrying a rock star or becoming one. However, closer scrutiny suggests she may have been groomed or conditioned from an early age to carry out some U.S. intelligence tasks. Courtney Love’s father Hank Harrison described his daughter’s apparent dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple personality disorder) in a book, Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain. Love had invited Harrison to attend a Hole show in 1993, where Harrison talked with Hole bass player Kristen Pfaff.

Love had invited Harrison to attend a Hole show in 1993, where Harrison talked with Hole bass player Kristen Pfaff. The bass player told Harrison she feared that Love was going in and out of various personalities as if she appeared “dissociative,” and was going through “fugue state amnesia.” Harrison said that over the years he also saw Courtney progress through various dissociative states. How she may have gotten this way deserves much consideration. Linda Carroll (no relation to Rosemary Carroll) was an adopted daughter of a family who had major stock holdings in the Bausch and Lomb eye-care business and in gold mining. Carroll gave birth to Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964, in San Francisco, California. Hank Harrison was attending graduate school and working as a counselor, while also managing the Warlocks for six months after they formed in the San Francisco Bay community of Palo Alto in May of 1965. The band soon changed its name to the Grateful Dead. Harrison lived with members of the Grateful Dead, and its bassist, Phil Lesh, became Courtney’s godfather. Interestingly, Carroll named her friend, Del Nan Winblad-DeMarco, Courtney’s godmother. Winblad-DeMarco’s right-wing husband had a huge ranch in Delano and was one of migrant farm workers organizer Cesar Chavez’s biggest foes. Courtney was born about sixteen months before the first Acid Tests at which the Grateful Dead performed.11 Courtney’s parents’ history appears to link with MK-Ultra’s. In the early 1970s, the Grateful Dead turned against Hank Harrison, as he published a book asserting that the band sold heroin. Linda Carroll was also intimately connected to drug users in Ken Kesey’s acid test scene, where high-level CIA MK-Ultra scientists such as John Gittinger attended several Acid Test parties.12 Courtney’s statement that several witnesses claim she was given LSD at the age of three remains hard to verify. Love said the acid came from her father, but Harrison presented a polygraph test that he passed stating he never gave Courtney acid. Carroll did send her daughter to psychotherapy at the age of three, a strange and uncontested biographical note. Carroll was raising Courtney in San Francisco at that time, Hank Harrison said that Linda Carroll’s parents pushed their adopted daughter to separate from him by 1967, when Courtney was three. Linda Carroll said in a memoir that her alcoholic adopted father, Jack Risi, regularly sexually molested her when she was very young. It’s unknown what was happening to Courtney, either in childcare, where Carroll said Courtney may have gone through “child abuse,” or her “therapy” at that age.

It’s unknown what was happening to Courtney, either in childcare, where Carroll said Courtney may have gone through “child abuse,” or her “therapy” at that age. But Harrison noted being puzzled as to why Courtney threw tantrums each time he had to take her back to Carroll’s home at the end of his weekend custody. Carroll divorced Harrison by 1968 and took him to court for full custody in 1970. Harrison said her parents used their wealth to extend the hearings for a year and to secretly bribe his lawyer, leading him to lose all rights. He said he went into a deep depression in the following years, as Carroll kept him from seeing Courtney.14 In federal hearings on CIA projects in 1995, two women, Chris De Nicola and Claudia Mullen, testified that they were victims of MK-Ultra experiments in subproject “Monarch,” starting at three years old, during the same 1967 time period Courtney Love attended psychotherapy. De Nicola’s and Mullen’s therapist, Valerie Wolfe, also testified, stating that forty other therapists contacted her, with remarkably similar stories from their patients, when they learned she was giving testimony. De Nicola and Mullen testified that LSD, trauma, and hypnosis were used on them from infancy until the age of sixteen, to help turn them into prostitutes and assassins for the CIA. Mullen said that MK-Ultra’s John Gittinger and Sidney Gottlieb did the experimental training on her. Other female agents wrote memoirs with similar stories.15 The late Jim Keith transcribed much of Claudia Mullen’s account in his book Mass Control. Keith presented similar public testimony of self-reported CIA victims Katherine Sullivan and the pseudonymous Brice Taylor. Keith further detailed a 1992 speech given by psychologist Dr. Corydon Hammond to an audience of psychology professionals at a regional conference on abuse and multiple personality. Hammond interviewed therapists nationwide to find that in about two-thirds of ritual abuse cases, perpetrators used “a highly developed and uniform technology of mind control.” Hammond said many of these cases had connections to the CIA and military, and employed a type of technology originally created by the CIA. He said one group that practiced this was the Process Church associated with the Manson family. In 1967, Charles Manson lived several blocks from the Process Church headquarters in the CIA- and Prankster-filled Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. Process leaders visited Manson in jail.16 All this deserves consideration when reviewing further aspects of Courtney Love’s life, raising the question of whether Courtney’s “psychotherapy” at three was part of a CIA-type victimization.

Harrison believes that Carroll sent Courtney to therapy in order to “brainwash” her. He doesn’t know if the therapy had anything to do with MK-Ultra, but he said that Linda Carroll kept Courtney away from him for years. Carroll had dated Frank Rodriguez in the late 1960s, married him in 1969, and moved to Eugene, Oregon with him near the Acid Test crowd. This crowd had followed Ken Kesey when he moved to his hometown near his brother Chuck Kesey. The transplanted Acid Test crowd who called themselves “Merry Pranksters” included Kesey, Ken Babbs and “Spider Lady” Nancy Van Brasch Hamren. Nancy Hamren had a boyfriend whose sister was married to Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia. Chuck Kesey had a business, the Springfield Creamery, which hired Hamren as an assistant, and then named their new yogurt, Nancy’s Yogurt, after her. Hank Harrison said that Linda Carroll became close with Hamren, while the Grateful Dead played benefit shows for the Springfield Creamery that popularized it. About a year after Carroll’s marriage to Frank Rodriguez, Rodriguez filed for divorce, claiming Carroll was sleeping with Courtney’s psychiatrist. In a memoir, Linda Carroll said she then moved to New Zealand in 1973 and left Courtney in Oregon. Within a year, Courtney was brought to New Zealand, but then sent back to Oregon again. Carroll claimed a former “family therapist” took the bizarre action of flying to New Zealand to pick Courtney up and take her back to the U.S. This is an extreme breach of boundaries, and of time and expense for a therapist. Most importantly, Courtney found Harrison when she was fourteen years old in 1979, and in Hillcrest Youth Correctional Facility in Salem, Oregon. Harrison got her out of Hillcrest and housed her for a while. Courtney evidently told Harrison that she was sexually molested by Frank Rodriguez and the psychiatrist. She also said that the doctor hypnotized her and gave her the psychohypnotic drugs Tuinal and Seconal, starting at least as early as age seven. Harrison said he met Rodriguez, and didn’t believe he would molest Courtney, but he never understood her tantrums over returning to her mother’s at three and four years old. Harrison said he didn’t know the psychiatrist, and believed Courtney was telling the truth about him, particularly knowing such exotic drugs at such a young age.17 MK-Ultra researchers Lee and Shlain cited CIA documents detailing their psychiatrists’ use of Seconal, in similar fashion to Scopolamine,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:310:4e5a298af657", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3595, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 311, "text": "least as early as age seven.

Also, as noted earlier, one of the CIA MK-Ultra “leading psychologists” John Gittinger accompanied two other MK-Ultra scientists to several Acid Tests, before the acid test crowd moved with Ken Kesey to the Eugene, Oregon area, and Linda Carroll ended up following them. MK-Ultra victim Claudia Mullen’s federal hearing testimony regarding Gittinger is supported by many victims who testified before the Australia Royal Commission. Gittinger took his split personality experiments to Australia by the mid-1970s. John Marks, a former U.S. State Department Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, obtained 16,000 FOIA-released CIA documents, some of which showed Gittinger’s work with drugs and hypnosis. Gittinger was also publicly accused of hypnosis and drug experimentation by Vermont dissociative identity (multiple personality) disorder victim Karen Wetmore.18 Another claim about Courtney appeared in a biography, Courtney Love: The Real Story, by Poppy Z. Brite. At sixteen years of age Courtney apparently worked for organized crime in Japan as a stripper in what Courtney called “the white slave trade,” implying it included prostitution. Hank Harrison said Courtney had found out how to become legally emancipated that year. Harrison said Courtney was beyond his control, and that he saw her start prostituting with a San Francisco madam he knew, who became a longtime advisor to Courtney. Harrison claims she introduced Courtney to high-paying clients such as Hewlett Packard scion David Packard (also a former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense). Harrison said Courtney went overseas with the Japanese Mafia both before and after meeting the madam. Courtney biographer Melissa Rossi also said Courtney reported prostituting in Taiwan as a teen.19 After her first six months in Japan, Courtney came back and gained access to a trust fund left by her maternal family. In 1980, while Courtney was in Japan, Harrison got a book deal to research a project in Dublin, Ireland. While still sixteen, Courtney evidently bought a thousand hits of LSD and stopped at her father’s temporary home in Dublin for several months. While there, she took acid with Steve O’Leary, who was working for the CIA. She and O’Leary then traveled to Liverpool, England, as well as Ockendon Vietnamese Refugee Camp in London’s suburbs. (A strange echo of Lennon assassin Mark Chapman spending time at the Arkansas Fort Chaffee Vietnamese Refugee camp.

(A strange echo of Lennon assassin Mark Chapman spending time at the Arkansas Fort Chaffee Vietnamese Refugee camp. Harrison said Ockendon was known as a CIA-owned group.)20 The Liverpool music scene was experiencing the biggest explosion in bands since the Beatles put that city on the map twenty years earlier. Perhaps this is why Courtney brought the thousand hits of acid to Liverpool, where she certainly expected to distribute them, according to Wallace and Halperin in their book Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain. If so, she followed in the same path as CIA MK-Ultra and British intelligence agents ready to introduce LSD and manipulate the minds of young, impressionable music industry leftists while also popularizing the drug.21 It is reported that Love quickly became a groupie for many of the United Kingdom’s top bands (Pogues, Adam Ant, Flock of Seagulls, Echoe and the Bunnymen), comically claiming to have lost her virginity to several different music stars. One of these music stars, Julian Cope of The Teardrop Explodes, described Courtney as destructive. For example, Hank Harrison said his daughter aborted a pregnancy after sex with the drummmer for the Pogues, breaking up his marriage. Reports of her destructiveness all over the city surely contributed to what researchers describe as her being “no longer welcome in Liverpool” by 1982.22 Years later, during Courtney’s marriage to Kurt Cobain, Cope went so far as to take out a large advertisement in the music press. His ad made an allusion to Love: “Free us from Nancy Spungen-fixated heroin A-holes who cling to our greatest rock groups and suck out their brains.” Cope was referring to the wife of Sex Pistols guitarist, Sid Vicious,23 who had a heroin problem when she met Vicious in New York and reportedly turned him on to the drug, before they both died young. Love physically resembled Spungeon and had unsuccessfully auditioned to play Spungeon in the film Sid and Nancy. 24 Reports continued of Courtney Love next traveling to Portland, Oregon where she also pushed drugs and caused chaos in that music scene. Many said Courtney was always “popping huge amounts of pills” including barbiturates, speed, and opiates: “[When] she had extra, she’d distribute them around as if they were candy.” There is no mention of how she could be able to get so much to distribute freely. As in Liverpool, she latched onto potential music stars. Rozz Rezabek, of the new-wave band Theater of Sheep, said she tried to mold him.25 Eventually tiring of the Portland scene, Courtney moved to Los Angeles, where she worked as a stripper.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt:312:0bd5307c2b42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 3597, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937584925", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584924_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 313, "text": "huge amounts of pills” including barbiturates, speed, and opiates: “[When] she had extra, she’d distribute them around as if they were candy.” There is no mention of how she could be able to get so much to distribute freely.

While there she tried to become a rock star, joining a band with Kat Bjelland and Jennifer Finch. Bjelland soon formed Babes in Toyland and moved to Minneapolis. They quickly kicked Courtney out of the band for being a sub-standard instrumentalist.26 When Courtney Love was nineteen, she went back to Portland to live with her father, but he soon kicked her out for having heroin parties and leaving syringes all over the basement. She then moved to Alaska where she stripped in a club and reportedly prostituted at the local Army base. Years later she is said to have told her first husband, James Mooreland, that she “slept with generals at the Army base who told her secret information that proved that the wars they got us into were for our own good.”27 By 1985 Courtney returned to Los Angeles and began a sexual affair with director Alex Cox. She gained a small role in his movie Sid and Nancy, about the Sex Pistols, and a starring role in another film. During this time she became friendly with more United Kingdom rock stars, including Elvis Costello and Joe Strummer. Courtney reportedly lived briefly in Strummer’s house with him and his wife. Strummer’s band, The Clash, is considered by many as one of the top radical leftist punk bands in music history.28 Courtney Love went on to spend some time in the New York music and film scene before moving back to Los Angeles in the late 1980s and starting a punk band, Hole, with Eric Erlandson. There she latched onto L.A’.s local punk music star James Mooreland and convinced him to marry her. Mooreland said he thought he was marrying a radical punk feminist, but instead ended up with a “right-wing Phyllis Diller.” He said he soon realized Courtney was a “junky stripper and prostitute,” who had used hired thugs to beat people, as various underworld characters were beholden to her. Similar to Kristen Pfaff ’s and Hank Harrison’s descriptions, Mooreland said Courtney seemed “as if she had another personality” capable of extreme violence. He was constantly threatened by Love, and when he refused one of her demands, a stranger actually beat him into submission.29 Love and Mooreland broke up after she got pregnant, used drugs during her pregnancy, and got an abortion. Around 1986, Courtney Love reportedly went into surgery for a nose job.

Around 1986, Courtney Love reportedly went into surgery for a nose job. Within the next five years she had added breast implants and liposuction. After the divorce from Mooreland, she dated Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails (one time and then stalked him) and was dating Smashing Pumpkins’ lead singer Billy Corgan, whose album Gish was heading to the top of the charts just before Nirvana’s Nevermind. Former bandmate Lori Barbero said Love left Corgan for Cobain in late summer 1991, immediately after being introduced to him.30 Kurt’s friends said Cobain had only tried heroin a few times before he met Courtney, but she apparently got Cobain into a daily intravenous habit. For example, Cobain’s longtime friend Alice Wheeler said Courtney did this “to control him. She’s very sophisticated that way.”31 During Cobain’s last 12 months, Love supplied many addicts with money and heroin, surrounding Cobain with them. This included “nanny and gun nut,” Mike “Cali” Dewitt, who admitted his “spy role” for Love to author Everett True. Cobain fired Dewitt but Love rehired him. Love also forced Cali’s friend, Rene Naverette, on Cobain as a bodyguard. Love finally had Eric Erlandson at the house often, even during Cobain’s last days, making the scene similar to Rolling Stone Brian Jones’s death scene. Well-documented evidence suggesting Courtney’s role in Cobain’s death, along with the total lack of police investigation about it, speaks to a high level of U.S. intelligence protection.32 Following Cobain’s death, Courtney Love promoted LSD and crack cocaine. Barbara Walters conducted a high-profile interview of Love in 1995 for a TV audience of 25 million viewers. Love made bizarre statements lauding LSD, telling Walters her father gave her acid as a kid, stating, “He wanted to make a superior race, and by giving children acid you could do that.”33 Immunity from criminal prosecution continued. Love physically attacked numerous people, both men and women, with few or no legal repercussions, leading many to avoid discussing her out of fear. These attacks included some women who had been close to Cobain, such as singer Mary Lou Lord and Kathleen Hanna, lead singer of the seminal “riot grrl” band Bikini Kill. Riot grrl was a movement of female empowerment through punk music and zines (small-press magazines). Love punched Hanna in the face at the 1995 Lollapalooza Fest. She pled guilty and was ordered to receive anger management counseling. Love also attacked journalist Victoria Clarke and media photographer Belissa Cohen.

She pled guilty and was ordered to receive anger management counseling. Love also attacked journalist Victoria Clarke and media photographer Belissa Cohen. In separate incidents, she punched them in the face and dragged them by their hair. Cohen sued Love in a civil trial. Out of these multiple physical assaults, reports claim Love only received one misdemeanor sentence.35 By 2012, Courtney Love’s actions were so injurious that her daughter Frances filed a protective order against her. The judge granted the order to Frances Cobain and several of her relatives, including Frances’s aunt, Kimberly Cobain, who had previously gained legal custody of then 17-yearold Frances in 2009.36 W hile one musician died of a heroin overdose in 1990, much of the chaos in the Seattle music scene started after Courtney Love arrived in the early fall of 1991. Susan Silver, who helped manage Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and the Screaming Trees, said, “After Courtney hooked up with Kurt, it was the first time anyone had ever publicly trash-talked anybody in the community. It was really awful to have somebody with this addict behavior of divide-and-conquer. We had this really lovely, cohesive, supportive community, and this tornado came and started blowin’ things apart.”37 In late October of 1991, noted Seattle poet, and Cobain’s friend, Steve Bernstein reportedly committed suicide by slitting his throat. Bernstein’s friend, film director Oliver Stone, believed he was murdered. It must be emphasized that though there is no direct evidence implicating Love at the scene of Cobain’s death, the violence was not the first in a series of sinister events involving individuals with whom she had some connection. By early 1993, the frontman for Mudhoney, Mark Arm, and the bassist for Alice In Chains, Mike Starr, both near-fatally overdosed, after reportedly shooting up with Courtney in separate incidents.38 One singer, Mia Zapata, had come to Seattle and was considered the “queen of the scene” for her inspirational singing and guidance of other female musicians. She had leftist roots as a relative of the famous Mexican revolutionary Emilliano Zapata. By 1993 Mia Zapata’s band, the Gits, had toured with Nirvana, and were about to sign a major-label record deal. The Gits organized a tour to shadow the U.S. tour of Pope John Paul II, to denounce the church’s politics. One month prior to the tour, on July 7, 1993, Zapata was found laid out in a street with her arms straight out and legs together, forming a cross. She had been raped and murdered.

Seattle musicians didn’t trust the police investigation, and hired a private detective. The band Tad organized a benefit show to raise money for that purpose. Nirvana joined in and was scheduled to co-headline with Tad. Backstage before the show, Courtney Love started a physical fight with the girlfriend of Tad’s lead singer, knocking over a lamp that started a fire, and nearly sabotaged the benefit concert.39 Another close friend of Cobain’s, Kristin Pfaff, had briefly joined Courtney Love’s band Hole for their hit album Live Through This. Pfaff, who was reportedly happy to leave Seattle and Hole, died ten weeks after Cobain. A friend found her dead in her bathtub, of an alleged overdose. Pfaff had formerly been in the Minneapolis band Janitor Joe, who wrote antiwar songs such as “Big Metal Birds.” Wallace and Halperin quoted many who knew Pfaff. Everyone reported how peaceful, friendly and talented she was. Her band Janitor Joe had received critical acclaim. Courtney Love and her ex-boyfriend, Eric Erlandson, talked Pfaff into joining Hole for their major-label debut with Geffen Records. Pfaff’s family tried to talk her out of it, concerned about Erlandson’s and Love’s drug use. But with a generous financial offer made to her, Kristen Pfaff saw a chance to make a living with music, so she decided to join Hole on a temporary basis.40 Erlandson soon coupled with Pfaff romantically. Within weeks Pfaff was hooked on heroin. Her brother, who relocated to Seattle, said Courtney Love supplied Pfaff with heroin and syringes. A good friend said Love emotionally traumatized Pfaff, who would make musical suggestions only to have Love scream at her and threaten to fire her.41 It didn’t help Love and Pfaff’s relationship that Kurt Cobain was attracted to Pfaff, with her beautiful long black hair, striking figure, and similar passions. Cobain said in confidence to his close friend Dylan Carlson, “She’s a fucking talented musician. She’s also a beautiful soul. I think she’s so beautiful, but if I ever told her that and Courtney found out, it would be hell.”42 Pfaff and Cobain spent hours talking about similar interests, but when Cobain gave Kristen a copy of the novel Perfume, which had greatly inspired him, “Courtney hit the ceiling.”43 When Hole’s Live Through This eventually came out, critics credited Pfaff’s bass playing for the band’s unique sound. Even Erlandson told Spin magazine, “The day Kristen joined Hole is when we took off.” But Pfaff didn’t care.

Even Erlandson told Spin magazine, “The day Kristen joined Hole is when we took off.” But Pfaff didn’t care. She had already quit her “nightmarish” relationship with Erlandson around Christmas of 1993, and, with Hole’s Live Through This completed, she left Seattle and moved back to Minneapolis.44 In Minneapolis, Pfaff awaited the start of Hole’s summer tour, to which she was still contractually committed. Pfaff’s mother Janet said that Cobain asked Pfaff to join him in a new band he wanted to start without the rest of Nirvana. When Kristen heard about Kurt Cobain’s death in April of 1994, “she was devastated. She stopped doing drugs the day Kurt died.” Pfaff entered a detox center and started straightening out her life. She then rejoined her old band, Janitor Joe, and “was adamant she would never go back to Hole.”45 Paul Erickson, to drive a storage truck with her to Seattle. According to Love and Death authors Wallace and Halperin, in 1994 in Seattle there were “said to be more heroin addicts per square foot in Kristen’s Capitol Hill neighborhood … than in any other district in the United States.” Pfaff ’s friend Erickson slept in the truck with Pfaff ’s belongings to protect them from junkie thieves. A bandmate of Pfaff’s said she called him that night sounding “as chipper and happy as she’s ever been.”46 At 8 : 30P.M ., Erickson said, he saw Eric Erlandson enter Pfaff ’s apartment and leave again roughly half an hour later. Erickson found Pfaff unconscious in an inch of water in the tub the next morning. She was dead before police arrived. Police said they found “syringes and narcotics paraphernalia in the bathroom,” and pages were ripped out of Pfaff’s journal. The same coroner who had declared Kurt Cobain’s death a suicide claimed Pfaff died of “Acute Opiate Intoxication” caused by an accidental “[injectable] use of the drug.” 47 Police rebuffed Kristen’s mother’s requests to investigate her daughter’s death as a possible homicide. Kristen’s brother Jason suggested Erlandson may have killed Pfaff. “It could have been a dose of dirty [overly pure] heroin. The fact that Kristen was clean for so long combined with a dose of dirty heroin would have been enough to kill her.” Jason was explaining how her tolerance to heroin was likely lower, and it wouldn’t have taken as much heroin to get high, but that it being overly pure would have killed her more easily.48 Evidence suggests Eric Erlandson as a suspect in Pfaff ’s death, yet there is no mention of police investigating him.

Again, police inaction appears purposeful. With the mass of evidence that Courtney Love carried out MK-Ultra-type activities with criminal impunity, Erlandson’s actions regarding Pfaff and his partnership with Love at this time suggest his collaboration. 5 Wallace and Halperin, Love and Death, pp. 259-60, 267-70; https://www.facebook.com/ pages/Kill-Allen-Wrench/182148178469543. 6 For Broy having a “ranch” in Riverside, CA, and playing with both the Mentors and Kill Allen Wrench, Wallace and Halperin, Love and Death, pp. 261, 269.
